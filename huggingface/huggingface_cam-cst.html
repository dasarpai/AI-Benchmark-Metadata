</h3>
<p>The Children’s Book Test (CBT) is designed to measure directly how well language models can exploit wider linguistic context. The CBT is built from books that are freely available.</p>
<p>This dataset contains four different configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>V</code>: where the answers to the questions are verbs.</li>
<li><code>P</code>: where the answers to the questions are pronouns.</li>
<li><code>NE</code>: where the answers to the questions are named entities.</li>
<li><code>CN</code>: where the answers to the questions are common nouns.</li>
</ul>

		Annotation process

<p>From the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/">homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After allocating books to either training, validation or test sets, we formed example ‘questions’ from chapters in the book by enumerating 21 consecutive sentences. In each question, the first 20 sentences form the context, and a word is removed from the 21st sentence, which becomes the query. Models must identify the answer word among a selection of 10 candidate answers appearing in the context sentences and the query. For finer-grained analyses, we evaluated four classes of question by removing distinct types of word: Named Entities, (Common) Nouns, Verbs and Prepositions.</p>
