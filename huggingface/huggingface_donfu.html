Also, Hestia was thought of as being present in every offering fire in all temples and received first offering in sacrifices.

For example, Sekhmet, goddess of ferocious war, was sometimes shown with the head a lioness, as lions are ferocious creatures. Similarly Anubis was shown with a jackal head because the jackal was associated with the necropolis and Anubis was a god of the dead. \n\nThere are also theriomorphic depictions, where gods are shown entirely in animal form. These are quite common, and in fact were the most common representations of gods in the very earliest periods of Egyptian history. For example, Anubis as a black jackal, or Thoth as either an ibis or a white baboon. Taweret was even a hybrid of hippo, crocodile and lioness. \n\nIt is the same reasoning behind why Christians equate Jesus with the lamb, or why we give angels wings.&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;stackexchange-mythology&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;answer_score\&quot;: 32,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: 34,\n  \&quot;tags\&quot;: \&quot;egyptian, animals\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;INSTRUCTION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Who gave Hermes his winged shoes?\nMany tools and weapons were given to the gods as gifts in order to perform their daily tasks.

All else was empty, silent, endless, dark. Then, Love was born bringing along the beginning of order. From Love emerged Light, followed by Gaea, the earth.\n\nSo before Gaea, there was Chaos, Erebus, Night, and Love. Love then created Light, which in turn had Gaea. Then, Erebus and Night has Ether and Day, heavenly and earthly light respectively and Night alone had \&quot;all things that dwell in the darkness haunting mankind.\&quot; This includes Death, Fate, and Sleep. Gaea then gave birth to Uranus, who she then married.\n\nSo, there were powerful beings before Gaea and Uranus.

According to a new interpretation, the oracular sound originated from bronze objects hanging from oak branches and sounded with the wind blowing, similar to a wind chime.\n\nHowever, we have no way of knowing if the piece of wood that fell from the stern and killed Jason was part of the keel (and thus had originated in Dodona).\n\nFurthermore, mythologically it doesn't quite fit.

All children were part of at least one major variation of the Twelve Olympians and - with the exception of Hestia - had temples honouring them. 

Hestia was Cronus firstborn and her sanctuary was the hearth of the Prytaneion, the political and religious center of the community. Also, Hestia was thought of as being present in every offering fire in all temples and received first offering in sacrifices. Thus, she didn't need temples of her own.

Of course there may have been temples honouring Hestia that we simply don't know about. After all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</span></div></div>

The use of Minotaur as a _species_ name, and the idea that more of these creatures exist, is a purely 20th Century concept, exampled in such works as _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ and Thomas Burnett Swann's _Minotaur Trilogy_. In Dante's _Inferno_ (14th C) he is still very much the singular Minotaur.

For example, Sekhmet, goddess of ferocious war, was sometimes shown with the head a lioness, as lions are ferocious creatures. Similarly Anubis was shown with a jackal head because the jackal was associated with the necropolis and Anubis was a god of the dead. 

There are also theriomorphic depictions, where gods are shown entirely in animal form. These are quite common, and in fact were the most common representations of gods in the very earliest periods of Egyptian history. For example, Anubis as a black jackal, or Thoth as either an ibis or a white baboon. Taweret was even a hybrid of hippo, crocodile and lioness. 

It is the same reasoning behind why Christians equate Jesus with the lamb, or why we give angels wings.</span></div></div>

During the Titanomachy (the Titan war), which was fought between the Titans) and the Olympians, the goddess Styx sided with the Olympians.

Once the war was won, Zeus, king of the Olympians, promised that every oath be sworn on Styx's name, as a sign of the greatest respect.

He also proceeded to name the River Styx after her.

Achilles was dipped in it as a child and was rewarded with invulnerability, except for his heel, which was where his mother was holding him, hence the term : Achilles' heel.

  1. Acheron \- the river of woe

Present works of fiction present Mjölnir as a hammer of unbelievable power, which can only be used by the worthy.

But, when the Mjölnir is given to Thor, its properties are described:

> Then he gave the hammer to Thor, and said that Thor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short.

It says nothing of the "worthiness" of the weilder. Is there any significant evidence in Norse mythology about the Mjölnir and the worthiness of its user?</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">As your quote shows, the story of it's creation makes no such specification. 

If stealing it qualifies as "using" (I believe, in the the Marvel universe, simply lifting the hammer qualifies), the Þrymskviða from the Poetic Edda tells the story of the giant Þrymr stealing Mjollnir, in order to extort the gods into giving him Freyja as his wife. 

> "I have Hloritha's  
>  Hammer hidden:  
>  Under eight miles  
>  of earth it lies,  
>  And such no one  
>  shall see again  
>  Save he first bring me  
>  Freyja to wife!" 

It does depend on your definition of "worthy", but I think Þrymr's intentions disqualify him by most reasonable definitions. 

Seems to indicate that the worthiness requirement is a Marvel invention.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Well, before Gaea and Uranus there were a few gods, but not many. In the Greek story of creation it says

> In the beginning there was only Chaos. Then out of the void appeared Erebus, the unknowable place where death dwells, and Night. All else was empty, silent, endless, dark. Then, Love was born bringing along the beginning of order. From Love emerged Light, followed by Gaea, the earth.

So before Gaea, there was Chaos, Erebus, Night, and Love. Love then created Light, which in turn had Gaea. Then, Erebus and Night has Ether and Day, heavenly and earthly light respectively and Night alone had "all things that dwell in the darkness haunting mankind." This includes Death, Fate, and Sleep. Gaea then gave birth to Uranus, who she then married.

So, there were powerful beings before Gaea and Uranus. How these beings came into existence is less clear, but it seems that how it all starts with Chaos is similar to the creation story for Christians. Chaos was just there.</span></div></div>

In Ovid's Metamorphosis he is even depicted as quite a powerful and vengeful god.  
There seems to be quite a mismatch between both visions of the supposedly same character: is it possible the Orphic cult was in fact worshiping another imported character, foreign to the Greek/Roman pantheon, that was later assimilated to Dionysus?</span></div></div>

  * festivals
  * fertility
  * the wilds
  * crops
  * sanity



These are centrally important to the daily lives of average citizens for the time. Sure Zeus is the king, and sure Poseidon is incredibly powerful, but I need my crops to grow, sons to help me run the farm and carry on my name and lets face it an opportunity to drown my sorrows once in a while. 

Orphism espouses the idea of an immortal soul and in a similar fashion to Hindu reincarnation the goal of the follower is to exit a cyclical pattern of death and rebirth in human bodies to become one with the gods.

Who better to worship and lead such a 'religion' than a man who became a god himself.</span></div></div>

When Persephone was abducted by Hades, Demeter gave them the bodies of birds so that they could assist in the search for the girl (in some versions they requested this, in others , e.g. that of Ovid, they were punished by Demeter because she held them responsible for Persephone's abduction - due to negligence).

For example, 

From Wikipedia article on Ragnarök (emphasis mine):

> In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of **future events** , including a great battle foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors . Ragnarök is an important event in the Norse canon, and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory.

Not wanting to make the question broad, I'm putting it in scope of the Norse mythology and it becomes: **If the events of Ragnarok are set in the future, how is it that it is detailed so greatly at present?**</span></div></div>

In the Gylfaginning (part of the prose Edda), which quotes extensively the latter, the tale is told by three characters in Ásgard (Hárr, the king, Janhárr and Thridi). 

Presumably in the first case it is a vision that the völva had while in the second case the characters are, I think, meant to be omniscient. 

Alternatively, an interesting theory is the one argued by Rudolf Simek (in _Lexikon der germanischen Mythologie_ ), according to which the norse timeline is a palingenesis (i.e. time is cyclical): Ragnarokr being, according to him, a prelude to the creation myth. In this case these events would be set both in the future and in the past, which would explain how the völva and the three characters from Ásgard can recount it as if it already happened.</span></div></div>

Unlike modern monotheistic religions that only accept one, omnipotent and omniscient god, ancient Greek religion has a pantheon of fallible gods. Yet it was also well developed, where the pantheon has hierarchy (Zeus, king of gods) and lineage.

Was there ever a time and place where the religion evolved into a monotheistic form? That is, only accepting one god, rejecting the others as false ones or manifestations of the one true god. For example, ancient Egyptian religion briefly gave rise to Atenism, the offshoot religion that states the sun-disc _Aten_ was the only god.

Did a similar thing happen to Greek religion? If so, which god became the one? Or was it an amalgam?</span></div></div>

There's one theory, put forth by Elizabeth Kessler in _Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos_ that "two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E.". The only evidence cited, however, is a mosaic where Dionysus is the central figure, so I'd take this with a grain of salt.</span></div></div>

As I understand it, it was common practice for a playwright to retell a well-known story with the details changed to suit the playwright's needs. A tidy way to avoid a lot of tedious exposition. 

In Antigone), this leads to some significantly different endings:

  * In Sophocles' play, she is imprisoned and hangs herself, Creon has a change of heart too late, and Haemon commits suicide. 

  * In Euripides' play, Dionysus intercedes, and everyone lives happily ever after. 

  * In Hyginus' interpretation, Antigone is hidden away, and discovered years later, when she is finally executed by Haemon, in spite of intercession from Heracles.

For us, since Sophocles' _Antigone_ is so well known, that has become canonical to us.</span></div></div>

Cúchulainn is immune to this curse. As I understand it, he is immune because he is yet a beardless youth, and so a curse upon the men does not apply to him. This makes sense, since, when an exhausted Cúchulainn sleeps three days, the boys of Ulster come to the defense.

I've also read that the explanation of his immunity is due to his demi-godhood, being that he is the son of Lugh, the Long Arm.

So why isn't Cúchulainn's charioteer, Loeg mac Riangabra, affected? I can't find where it's stated he's older that Cúchulainn, but if I'm mistaken on that point, I must not be alone

Who was the first person to translate part or all of Homer's works, the Iliad and/or the Odyssey, to Latin? Have these translations survived to current times? 

My original motivation for the question is the following: Devecseri Gábor has written an epistle about the art of poetic translation addressed to Horace, the ancient Roman poet. From this, it seems like Devecseri considered Horace (as well as Babits Mihály) his master and role model in poetry and translation. I had mistakenly assumed that this was because Horace also translated the Homeric epics, but it turns out this was a false assumption.</span></div></div>

**Livius Andronicus** (c. 284 – c. 204 BC) was possibly the first who translated the Odyssey into Latin, but his translation has not survived. There have been many Latin translations of Homer over the centuries, but the **oldest surviving** seems to be by **Leontius Pilatus** (died 1366): see catalog entry of a modern publication of that translation. This answer contributed by [Lindert.]

Educated Romans read Homer in the original Greek, so I'm not sure there was great demand for a written literary translation into Latin. There was the Ilias Latina, which was kind of "downmarket" (not a full translation, and not very literary). This answer contributed by [AnonMoos.]

Attius Labeo was renowned for the badness of his translations of Homer, so there was clearly a market. Comment by [Paul Barlow.]</span></div></div>

In _Lludd and Lleuelys_, three plagues fall upon Britain. The first consists of a fierce race, the Coranians; the second consists of a terrible noise which renders the Britons terrified, and the third is a plague of disappearing food and drink.

Lludd, after council with his brother, Lleuelys, king of France, figures out how to end the first two plagues, and then fights the "mighty man of magic" who is responsible for the third, defeating him. The magician pleads for mercy.

> All the losses that ever I have caused thee," said he, "I will make thee atonement for, equal to what I have taken. And I will never do the like from this time forth. But thy faithful vassal will I be." And the king accepted this from him.

The ancient Greek gods lived on the famous Mount Olympus, which is an actual mountain in Greece.

The Romans borrowed quite a bit of mythology from the Greeks, so I at first assumed that the Roman gods lived somewhere similar, if not in the exact same place (though perhaps with the mountain renamed and moved somewhere else). Strangely enough, though, I have not been able to find any ancient accounts that make that claim - nor any mention of the home of the Roman gods at _all_ , save for on a certain (rather untrustworthy and often inaccurate) question-and-answer site.

>  _Jam statue tandem gravibus aerumnis modum_
> 
> O mighty ruler of **Olympus** , judge of all the world,  
>  set now at length a limit to our crushing cares, an end to our disasters.

In the rest of the play, Senea used Roman names to refer to the deities, such as Juno instead of Hera:

> **[213-4]** _Sequitur a primo statim infesta **Juno_**
> 
> From his very birth relentless Juno has pursued him.

Hence, the Roman equivalent of Olympos _is_ Olympos.</span></div></div>

Did Greek mythology develop dynamically or statically? Let me explain a little more what I mean by "dynamic" and "static".

**Static:** Given the religious element of the stories, I could imagine that they were very "official", implying that they were created in a relatively short time and by a relatively small group off people. Without many extensions or modifications afterwards.

**Dynamic:** I could also imagine that the stories were more naturally developed, like an on-going ad hoc collection of stories. A scenario where anyone could just make up a myth/god and where the popular ones got picked up and written down?

In Burkert's "Graechische Religion..." (Intro/2: sources), we can find the following reasons: \- as there were no holy scriptures there was no "canon" whatsoever to tell apart "canonical" myths from "non-canonical" \- myths were continuously being rewritten, as poets were composing new hymns to the gods for celebrations or contests.

In "Elliniki Mythologia" (edited by Ekdotiki Athinon) there is a description of the process of myth creation (pg.24-26) and, while to big to transcript here, its main points is that, at first, myths were created by the people from fairy-tale-like stories that they were telling the children and, then, it passed on to the poets. 

Plus, it definitely says on pg.26:"so, greek myths were processed and reprocessed for approximately 1,500 years".</span></div></div>

Then went the plow so hard and deep that it tore up the land, and the oxen drew it westward into the sea, until it stood still in a sound.

One thing to consider is the way the plowing of Denmark is related in the _Ynglinga saga_ (which is the first chapter of the _Heimskringla_ , which was also written by Snorri Sturluson):

> Then he [Odin] sent Gefion across the sound to the north to discover new countries; and she came to King Gylve, who gave her a ploughgate of land. Then she went to Jotunheim, and bore four sons to a giant, and transformed them into a yoke of oxen.

Here it is explicitly said that she had those four sons precisely for the purpose of having them plough the land of Gylfi. From that, one can assume that which Giant fathered them didn't really matter to her, as long as it was a Giant, hence, maybe, why the Giant remained anonymous.</span></div></div>

Campbell originally wrote in 1949, with access to thousands of years of comparative culture and a literate, open, secular, post-Enlightenment society. Did any ancient scholars (let's define "ancient" as "pre-Gutenberg press") draw similar conclusions about various religions and myths?

The ancients as far as I am aware did not recognize Campbell's "monomyth." They did, however, recognize a few things. First, at least with Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures, they all engaged in a process of _interpretatio_ , through which various heroes and deities were seen as the same. Heracles was Melqart, though the Greeks called both "Heracles", one "Tyrian" and the other "Greek." (Herodotus, 2.43–45, Cicero, _De Natura Deorum_ , 3.43)This was very common.4

Another process common especially during the Hellenistic era was something called "Euhemerism," named after Euhemerus, a Greek philosopher who thought e.g. the gods were once kings and mighty men who subsequently were worshiped as gods. This presumes an interpretation of similarities, though not of journeys, but of kingship.5

The myth of Pandora is basically the story of a woman who is given a box by the gods, and told not to open it. Of course, she opens the box, and evil is released to the world.

Is it possible that the box represents a womb? I think that makes a lot of sense, because it's a cavity with an opening, and things come out of it (that were never seen on earth before). The myth also is a commentary on gender, because it's a woman who releases evil to the world, and Pandora's husband is at fault only because he is stupid enough to marry her.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">It is 100% supportable that the "box" represents the womb in Hesiod's version of the myth from his Theogony. In brief:

  * In the Theogony, Hesiod never mentions any vessel save Pandora herself.

  * Pandora is cast as the mother of the "race of women" who were created to vex men (i.e. they are the source of evil named by Hesiod in the Theogony.) 

  * In other versions of the myth, no "box" is mentioned, but instead a _pithou_ meaning "jar" for wine or oil. (If wine, it could represent blood, and oil is a lubricant.)

  * The idea of woman as vessel is a major point in Apollo's notorious arguments in Orestes' defense in The Eumenides, demonstrating the existence of this concept in Ancient Greek thought.




You can find a more detailed explanation of this element of the myth here, as well as a discussion of the possible meaning in Aesop and Hesiod.</span></div></div>

I remember reading somewhere that in Norse mythology dwarves and dark elves are the same thing. Then I started reading Gylfaginning and it sounded like they were different, but then later on they send someone to get help from the dwarves in Svartalfheim, which I'm pretty sure is probably 'dark elf home.'

So, are dwarves and dark elves the same thing? Or are they different beings that happen to live in the same place? Something else?

  * Asgard, realm of the Aesir
  * Vanaheim, realm of the Vanir
  * Alfheim, realm of the (light) elves
  * Midgard, realm of men
  * Jotunheim, realm of the Jotun (giants)
  * Muspell, realm of fire
  * Niflheim, realm of ice
  * Hel, real of the dishonorable dead



The missing ninth world depends on the source. The two most frequently cited are Svartalfheim, realm of the dark elves, and Nidavellir, realm of the dwarves. As there are supposed to be exactly nine worlds, not ten, the logical conclusion is that Svartalfheim and Nidavellir are the same. Thus dark elves and dwarves refer to the same creature.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The full story (in short) of Oedipus is that his father heard a prophecy that his son will kill him.

After he found out that he in fact married his mother and killed his father he took his eyes out. 

Basically the prophecy that Oedipus' father heard was in fact a self fulfilling prophecy. If he never had ordered his son to be killed, he would never return to kill him. 

So since Oedipus killed his father, fell in love with and married his own mother, the Oedipus syndrome was named after him. To simplify things enormously, the complex refers to a subconscious love for one's mother, and thus jealousy towards one's father (as the father has a legitimate relationship with the mother).</span></div></div>

The last of these is the Deluge.

_The Epic of Ziusudra_, also partially lost, is a very similar version of the story. Again, Enki helps one ruler survive the flood brought on by the gods in an attempt to completely wipe out mankind.

I understand that the brothers endured a lot of tough challenges, especially from Loki (who tried to disturb them in the form of a fly).

But still, Mjölnir is clearly faulty, which is supported by this quote from The Prose Edda, translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916):

> Then he gave the hammer to Thor, and said that Thor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; **but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short.**

So, a bet is a bet, and when it is betted upon a head, it should/would be much more intolerant.

So, why and how did the brothers won the bet when the hammer is clearly faulty? On what criterion is the quality/bet gauged?</span></div></div>

Apparently, the Aesir decided this was the case:

Ragnarök and all its ills ended when the earth was submerged in the ocean. Why then does Nidhoggr emerge, bearing corpses in his feathers?</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">This is a really good question; it is one which even experts on Norse mythology has trouble finding a good answer for. Gro Steinsland, in _Fornnordisk religion_ , lists three different suggested explanations:

  1. A suggestion by Else Munkdal that Níðhöggr is there as a kind of monstrous transport: the corpses he bears are being moved into the new world to be reborn. 
  2. That he is there as proof that even the reborn world is not perfect: the cosmology is cyclical, and conflict will soon begin again, after a short respite.
  3. Steinsland's own suggestion, that Níðhöggr is there as a framing device. Steinsland argues that as the new world is in many ways show to be better, the cosmology has to be linear, and Níðhöggr has no place in the new world order. Instead, he is there to move listeners back to their own world, and the Völva can sink back from trance.



From what I can tell, 2. is the most widespread explanation.</span></div></div>

Next, "parts" is a not particularly helpful translation. The better one is the third one you shared, "allotted portions" (or apportioned lots). It instead refers to their activity. There were three Fates in Greek mythology, which you can read if you just look a little further in the same paragraph you link to:

> Klotho, whose name means "Spinner," spinned the thread of life. Lakhesis, whose name means "Apportioner of Lots"--being derived from a word meaning to receive by lot--, measured the thread of life. Atropos (or Aisa), whose name means "She who cannot be turned," cut the thread of life.

The "parts" or "apportioned lots" refers to their activity. The spin, weave, and cut the "thread of life", so to speak. The life you get is the life they allot you.</span></div></div>

On the FOX show _Sleepy Hollow,_ the Big Bad this season calls herself Pandora, and she has a box from which supernatural evil things come, but one of the protagonists says she's from Sumeria.

I've tried to research this, but I can't find any equivalents to the Greek Pandora myth (woman is created with many gifts from many gods, including intense curiosity; she is given as a wife to punish someone; she's given a jar/box/container and told "don't open it" but she does, and all manner of evils fly out to plague humanity; hope remains) in Sumerian mythology.

However, both endeavor to explain why the world is toilsome, and since the world is toilsome and women were easy targets for blame (especially in a male-dominated society), it's not impossible these are entirely independent of each other.

And even if there is some relationship between the two, the way the Greek story is told is without parallel.</span></div></div>

The name is ultimately Semitic, and came into Greek as the Aramaic שׁוּעַ (Yeshua), from the Hebrew יְהוֹשֻׁעַ (Yehoshuah, which in English we usually "translate" to Joshua).

There is no relationship between that name and Zeus, which is proto-Indo-European and only looks similar to Iesus in its late form—its stem is dio- (whence Dios "of Zeus", and its many derivatives in names like Dionysus and Diomedes or even Dioscuri, the two "sons of Zeus").

The reality which lay behind this notion was the presence in Tibet of an elusive long horned wild “antelope” called the chiru by the Tibetan nomads, or, by the Mongolians, the orongo (colour plate 7).

That said, that didn't stop the ancients from theorizing. Strabo (9.18) thought Ogygia was in the Atlantic Ocean, while Plutarch ( _Moralia_ 12.26) said it was "five day's sail from Britain".

Interestingly, and there's a distinct lack of good research on this topic, but Ogyges, whence the name Ogygia, was tied to both Boeotia and Thessaly (via flood-myths) in early myths. That's clearly not the Ogygia that Homer had in mind, though.</span></div></div>

(Alan Dundes)

Folklorists have developed these tools called Motif Indexes. I'm not quite sure what you mean by "non human creature", but creatures like phoenix have entries in the index. A motif index would then list every culture that contains a myth/story about phoenix. **The key here is that there isn't a single example that we can point to where the motif is universal** , i.e. it is present in the stories of every culture known to mankind.

So no, there isn't an example of a "non human creature" that "appears universally or nearly universally across many cultures myths."

If you're interested in the similarities and differences between the stories of different cultures, then I would recommend that you learn more about motif indexes.</span></div></div>

Are there any books/essays/discussions about the idea that ancient cultures didn't value individualism (for a variety of reasons) like we do today, and so poetry, literature, and art were primarily about celebrating deities or deities interacting with archetypal humans, rather than so much of what we see from recent history (say the last two thousand or so years), where art works develop towards a lack of deity, even no deity at all, or any kind of super human interaction, instead featuring a story of everyday humanity?

Tantalus, who was a bad person, was sent to the fields of punishment.

So what was symbolized of this punishment, to starve and thirst forevermore?</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">There are two main reasons attributed to Tantalus's punishment, sources from theoi.com:

  * He was invited to Olympus by Zeus, ate the food of the gods (ambrosia and nectar), and was given divine secrets, which he then blabbed (Hom. Od. xi. 582).
  * He wanted to test the gods and see how perceptive they were, so he invited them to his home for dinner, and killed his son Pelops and cooked and served the boy to the gods. (Hygin. Fab. 83 ; Serv. ad Aen. vi. 603, ad Georg. iii. 7.)



Theoi mentions other stories which I've never heard before, so I don't know how common they are (including one which says he fell in love with Zeus's cup-bearing boy Ganymede and carried him off!). 

In any case, the punishment is that food and drink always seem to be within his grasp but are never attainable, and his two major sins both involved food which should not have been eaten.</span></div></div>

As writing an answer to my own question, I came across this,

> 
> "He [Solon] also spent some time in studies with Psenophis of Heliopolis [in Egypt] and Sonkhis (Sonchis) of Sais, who were very learned priests. From these, as Plato says, he heard the story of the lost Atlantis, and tried to introduce it in a poetical form to the Greeks."

The only real original source we have for the story of Atlantis is Plato. He used it as an allegory to help describe his vision of the best way to run things politically. It was sort of his equivalent of Thomas More's Utopia). The society itself appears to be very maritime (like Greece and decidedly unlike Egypt). It doesn't look at all like a myth an inland river-centered Egyptian would come up with.

All other sources we have for the story came after Plato, and seem to be based on his stories. So the most likely (and currently favored) supposition is that Plato himself made it up. Even if he didn't, he might as well have, because that's all we have.</span></div></div>

The following Bible passages mention “ _Anakim_ ” and “ _Anak_ ”:

  * Num 13:22; 13:28; 13:33
  * Deut 1:28; 2:10-11; 2:21, 9:2
  * Josh 11:21-22; 14:12; 14:15; 15:13-14; 21:11

They sound similar.

Is there any known connection between the biblical _Anakim_ / _Anak_ entities and the Sumerian Anunnaki gods?</span></div></div>

Anunnaki, as I explained in another post, means sons of An. While the terminology is the same, there is nothing in common between those 2 words.

EDIT : The sumerian language is apparently an language isolate. So it is just a coincidence.

More than that, in the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, an hypothesis linked this word with a goddess from the eastern cultural block, but it is not linked to a semitic deity. Still, I don't see any link with the sumerian gods.</span></div></div>

I'll admit my Norse mythology is rather rusty, but I do recall after an incident these two particular gods saw each other as mortal enemies and would eventually kill each other at Ragnarok.

The only detail to add was that evidently Heimdall and Loki fought as seals. That is really all we know about it.

Further than this, as have already been noted, Loki and Heimdall will fight and kill eachother at Ragnarök. They also interact in the _Lokasenna_ , a poem where Loki shows up at a party and insults the other gods. Heimdall does not seem to be under more fire than his fellow gods.</span></div></div>

It is also good to be aware that the Epic comes to us in various versions. There is no (right now) any complete version of the myth per se. It is just a reconstruction from different tablets.

Now the Epic does not give any rational explanation about the proportion. Just remind it is barely a detail trying to make clear Gilgamesh is far beyond any normal human being. As long as it is striking you enough as being "totally abnormal" the one who wrote it did succeed.</span></div></div>

However, we have no way of knowing if the piece of wood that fell from the stern and killed Jason was part of the keel (and thus had originated in Dodona).

Furthermore, mythologically it doesn't quite fit. Dodona was Zeus' sanctuary and Jason's death was an act of Hera (for Jason had betrayed Medea). These two were very rarely allied, and Hera had no reason to risk angering Zeus.</span></div></div>

Raven found the first men in a clam shell (you can find a related sculpture here which was shown on the Canadian $20 bill from 2004-2012) and he played a role in the conception of the first children.

</h1>
<p>This dataset is taken from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">https://archive.org/details/stackexchange</a>.</p>
<p>There's a single parquet file combining all stackexchange sites. The threads
have been filtered as follows: only threads with an accepted answer, for which
both the question and response is less than 1000 characters have been choosen.
Other answers, or questions without accepted answers, or long entries have been
droppped.</p>
<p>Each row consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>INSTRUCTION</li>
<li>RESPONSE</li>
<li>SOURCE («stackexchange-ai«)</li>
<li>METADATA (tags, question_score, answer_score).</li>
</ul>
