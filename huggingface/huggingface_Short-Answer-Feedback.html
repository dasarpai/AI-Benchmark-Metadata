Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.&quot;:52,&quot;Slow start: ss_thresh is constant, increment cwnd by one every time a segment is acknowledged until ss_tresh is reached, then slowed increase of cwnd Congestion Avoidance: cwnd is reset to 1 after adjusting ss_tresh = cwnd / 2&quot;:69,&quot;Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds&quot;:49,&quot;Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.&quot;:111,&quot;Piggybacking only makes sense if there is a full-duplex or semi-duplex connection between sender and receiver i.e.  two-way communication or Frames must contain additional field for acknowledgement.&quot;:64,&quot;1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ACK, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ACK, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors.

This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic.\n3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. \n4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented.\nii)less congestion.\niii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.&quot;:55,&quot;Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nMain advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.&quot;:52,&quot;Asynchronous transmission: Every character a self-contained unit surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit, which is an easy and cheap pattern, but causes low transmission rates.\n\nSynchronous transmission: Several characters pooled to a continuous stream of data (frames), Frames defined by SYN or flag, higher complexity, but higher transmission rates. Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.&quot;:63,&quot;Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel.\nAdvantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage.\nDisadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames&quot;:64,&quot;Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).&quot;:60,&quot;The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used in Internet Protocol (IP) networks, whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network. Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment.

This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.&quot;:72,&quot;Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.&quot;:51,&quot;if the receiver is not capable of differentiating between valid and duplicated packets it may act on the same information twice.&quot;:76,&quot;0.5 P for a sensible choice out of: Token Ring, p-persistent or non-persistent CSMA, CSMA/CD or TDMA with reservation 1P for the drawback and 1P for an advantage.The following properties may be considered: Scalability, waiting time, extendability, cost effectiveness, constraints, hardware requirements, compatibility, throughput, overhead, complexity and prioritization capabilities&quot;:90,&quot;1. to use temporarily valid TSAPs -method: -TSAP valid for one connection only -generate always new TSAPs -evaluation -in general not always applicable:-process server addressing method not possible, because -server is reached via　a designated/known TSAP - some TSAPs always exist as \&quot;well-known\&quot; 2. to identify connections individually -method: -each individual connection is assigned a new SeqNo and -endsystems remember already assigned SeqNo -evaluation -endsystems must be capable of storing this information -prerequisite: -connection oriented system (what if connection-less?) -endsystems, however, will be switched off and it is necessary that the information is reliably available whenever needed 3. to identify PDUs individually: individual sequential numbers for each PDU -method: -SeqNo basically never gets reset -e.g. 48 bit at 1000 msg/sec: reiteration after 8000 years -evaluation -higher usage of bandwidth and memory -sensible choice of the sequential number range depends on -the packet rate -a packet's probable \&quot;lifetime\&quot; within the network&quot;:78,&quot;Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)&quot;:63,&quot;Possible Differences :\nThe UPD header (8 bytes) is much shorter than the TCP header (20-60 bytes)\nThe UDP header has a fixed length while the TCP header has a variable length\nFields contained in the TCP header and not the UDP header :\n-Sequence number\n-Acknowledgment number\n-Reserved\n-Flags/Control bits\n-Advertised window\n-Urgent Pointer\n-Options + Padding if the options are\nUDP includes the packet length (data + header) while TCP has the header length/data offset (just header) field instead\nThe sender port field is optional in UDP, while the source port in TCP is necessary to establish the connection&quot;:55}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;provided_answer&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;provided_answer&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;string_text&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;min&quot;:7,&quot;max&quot;:2475,&quot;mean&quot;:421.79176,&quot;median&quot;:353,&quot;std&quot;:307.55256,&quot;histogram&quot;:{&quot;hist&quot;:[550,635,306,114,53,21,14,3,2,2],&quot;bin_edges&quot;:[7,254,501,748,995,1242,1489,1736,1983,2230,2475]}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;answer_feedback&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;answer_feedback&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;string_text&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;min&quot;:7,&quot;max&quot;:602,&quot;mean&quot;:109.01235,&quot;median&quot;:82,&quot;std&quot;:95.08051,&quot;histogram&quot;:{&quot;hist&quot;:[619,533,221,166,77,46,27,7,3,1],&quot;bin_edges&quot;:[7,67,127,187,247,307,367,427,487,547,602]}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;verification_feedback&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;verification_feedback&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;string_label&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;no_label_count&quot;:0,&quot;no_label_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;n_unique&quot;:3,&quot;frequencies&quot;:{&quot;Incorrect&quot;:82,&quot;Partially correct&quot;:565,&quot;Correct&quot;:1053}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;score&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;right&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;float64&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;score&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;float&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;min&quot;:0,&quot;max&quot;:3.5,&quot;mean&quot;:1.05873,&quot;median&quot;:1,&quot;std&quot;:0.7446,&quot;histogram&quot;:{&quot;hist&quot;:[146,287,959,5,84,16,1,130,15,57],&quot;bin_edges&quot;:[0,0.35,0.7,1.05,1.4,1.75,2.1,2.45,2.8,3.15,3.5]}}}}],&quot;rows&quot;:[{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:0,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;6a31b925382d4e31a417cc78399dbff2&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is \&quot;frame bursting\&quot;?

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

If the route is correct, in that case the packet is accepted and then forwarded to all other edges. If not then then packet is discarded as it might be a duplicate packet. Reverse Path Broadcast: When a packet is unicasted to a particular station the other other station listen to check if that is the best route to the packet forwarding for the receiver station or not. If that is the best route then when a packet arrives at a station then it is also send to this edge. If that is not the best route then the packet is rejected and not sent on that path.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

P-persistent CSMA is defined by the p parameter, so it can also be adjusted to the specific needs and size of the company.

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.&quot;},&quot;reference_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;-Hidden Terminals: Suppose nodes A and C can’t hear each other and B can hear A and C. When A sends to B, but C wants to send to B, at this time, a collision is occurred at B.   -Exposed Terminals:Suppose node B can hear A and C, C can hear B and D, A can’t hear D. B sends to A, at the same time C wants to send to another terminal like D. But C has to wait, because B says that the channel is in use. But A is outside the radio range of C, therefore waiting is not necessary. Now, C is exposed to B.&quot;},&quot;answer_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The response correctly states and describes the challenges faced in wireless network routing.&quot;},&quot;verification_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Correct&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;efba7c8850ec421a9838ac21acfa8248&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Consider a single server queueing system with a buffer of size 10. Let us assume that 9 packets arrive per second and 10 packets are served per second on an average. Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.&quot;},&quot;reference_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;First of all we can derive all necessary values from the text: The buffer size is N=10, the arrival rate is ƛ = 9 and the service rate is μ = 10. As a next step, we can then calculate the change rate of the queue to ρ = ƛ/μ = 0.9. What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-ρ)ρ^n)/(1-ρ^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s. So we expect the system to be for about 57s in a state with less than 10 waiting packets.&quot;},&quot;answer_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The response correctly states the non-blocking time and provides a valid justification for the calculation.&quot;},&quot;verification_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Correct&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;602c8a3691e6435aa54952d13b4a26ec&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A company is planning to set up a new LAN at one of their locations and is looking for an appropriate medium access procedure.

This causes packets sent \&quot;through the tree\&quot; to arrive a) the fastest way possible and b) in e.g. flooding to reduce the network load. As in Link State Routing, each node knows the entire network topology (after it has been collected), it can easily compute a spanning tree with for example Kruskal’s algorithm if it knows which other nodes are in the multicasting group for which the spanning tree is calculated. To make this work, Link State packets need to be expanded with information on multicast groups which require the Link States to be sent frequently (to answer the multicast queries).

HOW do they work?&quot;},&quot;reference_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Both algorithms try to detect duplicate packets in broadcasts and only forward packets that are likely new and need to be forwarded. Other packets are likely duplicates and are discarded.  In Reverse Path Forwarding, each router saves which path a packet takes from a sender S in a unicast communication, considering it to be the shortest path from S. From there on, broadcast packets from S that are not coming over that path are considered to be duplicates and are discarded. Broadcast packets from S coming over that path are accepted and broadcasted to all edges except to the incoming one. One disadvantage of RPF is that the packet is resent over all edges (except the incoming one), but not forwarded only over suitable edges.  In Reverse Path Broadcast, a node also remembers the path taken from a sender S in a unicast communication. Additionally, a node also learns that if it never received a unicast packet from S to another node B, then it is likely not on the shortest path from S to B. To reduce the unnecessary packet duplication in RPF, the packet is not forwarded on all edges (except the incoming edge), but only on the edges which are in the reversed direction to source S.&quot;},&quot;answer_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The response is correct with one exception.

When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Spanning trees allows to reach all other nodes of a network with a small subset of links.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) is the prevention of loops in a network when a multicast is sent from a node. It works in the way that each node has the knowledge about which node it would use for sending a unicast packet due to unicast routing algorithms. When a multicast packet arrives at a node’s entry port, the node would forward the packet to all other nodes (except for the one where the packet arrived) only if the node would also use this very node for sending the incoming packets to its source. Otherwise, the packet is discarded because it is most likely a duplicate. The purpose of Reverse Path Broadcast is to send a broadcast over the network without the occurrence of loops.

It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2.

However, the funding is tight so they expect the channel load to be high compared to the hardware they can provide. Currently, they would like to have 20 systems sharing the channel, but it should be expandable later on.

P-persistent CSMA is a better way to balance length of waiting time to send data and probability of collisions in ALOHA and CSMA.\n\nPotential weakness: The value of p is not easy to determine, because too small value of p may causes low utilization of channel and too large value may causes high collision rate.&quot;},&quot;answer_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;But CSMA p-persistent might cause waste channel, too.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. &quot;},&quot;reference_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.&quot;},&quot;provided_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Through the whole lesson we have learned that some issues can surge if two users or more send information at the same time.With these independent intervals the system cannot assure that there won't be collisions, overflow or congestion which might affect the correct arrival of the packets (there is a risk that the information won't be correctly sent) . BUT with the CONDITION given on the lecture that this interval delta t is infinitely  small all of this problems will be avoided and there would not be any problem in the real internet traffic.&quot;},&quot;answer_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The assumption does not hold for the internet. So the stated response is incorrect as it relates to the situation when multiple users send at the same time while the question asked if a packet arrival at a node is dependent on the previous arrivals.&quot;},&quot;verification_feedback&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Incorrect&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:1700,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzA0OSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL1Nob3J0LUFuc3dlci1GZWVkYmFjay9zYWZfY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbl9uZXR3b3Jrc19lbmdsaXNoIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTI2NjQ5LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.yLimoxceevSFIFFFSaP67Pggso8tiSlDTf-oZ98Todvcx4Ak0_OECBo0IFRZpz9PFrqg4Rv90nK8hpiyLWF_Dg&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;Short-Answer-Feedback/saf_communication_networks_english&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8fc13b161f6c674b9e8ee1b0d229c23?d=retro&amp;size=100&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Short Answer Feedback Interest Group&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Short-Answer-Feedback&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:6},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508
Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds</span></div></div>

So the inverse probability saying that the system has less than 10 packets in the waiting queue is 1-0.05=0.95.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The purpose of these two algorithms is to broadcast the packets to all the nodes present while reducing the duplicates. Reverse Path Forwarding: When a packet is received at an IS from a sender,  then it is checked whether this is the correct and shortest path followed or not ie if the IS had to send the packets back will it use the same route or not. If the route is correct, in that case the packet is accepted and then forwarded to all other edges. If not then then packet is discarded as it might be a duplicate packet. Reverse Path Broadcast: When a packet is unicasted to a particular station the other other station listen to check if that is the best route to the packet forwarding for the receiver station or not. If that is the best route then when a packet arrives at a station then it is also send to this edge. If that is not the best route then the packet is rejected and not sent on that path. In this case it learns from the packets whether a node lies in the path of sending or receiving to a particular node or not if it does then it also forwards the packet to that path else it does not forward to that path.</span></div></div>

Explain:
+ If we send each frame individually, each frame must be attached with some additional field(like checksum...), these fields are not data. The receiver will throw them away anyway.
 + If we can reduce these fields as much as we can, we can increase the efficiency. And the "frame bursting " is the idea. Instead of inserting additional fields for every packet, we gather multiple packets together, and insert the additional fields into this single burst.

-Disadvantage: Very high delay. It's a very bad choice for interactive applications which requires low latency.

This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.

Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)</span></div></div>

HHHTTT occurs. That's why B is the least probable event.
Since there are more possible combinations of H and T for A or C, those events are more probable
than B. But since the combinations for seeing exactly three H's are more limited than for seeing at
least three H's, C is a lot less probable than A.
Since P[H] = 0.6, we get the probability of tails showing up with 

P[T] = 1 - P[H] = 0.4

So for event B, we get

P[HHHTTT] = 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 = 0.013824

For event C, the number of times of heads showing up follows a binomial distribution, so therefore we get with Y being the number of times
H is showing up with N = 6 total flips and k = 3 the number of times H showing up being examined:

P[Y=3] = 6!/(3!*(6-3)!) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^(6-3) = 0.27648

For event A, we have the same binomial distribution, but since we also accept H showing up more than 3 times, we add up the probabilities:

P[Y>=3] = P[Y=3] + P[Y=4] + P[Y=5] + P[Y=6] = 6!/(3!*3!)*0.6^3*(0.4)^3 + 6!/(4!*2!)*0.6^4*(0.4)^2 + 6!/(5!*1!)*0.6^5*(0.4)^1 + 0.6^6 = 0.8208

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms.

Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Possible Challenges:
1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.
2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.
3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:
i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. 
ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.
iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.
4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.
5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 
6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges

P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508
Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds</span></div></div>

What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-ρ)ρ^n)/(1-ρ^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s.

As in Link State Routing, each node knows the entire network topology (after it has been collected), it can easily compute a spanning tree with for example Kruskal’s algorithm if it knows which other nodes are in the multicasting group for which the spanning tree is calculated. To make this work, Link State packets need to be expanded with information on multicast groups which require the Link States to be sent frequently (to answer the multicast queries).

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Both algorithms try to detect duplicate packets in broadcasts and only forward packets that are likely new and need to be forwarded. Other packets are likely duplicates and are discarded.  In Reverse Path Forwarding, each router saves which path a packet takes from a sender S in a unicast communication, considering it to be the shortest path from S. From there on, broadcast packets from S that are not coming over that path are considered to be duplicates and are discarded. Broadcast packets from S coming over that path are accepted and broadcasted to all edges except to the incoming one. One disadvantage of RPF is that the packet is resent over all edges (except the incoming one), but not forwarded only over suitable edges.  In Reverse Path Broadcast, a node also remembers the path taken from a sender S in a unicast communication. Additionally, a node also learns that if it never received a unicast packet from S to another node B, then it is likely not on the shortest path from S to B. To reduce the unnecessary packet duplication in RPF, the packet is not forwarded on all edges (except the incoming edge), but only on the edges which are in the reversed direction to source S.</span></div></div>

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds</span></div></div>

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast prevent loops in networks. Every router knows all routes to the other nodes but blocks all of them besides the shortest. If a packet now arrives at an intermediate system, it will be checked if the packet has used the shortest path so far by comparing the incoming direction with the usual direction packets with the same sender come from. In case it is the same direction it will be forwarded over every other edge besides the one where it has arrived. If it has arrived from another direction the packet will be discarded since it is most likely a duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcast uses Reverse Path Forwarding in an algorithm to send a packet to everyone with less duplicates than flooding.</span></div></div>

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast help to reduce unwanted duplication of broadcast packets. Reverse Path Forwarding works by checking the incoming edge of a broadcast packet: if it is not the edge that this IS would use for sending a packet to the broadcast source, the packet is discarded (because packets using any non-optimal path are considered duplicate). Otherwise it is sent over all edges except the incoming one. Reverse Path Broadcast works similar to RPF, but a packet is not forwarded to an adjacent node if the current IS is not part of the optimal unicast path from the adjacent node to the broadcast source.</span></div></div>

Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: 
In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) is the prevention of loops in a network when a multicast is sent from a node. It works in the way that each node has the knowledge about which node it would use for sending a unicast packet due to unicast routing algorithms. When a multicast packet arrives at a node’s entry port, the node would forward the packet to all other nodes (except for the one where the packet arrived) only if the node would also use this very node for sending the incoming packets to its source. Otherwise, the packet is discarded because it is most likely a duplicate. The purpose of Reverse Path Broadcast is to send a broadcast over the network without the occurrence of loops. It works in a similar way like RPF but here, a receiving node doesn’t forward the packet to all other nodes. A receiving node instead only forwards the packet to the node it would also send a unicast packet to.</span></div></div>

Main advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:
1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.
2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.</span></div></div>

Reason 1: It may cause waste channel (i.e. low utilization of channel) if the contention free method like polling TDMA and token ring is used, because some users in this network may don't send data often.
Reason 2:  Due to the high load of channel, the probability of collisions is high. P-persistent CSMA is a better way to balance length of waiting time to send data and probability of collisions in ALOHA and CSMA.

Potential weakness: The value of p is not easy to determine, because too small value of p may causes low utilization of channel and too large value may causes high collision rate.</span></div></div>

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.</span></div></div>

</h3>
<p>Short Answer Feedback (SAF) dataset is a short answer dataset introduced in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.587">Your Answer is Incorrect... Would you like to know why? Introducing a Bilingual Short Answer Feedback Dataset</a> (Filighera et al., ACL 2022) as a way to remedy the lack of content-focused feedback datasets. This version of the dataset contains 31 English questions covering a range of college-level communication networks topics - while the original dataset presented in the paper is comprised of an assortment of both English and German short answer questions (with reference answers). Please refer to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Short-Answer-Feedback/saf_micro_job_german">saf_micro_job_german</a> dataset to examine the German subset of the original dataset. Furthermore, a similarly constructed SAF dataset (covering the German legal domain) can be found at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Short-Answer-Feedback/saf_legal_domain_german">saf_legal_domain_german</a>.</p>

		Annotation Process
	</span>
</h3>
<p>Two graduate students who had completed the communication networks course were selected to evaluate the answers, and both of them underwent a general annotation guideline training (supervised by a Psychology doctoral student with prior work in the field of feedback). After the training, the annotators individually provided feedback to the answers following an agreed upon scoring rubric and the general annotation guideline. The individually annotated answer files were then combined into a cohesive gold standard after discussing and solving possible disagreements.</p>
