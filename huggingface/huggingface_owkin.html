The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma compared to standard clinical care on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes. This was a prospective parallel group repeated measurement randomized design. Participants were adults aged 18 to 80 years with asthma. The intervention consisted of six group sessions on the use of nutritional manipulation, yoga techniques, and journaling. Participants also received nutritional supplements: fish oil, vitamin C, and a standardized hops extract. The control group received usual care. Primary outcome measures were the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). In total, 154 patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (77 control, 77 treatment). Treatment participants showed greater improvement than controls at 6 months for the AQLQ total score (P<.001) and for three subscales, Activity (P< 0.001), Symptoms (P= .02), and Emotion (P<.001). Treatment participants also showed greater improvement than controls on three of the SF-12 subscales, Physical functioning (P=.003); Role limitations, Physical (P< .001); and Social functioning (P= 0.03), as well as in the aggregate scores for Physical and Mental health (P= .003 and .02, respectively). There was no change in PFTs in either group. A low-cost group-oriented integrative medicine intervention can lead to significant improvement in QOL in adults with asthma.

Antihypertensive efficacy and safety of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combinations have not been adequately studied in Asians. In this open-label, 12-week study in seven Asian areas, patients on monotherapy with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) but not at blood pressure (BP) goal (sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) <90 mm Hg in non-diabetics and <80 mm Hg in diabetics) were switched to losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. At 4 and 8 weeks, the therapy for patients not at goal BP was titrated to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, respectively. Data analysis included 430 patients with mean (s.d.) age 53.0 (10.1) years and 51.9% of the female gender. After 8 weeks (primary end point; titration up to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg), 73.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 69.0-77.6) of patients reached BP goal; 63.4 and 78.1% of patients reached BP goal at 4 weeks (titration up to losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg) and at 12 weeks (titration up to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg). The mean changes from baseline (95% CI) in sitting systolic BP and SiDBP at 8 weeks were -16.7 (-18.0 to -15.4) mm Hg and -12.1 (-12.9 to -11.4) mm Hg, respectively. Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences (AEs) were reported in 27.5 and 21.0% of patients, respectively. Nine patients were discontinued because of drug-related clinical AEs. Switching Asian patients currently not at BP goal with ARB or ACEI monotherapy to a losartan/HCTZ combination achieved BP goal in the majority of patients. Losartan/HCTZ combinations were generally well tolerated.

Free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) is a potent antioxidant possessing free radical-scavenging activities. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of EGb-761, a standardized extract given in capsule form, in treating TD in schizophrenia patients. Inpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia and TD (n = 157) in a mainland China Veterans Affairs psychiatric hospital were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with either EGb-761, 240 mg/d (n = 78) or a placebo (n = 79) in a double-blind manner. Primary outcome measures were (1) change from baseline in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score and (2) proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% reduction in their AIMS total score at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive performance as measured by the Continuous Performance Test-37 Version and the 3-card Stroop task. Patients were recruited for the study between December 2006 and May 2007. Of the 157 patients who were randomly assigned, 152 (96.8%) completed the study. EGb-761 treatment significantly decreased the AIMS total score in patients with TD compared to those who were given a placebo (2.13 ± 1.75 vs -0.10 ± 1.69; P < .0001), with 40 (51.3%) and 4 (5.1%) patients achieving response in the EGb-761 and placebo treatment groups, respectively. There were no between-group differences in the PANSS total score or cognitive measures from baseline to week 12. EGb-761 appears to be an effective treatment for reducing the symptoms of TD in schizophrenia patients, and improvement may be mediated through the well-known antioxidant activity of this extract. clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00672373.

GSK233705 is an inhaled, long-acting muscarinic antagonist in development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was performed to see if the addition of GSK233705 to salmeterol would provide greater bronchodilation than salmeterol or tiotropium alone in COPD. In an incomplete-block, three-period, crossover design, dually responsive patients received three of the following five treatments: GSK233705 20 μg plus salmeterol 50 μg twice-daily; GSK233705 50 μg plus salmeterol 50 μg twice-daily; salmeterol 50 μg or placebo, each twice-daily; and tiotropium 18 μg or placebo once-daily for 7 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. The primary efficacy endpoint was morning (trough) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) on Day 8, following 7 days of treatment. Secondary endpoints included pulmonary function, plethysmography, pharmacokinetics of GSK233705 and salmeterol, adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory parameters. A total of 47 patients were randomized. The mean % predicted normal postbronchodilator FEV(1) was 55% at screening. Compared with placebo (n = 24), the adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV(1) on Day 8 was 215 mL higher with GSK233705 20 μg + salmeterol (n = 23) and 203 mL higher with GSK233705 50 μg + salmeterol (n = 27), whereas with salmeterol (n = 27) and tiotropium (n = 28) the changes were 101 mL and 118 mL higher, respectively. The primary efficacy results were supported by the results from the other secondary lung function assessments. AEs were reported by similar proportions of patients across the treatment groups, with headache the most frequently reported treatment-related AE reported by one subject receiving each of GSK233705 20 μg + salmeterol, tiotropium, and placebo. No significant differences were seen in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory parameters between the groups. The addition of GSK233705 to salmeterol in partially reversible COPD patients resulted in greater bronchodilation than salmeterol or tiotropium alone and was well tolerated.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the standard drug for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Japan, whereas fondaparinux is the standard drug in Europe and the United States. Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in Japanese patients. In 2 randomized, open-label, multicenter studies, 80 Japanese patients with acute PE or DVT received either subcutaneous fondaparinux or intravenous UFH as a non-comparative reference, in a 3:1 ratio, for 5-10 days. Concomitant warfarin therapy was continued until Day 90. Multidetector-row computed tomography-based assessment showed that 57.9% and 45.9% of the patients with acute PE and acute proximal DVT had proximal DVT and PE as a complication, respectively. There was no recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. In the fondaparinux group, the respective improvement rates at the end of the initial treatment and follow-up periods were 71.4% and 86.8% for 42 patients with PE, and 57.8% and 83.3% for 46 patients with DVT; similar results were noted in the UFH group. One patient in the fondaparinux group experienced major bleeding during the initial treatment, but no such episode in the UFH group. Once-daily, subcutaneous fondaparinux is as effective and safe without monitoring as adjusted-dose intravenous UFH for the initial treatment of acute PE and DVT in Japanese patients.

Combinations of oral analgesics may offer several potential benefits compared with an individual agent. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of an extended-release, twice-daily fixed combination of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg paracetamol (DDS-06C) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain, using acute low back pain as a model. In this phase III study, 277 patients with moderate-to-severe acute low back pain were randomized to 1-2 tablets of DDS-06C or placebo every 10-12 h for 2.5 days during the double-blind phase. Following the double-blind phase, patients had the option to continue for a 2.5-day open-label phase. Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00643383) The primary end point was the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) over the 50-h double-blind phase (SPID50). Secondary end points included total pain relief score over the 50-h double-blind phase (TOTPAR50), patient's global impression of medication, and SPID over the first 4 h. A statistically significant (p = 0.038) greater decrease in pain intensity was observed in the DDS-06C group (median SPID50: -6.0) versus placebo (median SPID50: -4.0). Greater pain relief was also observed in patients randomized to DDS-06C: the median TOTPAR50 was 13.0 for the DDS-06C group and 11.0 for placebo (p = 0.026). DDS-06C demonstrated statistically significant superior efficacy compared with placebo for the majority of the other secondary end points. Overall, 38% of patients treated with DDS-06C experienced at least one adverse event; the intensity was mild-to-moderate in 81% of cases. The most commonly reported adverse events (>5% of patients receiving DDS-06C) were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and somnolence. Using acute low back pain, a model with a high degree of heterogeneity and intrinsic variability, DDS-06C was superior to placebo on measures of pain intensity and relief, and was well-tolerated.

Helicobacter pylori is associated with benign and malignant diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and increasing antibiotic resistance has made alternative treatments necessary. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new, single-capsule treatment versus the gold standard for H pylori eradication. We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 39 sites in Europe, comparing the efficacy and safety of 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline (quadruple therapy) versus 7 days of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (standard therapy) in adults with recorded H pylori infection. Patients were randomly assigned treatment according to a predetermined list independently generated by Quintiles Canada (Ville St-Laurent, QC, Canada). Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial but was powered to detect superiority. Our primary outcome was H pylori eradication, established by two negative (13)C urea breath tests at a minimum of 28 and 56 days after the end of treatment. Our assessment for non-inferiority was in the per-protocol population, with subsequent assessment for superiority in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants randomly assigned treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00669955. 12 participants were lost to follow-up and 101 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population (n=339), the lower bound of the CI for treatment with quadruple therapy was greater than the pre-established non-inferiority margin of -10% (95% CI 15·1-32·3; p<0·0001). In the intention-to-treat population (n=440), eradication rates were 80% (174 of 218 participants) in the quadruple therapy group versus 55% (123 of 222) in the standard therapy group (p<0·0001). Safety profiles for both treatments were similar; main adverse events were gastrointestinal and CNS disorders. Quadruple therapy should be considered for first-line treatment in view of the rising prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H pylori, especially since quadruple therapy provides superior eradication with similar safety and tolerability to standard therapy.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2-127, and NCT00424268 for M2-128. In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p<0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p<0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal. Roflumilast improves lung function in patients with COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium, and could become an important treatment for these patients. Nycomed.

The goal of this study was to assess the immunogenicity and antigenicity of StrataGraft skin tissue in a randomized phase I/II clinical trial for the temporary management of full-thickness skin loss. StrataGraft skin tissue consists of a dermal equivalent containing human dermal fibroblasts and a fully stratified, biologically active epidermis derived from Near-diploid Immortalized Keratinocyte S (NIKS) cells, a pathogen-free, long-lived, consistent, human keratinocyte progenitor. Traumatic skin wounds often require temporary allograft coverage to stabilize the wound bed until autografting is possible. StrataGraft and cadaveric allograft were placed side by side on 15 patients with full-thickness skin defects for 1 week before autografting. Allografts were removed from the wound bed and examined for allogeneic immune responses. Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence were used to assess tissue structure and cellular composition of allografts. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays, chromium-release assays, and development of antibodies were used to examine allogeneic responses. One week after patient exposure to allografts, there were no differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes or Langerhans cells present in StrataGraft skin substitute compared to cadaver allograft, the standard of care. Importantly, exposure to StrataGraft skin substitute did not induce the proliferation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to NIKS keratinocytes or enhance cell-mediated lysis of NIKS keratinocytes in vitro. Similarly, no evidence of antibody generation targeted to the NIKS keratinocytes was seen. These findings indicate that StrataGraft tissue is well-tolerated and not acutely immunogenic in patients with traumatic skin wounds. Notably, exposure to StrataGraft did not increase patient sensitivity toward or elicit immune responses against the NIKS keratinocytes. We envision that this novel skin tissue technology will be widely used to facilitate the healing of traumatic cutaneous wounds.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00618839).

Cervical cancer is a significant health disparity among women in Ohio Appalachia. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention for improving Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rates, to reduce cervical cancer, among women in need of screening. Women from 14 Ohio Appalachian clinics in need of a Pap test were randomized to receive either usual care or an LHA intervention over a 10-month period. The intervention consisted of two in-person visits with an LHA, two phone calls, and four postcards. Both self-report and medical record review (MRR) data (primary outcome) were analyzed. Of the 286 women, 145 and 141 were randomized to intervention and usual care arms, respectively. According to MRR, more women in the LHA arm had a Pap test by the end of the study compared with those randomized to usual care (51.1% vs. 42.0%; OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.89-2.33; P = 0.135). Results of self-report were more pronounced (71.3% vs. 54.2%; OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.22-3.61; P = 0.008). An LHA intervention showed some improvement in the receipt of Pap tests among Ohio Appalachian women in need of screening. Although biases inherent in using self-reports of screening are well known, this study also identified biases in using MRR data in clinics located in underserved areas. LHA interventions show promise for improving screening behaviors among nonadherent women from underserved populations.

Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) has gained clinical acceptance for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although single-center studies have demonstrated excellent accuracy, multicenter studies have yielded variable results. The true diagnostic accuracy of CTCA in the \&quot;real world\&quot; remains uncertain. We conducted a field evaluation comparing multidetector CTCA with invasive CA (ICA) to understand CTCA's diagnostic accuracy in a real-world setting. A multicenter cohort study of patients awaiting ICA was conducted between September 2006 and June 2009. All patients had either a low or an intermediate pretest probability for coronary artery disease and underwent CTCA and ICA within 10 days. The results of CTCA and ICA were interpreted visually by local expert observers who were blinded to all clinical data and imaging results. Using a patient-based analysis (diameter stenosis ≥50%) of 169 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 81.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.0%-89.1%), 93.3% (95% CI, 85.9%-97.5%), 91.6% (95% CI, 82.5%-96.8%), and 84.7% (95% CI, 76.0%-91.2%), respectively; the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.873. The diagnostic accuracy varied across centers (P < .001), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value ranging from 50.0% to 93.2%, 92.0% to 100%, 84.6% to 100%, and 42.9% to 94.7%, respectively. Compared with ICA, CTCA appears to have good accuracy; however, there was variability in diagnostic accuracy across centers. Factors affecting institutional variability need to be better understood before CTCA is universally adopted. Additional real-world evaluations are needed to fully understand the impact of CTCA on clinical care. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00371891.

We aimed to determine the antiviral activity and safety of a new nucleotide analogue, LB80380, in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with lamivudine-resistant virus. Sixty-five patients with lamivudine-resistant virus were randomized to receive five ascending daily doses (30, 60, 90, 150, 240 mg) of LB80380. LB80380 was given together with lamivudine for the first 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of LB80380 monotherapy. This was then followed by 24 weeks of adefovir. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, serology, liver biochemistry, and safety were monitored. The extent of the HBV DNA reduction at week 12 was dose-dependent. The mean reduction from baseline was 2.81, 3.21, 3.92, 4.16, and 4.00 log(10) copies/mL for the five ascending dose groups. The dose-proportionate effect was statistically significant (P < 0.001) with a decrease of HBV DNA levels by an average of 1.54 log(10) copies/mL for every 1-unit increase in log(10) dose of LB80380. In 93.4% of patients, HBV DNA decreased by >2 log(10) copies/mL, and 11.5% of patients had undetectable HBV DNA levels (<300 copies/mL) by week 12. HBV DNA suppression was maintained during the 24 weeks of adefovir treatment. Hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion and normalization of alanine aminotransferase were seen in 14.6% and 24.6% of patients, respectively, at week 12; 44.6% of patients experienced mild and self-limiting adverse events, none of which were attributed to the study drug. LB80380 at doses of up to 240 mg is safe, well tolerated, and effective at reducing viral load in CHB patients with lamivudine-resistant virus for a period of 12 weeks.

CF101 demonstrated a marked anti-inflammatory effect in Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and dry eye syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CF101 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. This was a phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study. Seventy five patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis were enrolled, randomized and treated with CF101 (1, 2, or 4 mg) or placebo administered orally twice daily for 12 weeks. Safety and change from base line of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and physician's global assessment (PGA) score over 12 weeks. In the 2 mg CF101-treated group, a progressive improvement in the mean change from baseline in the PASI score vs. placebo throughout the study period was observed, with a statistically significant difference on weeks 8 and 12 (P = 0.047; P = 0.031, respectively). In this group, 35.3% of the patients achieved PASI ≥ 50 response, and 23.5% of the patients achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1. CF101 was safe and well tolerated.

The combination of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). Addition of alkylating agents to lenalidomide or thalidomide results in increased response rates and deeper responses. We designed this trial to study the combination of cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (CRd) as initial therapy for MM. Fifty-three patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM was enrolled. Patients received 4-week treatment cycles consisting of lenalidomide (25 mg daily for 3 weeks), dexamethasone (40 mg weekly), and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2) weekly for 3 weeks). A partial response or better was seen in 85% of patients including 47% with a very good partial response or better. The toxicities were manageable with over 80% of planned doses delivered; six patients went off study for toxicity. The median progression free survival (PFS) for the entire group was 28 months (95% CI: 22.7-32.6) and the overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 87% (95% CI: 78-96). Importantly, 14 patients with high-risk MM had similar PFS and OS as the standard-risk patients (n = 39). CRd is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for upfront therapy of MM with high response rates and excellent 2-year OS, and is suitable for long-term therapy.

Although consumption of various plant sterol (PS)-enriched beverages is effective in lowering plasma cholesterol, the lipid-lowering potential of PS in a soymilk format has not been investigated thoroughly. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of PS-enriched soy beverages on plasma lipids and cholesterol kinetics, we conducted two separate 28 d dietary controlled cross-over studies. In study 1, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a low-fat (2 g/serving) PS enriched soy beverage was examined in 33 normal cholesterolemic subjects in comparison with 1% dairy milk. In study 2, we investigated the efficacy of a moderate-fat (3.5 g/serving) PS-enriched soy beverage on plasma cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol kinetic responses in 23 hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with 1% dairy milk. Both the low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk varieties provided 1.95 g PS/d. Endpoint plasma variables were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using baseline values as covariates for plasma lipid measurements. In comparison with the 1% dairy milk control, the low-fat soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) total and LDL-cholesterol by 10 and 13%, respectively. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) plasma total and LDL-cholesterol by 12 and 15% respectively. Fasting triglycerides were reduced by 9.4% following consumption of the moderate-fat soy beverage in comparison with the 1% dairy milk. Both low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy varieties reduced (P < 0.05) LDL:HDL and TC:HDL ratios compared with the 1% dairy milk control. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk reduced (P < 0.05) cholesterol absorption by 27%, but did not alter cholesterol synthesis in comparison with 1% dairy milk. We conclude that, compared to 1% dairy milk, consumption of low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverages represents an effective dietary strategy to reduce circulating lipid concentrations in normal to hypercholesterolemic individuals by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) with propofol-remifentanil (PR) is associated with rapid sedation and recovery, but it is associated with a greater requirement for airway rescue than PCS with midazolam-fentanyl. To demonstrate that respiratory depression associated with PR is more frequent during anesthesiologist-administered sedation (AAS) than during PCS. Prospective, randomized, open-label study. Academic medical center. Fifty patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. PCS or AAS using PR. All patients breathed 100% oxygen via an anesthesia mask with continuous spirometry and bispectral index (BIS). Respiratory rate and BIS. Colonoscopy was completed in all patients. No patient under PCS required airway rescue. Five patients under AAS required bag-mask ventilation to resolve Sao(2) (arterial oxygen saturation) less than 90% lasting longer than 30 seconds. The median BIS for the AAS group was 71.7 (range 61.06-82.34) and 88.1 (range 83.15-93.05) for the PCS group. Median respiratory rates were 5.97 (range 1.21-10.73) breaths per minute for AAS and 13.19 (range 9.54-16.84) for PCS. Respiratory rates less than 2 breaths per minute composed 28% of the procedure time for AAS, but only 5% for PCS. Patients under PCS had lower median predicted effect site concentrations for PR, but were able to achieve brief peak levels exceeding those with AAS. These differences were significant (P < .001).

Osteopathic physicians have used osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) to treat patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and its sequelae (eg, middle ear effusion [MEE], conductive hearing loss) for more than a century. However, few clinical trials document the efficacy of OMM, perhaps because of various challenges related to OMM clinical trials. To describe a research protocol studying the efficacy of OMM on MEE after an episode of AOM, comment on the feasibility of the protocol and statistical analysis, and report on lessons learned in the first 9 months of the study. Dual-site, prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial comparing OMM plus standard care to standard care only for MEE after an episode of AOM. Standard care comprised antibiotics and surgery. Patients were aged between 6 months and 24 months, were diagnosed as having AOM, were referred to the study by a participating pediatric provider, and had abnormal tympanogram results on entry into the study. All patients had 5 weekly study visits, and patients in the intervention group received OMM on visits 1 through 3. Patients received weekly tympanogram and acoustic reflectometer readings as well as daily at-home acoustic reflectometer readings for 30 days. Fifty-six patients were screened, 34 subjects were enrolled, and 26 subjects completed the study protocol in the first 9 months of the study. This resulted in 22 \&quot;ears\&quot; in the standard card only group and 18 \&quot;ears\&quot; in the standard care plus OMM group, resulting in 40 cases of AOM studied in the first year of the trial. The OMM treatment protocol was easily administered without serious adverse events. Protocols for interpretation of tympanogram readings and conversion of data for statistical analysis resulted in analyzable data. The OMM protocol can be administered with no serious adverse events. Subject recruitment is difficult, and a full-time research assistant at the referring site improves subject referral, enrollment and retention. Accepting only confirmed cases of AOM from trained pediatric providers reduces the patient pool but increases the reliability of the data. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00520039).

To compare the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy of memantine plus rivastigmine patch with rivastigmine patch monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, patients entered an 8-week run-in period (a 5 cm 2 rivastigmine patch for 4 weeks, then a 10 cm(2) patch for 4 weeks) followed by 16 weeks of memantine plus rivastigmine patch or rivastigmine patch monotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the retention rate at the end of the trial. clinicaltrials.gov. NCT01025466. Overall, 88 and 84 patients received rivastigmine patch with and without memantine, respectively, and of these, 77 (87.5%) and 70 (83.3%) patients completed the study. The difference in retention rate was not significant (95% confidence interval: -6.3-14.7%). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) (53.4 vs. 50.6%) and discontinuation due to AEs (6.8 vs. 4.8%) were not different between patients with and without memantine. The most frequent AEs were skin irritation in patients with and without memantine (42.0 vs. 34.9%, p = 0.71), but discontinuation due to skin irritation was rare (4.5 vs. 2.4%, p = 0.74). The incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was very low in patients with and without memantine (nausea, 2.3 vs. 1.2%; vomiting, 1.1 vs. 1.2%). The Korean Version of the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores favored rivastigmine patch monotherapy at the end of treatment (p = 0.01). Changes in other efficacy measures were similar between the groups. There were no significant differences in tolerability and safety between the treatment groups. The combination therapy of memantine plus rivastigmine patch did not show an advantage over rivastigmine patch monotherapy on efficacy analyses. The sample size for comparing tolerability may have been too small to detect a difference of efficacy between the two groups.

Injectable formulations of diclofenac have long been available in Europe and other countries. These formulations use a default dose of 75 mg of diclofenac delivered IV over 30 to 120 minutes or as an IM injection. A novel formulation of injectable diclofenac sodium, Dyloject®, is solubilized with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) so that it can be given IV or IM in a small volume bolus. In this multicenter, multiple-dose, multiple-day, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study, we investigated whether lower doses of HPβCD diclofenac delivered as a small volume bolus would be effective for the management of acute pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery. Adults with moderate and severe pain, defined as ≥50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, within 6 hours after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive HPβCD diclofenac, 18.75 mg or 37.5 mg; ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg; or placebo. Patients in all treatment arms received a bolus IV injection every 6 hours until discharged. They were observed for at least 48 h, and for up to 5 days. Rescue IV morphine was available any time, up to a total of 7.5 mg over a 3-hour period. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of pain intensity differences from 0 to 48 hours after study drug initiation. Three hundred thirty-one patients received ≥1 dose of study drug. Over the first 48 hours, both IV HPβCD diclofenac doses, as well as ketorolac, produced significant reductions in pain intensity over placebo (all P < 0.05), as well as significant reductions in the need for rescue morphine administration. Both doses of HPβCD diclofenac, as well as ketorolac, significantly reduced rescue morphine dosages, as compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), and time to rescue morphine administration was significantly increased by treatment with 18.75 mg diclofenac and ketorolac. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 20.2%. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either diclofenac dose group, whereas only 1 was reported in the ketorolac group. For patients with acute moderate and severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery, repeated 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg doses of HPβCD diclofenac provided significant analgesic efficacy, as compared to placebo. Significant analgesic efficacy was also provided by the active comparator ketorolac. Both HPβCD diclofenac and ketorolac significantly reduced the need for opioids.

Anticonvulsants are regarded as useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and occurrence of side effects of lamotrigine (LTG) in comparison with carbamazepine (CBZ), in trigeminal neuralgia (TN) patients. The study was an interventional and crossover comparison. Twenty-one patients with TN were administered with LTG in comparison to CBZ. The clinical trials comprised two phases of 40 days each, with an intervening three-day washout period. The final titration in dose for LTG was 400 mg and 1,200 mg for CBZ. Efficacy of the medications involved was determined by visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS). Side effects were recorded through marking of the profiles of side effects encountered on administration of LTG and CBZ, together with baseline haematological, hepatic and renal investigations. Both on VAS and VRS assessments, in terms of proportion of patients, CBZ benefitted 90.5% (19/21) of the patients with pain relief (p < 0.05), in contrast to 62% (13/21) from LTG. On VAS assessment, of the 13 patients who gained pain relief from LTG and 19 from CBZ, 77% (10/13) obtained a \&quot;complete\&quot; degree of pain relief from LTG, as compared with 21% (4/19) from CBZ. On VRS assessment, with LTG, 84% (11/13) of the patients accomplished \&quot;much better\&quot; degree of pain relief, as compared with 26% (5/19) with CBZ. On LTG, 67% (14/21) of patients endured general pharmacological side effects, as compared with 57% (12/21) of patients on CBZ (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, LTG inflicted 14% (3/21) of the patients with haematological, hepatic and renal derangements, as compared with 48% (10/21) on CBZ. LTG is generally an effective and safe treatment for management of TN, compared to CBZ.

The development of novel artemisinin-combination therapies suitable for the treatment of pediatric patients suffering from malaria is a research priority. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate combination for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Gabonese patients 2-14 years old. The study was designed as an open-label dose-escalation study recruiting 60 pediatric patients sequentially in 4 treatment cohorts: study drugs were administered once daily for 3 days, as tablet coformulations (pyronaridine:artesunate ratios of 6:2, 9:3, and 12:4 mg/kg) and as a granule coformulation (pyronaridine:artesunate ratio of 9:3 mg/kg). The primary end points were tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of pyronaridine-artesunate treatment. Efficacy was treated as a secondary outcome measure. The drugs had a good tolerability and safety profile, at all dose levels. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the maximum plasma/blood concentration and the area under the curve, as well as comparable relative bioavailability for the granule coformulation. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates at day 28 were 100% in per-protocol analysis, at all dose levels. Pyronaridine-artesunate is a promising novel artemisinin-combination therapy for pediatric patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and the development of both the tablet and the granule coformulations is warranted.

Fixed combinations of 0.2% brimonidine-0.5% timolol and 2% dorzolamide-0.5% timolol are used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the IOP-lowering efficacy and ocular tolerability of brimonidine-timolol compared with dorzolamide-timolol when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to a prostaglandin analog (PGA) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Pooled data analysis of two randomized, investigator-masked, 3-month, parallel-group studies with identical protocols (ten sites). In all, 180 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were in need of lower IOP received topical brimonidine-timolol BID or dorzolamide-timolol BID as monotherapy (n = 101) or as adjunctive therapy to a PGA (latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost) (n = 79). The studies are registered with the identifiers NCT00822081 and NCT00822055 at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. IOP was measured at 10 a.m. (peak effect) at baseline and at months 1 and 3. Tolerability/comfort was evaluated using a patient questionnaire. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in patient demographics. Most patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 68 years. There were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in baseline IOP. At month 3, the mean (SD) reduction from baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination monotherapy was 7.7 (4.2) mmHg (32.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 6.7 (5.0) mmHg (26.1%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.040). The mean reduction from PGA-treated baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination adjunctive therapy was 6.9 (4.8) mmHg (29.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 5.2 (3.7) mmHg (23.5%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.213). Patients on brimonidine-timolol reported less burning (p < 0.001), stinging (p < 0.001), and unusual taste (p < 0.001) than patients on dorzolamide-timolol. Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol provided the same or greater IOP lowering compared with fixed-combination dorzolamide-timolol. Both fixed-combination medications were safe and well-tolerated. Brimonidine-timolol received higher ratings of ocular comfort than dorzolamide-timolol. The duration of the studies was 3 months, and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine-timolol and dorzolamide-timolol during long-term treatment.

Some 50% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) worldwide live in the Indian state of Bihar. Liposomal amphotericin B is an effective treatment when administered in short courses. We wanted to determine whether the efficacy of a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was inferior to conventional parenteral therapy, consisting of 15 alternate-day infusions of amphotericin B deoxycholate. In this open-label study, we randomly assigned 412 patients in a 3:1 ratio to receive either liposomal amphotericin B (liposomal-therapy group) or amphotericin B deoxycholate (conventional-therapy group). Liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given once, and patients were discharged home 24 hours later. Amphotericin B deoxycholate, which was administered in 15 infusions of 1 mg per kilogram, was given every other day during a 29-day hospitalization. We determined the cure rate 6 months after treatment. A total of 410 patients--304 of 304 patients (100%) in the liposomal-therapy group and 106 of 108 patients (98%) in the conventional-therapy group--had apparent cure responses at day 30. Cure rates at 6 months were similar in the two groups: 95.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.4 to 97.9) in the liposomal-therapy group and 96.3% (95% CI, 92.6 to 99.9) in the conventional-therapy group. Adverse events in the liposomal-therapy group were infusion-related fever or rigors (in 40%) and increased anemia or thrombocytopenia (in 2%); such events in the conventional-therapy group were fever or rigors (in 64%), increased anemia (in 19%), and hypokalemia (in 2%). Nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity developed in no more than 1% of patients in each group. A single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was not inferior to and was less expensive than conventional therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00628719.)

The current standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 is once-weekly pegylated interferon-α (Peg-IFNα) plus daily ribavirin for 48 weeks. We evaluated the efficacy/safety of albinterferon alfa-2b (albIFN), a novel, long-acting, genetic fusion polypeptide of albumin and IFNα-2b. In the phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 trial, 1331 patients were assigned equally to 3 open-label, 48-week treatment groups: Peg-IFNα-2a 180 μg every week, or albIFN 900 or 1200 μg every 2 weeks administered subcutaneously, with weight-based oral ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. During the study, the data monitoring committee recommended dose modification for all patients receiving albIFN 1200 μg to 900 μg because of increased pulmonary adverse events (AEs) in the 1200-μg arms of both ACHIEVE studies. Main outcome measure was sustained virologic response (SVR; undetectable serum HCV RNA at week 72). Intention-to-treat SVR rates were 51.0% (225/441), 48.2% (213/442), and 47.3% (208/440) with Peg-IFNα-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1200 μg, respectively. The primary objective of showing noninferiority of albIFN 900 μg (P < .001) and 1200 μg (P = .003) vs Peg-IFNα-2a for SVR was achieved. Multivariate modeling indicated consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Serious/severe AE rates were 23.1%, 24.0%, 28.2%; treatment discontinuation rates because of AEs were 4.1%, 10.4%, 10.0%; discontinuation rates because of respiratory AEs were 0%, 0.9%, 1.6%; with Peg-IFNα-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1200 μg, respectively. Hematologic abnormality rates were comparable across the Peg-IFNα-2a and albIFN 900-μg groups. albIFN 900 μg every 2 weeks showed comparable efficacy, with similar serious/severe AE rates, although with a higher discontinuation rate, vs Peg-IFNα-2a in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1.

To demonstrate the benefit of the combination amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg over amlodipine 10 mg, in producing a lower incidence of peripheral oedema for a comparable mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) reduction. After a 4-week amlodipine 5 mg run-in phase, inadequately controlled hypertension patients (aged > or = 55 years, MSSBP > or = 130 and < or = 160 mmHg) were randomised to receive amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg or amlodipine 10 mg for 8 weeks, followed by amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg for 4 weeks for all patients. Primary variables were MSSBP change from baseline to week 8 and incidence of peripheral oedema reported as an AE. Resolution of peripheral oedema was assessed 4 weeks after switching patients from amlodipine 10 mg to amlodipine/ valsartan 5/160 mg. At week 8, MSSBP showed greater reduction with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg than amlodipine 10 mg (least square mean: -8.01 vs.-5.95 mmHg, p < 0.001 for non-inferiority and p = 0.002 for superiority). Systolic control, overall BP control and systolic response rate at week 8 were significantly higher with combination than amlodipine 10 mg (34 vs. 26%; 57 vs. 50%; 36.57 vs. 27.77%, respectively). Incidence of peripheral oedema was significantly lower with the combination than amlodipine 10 mg (6.6 vs. 31.1%, p < 0.001). Peripheral oedema resolved in 56% patients who switched from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination, without the loss of effect on BP reduction. In non-responders to amlodipine 5 mg, treatment with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg induced significantly less peripheral oedema than amlodipine 10 mg for similar BP reduction. Peripheral oedema resolved in > 50% patients switching from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination.

Preventive electronic (e)-counselling has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. However, heterogeneity in outcomes is commonly reported due to differences in e-protocols. We incorporated key features of an established behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, to help standardize e-counselling in order to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Subjects (n = 387, mean age = 56 years, 59% female, 72% taking ≥ 1 antihypertensive drug) were diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 hypertension. Subjects were randomized to a 4-month protocol of e-counselling (beta version of the \&quot;Blood Pressure Action Plan\&quot;, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada) vs waitlist control (general e-information on heart-healthy living). Outcomes were systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, and total lipoprotein cholesterol after treatment. Intention to treat analysis did not find a significant group difference in outcomes due to contamination across the 2 arms of this trial. However, per protocol analysis indicated that subjects receiving ≥ 8 e-counselling messages (a priori therapeutic dose) vs 0 e-counselling messages (control) demonstrated greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean, -8.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.5 to -6.4 vs -5.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.7 to -3.3, P = 0.03), pulse pressure (-6.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.1 to -4.1 vs -3.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.3 to -1.8, P = 0.02) and total cholesterol (-0.24 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.06 vs 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.16, P = 0.03), but not diastolic blood pressure. These findings support the merit of evaluating whether e-counselling can improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular risk over the long-term.

We conducted an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial involving three sites in Sri Lanka that enrolled a total of 216 patients without established CVD. The trial compared a Polypill (75 mg aspirin, 20 mg simvastatin, 10 mg lisinopril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) to Standard Practice. After randomization, patients were followed monthly for three months. Pre-specified primary outcomes included reduction in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and estimated 10-year CVD risk. We also evaluated the recruitment process and acceptability of the Polypill by both physicians and patients. Patients were recruited in a six-month period as planned. Two hundred three patients (94.0%) completed the treatment program and returned for their three-month follow-up visits. No safety concerns were reported. These findings suggest a high rate of patient acceptability, a finding that is bolstered by the majority of patients completing the trial (90%) indicating that they would take the Polypill \&quot;for life\&quot; if proven to be effective in reducing CVD risk. Approximately 86% of the physicians surveyed agreed with and supported use of the Polypill for primary prevention and 93% for secondary prevention of CVD. Both the Polypill and Standard Practice resulted in marked reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and 10-year risk of CVD. However, the differences between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. We successfully completed a Polypill feasibility trial in Sri Lanka. We were able to document high acceptability of the Polypill to patients and physicians. We were unable to estimate the risk factor reductions on the Polypill because the control group received similar treatment with individual drugs. The Polypill was however simpler and achieved comparable risk factor reductions, highlighting its potential usefulness in the prevention of CVD. NCT00567307.

Recent evidence implicates the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor as a major cause of radiculopathy. Yet, whereas open-label studies with systemically delivered tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have yielded positive results, a placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate efficacy. One variable that may have contributed to poor outcomes is low drug levels at the site of nerve inflammation. To date, no studies have evaluated the efficacy or safety of epidurally administered anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study was conducted to evaluate an epidural tumor necrosis factor inhibitor. Twenty-four patients with subacute lumbosacral radiculopathy were randomly assigned to receive two transforaminal epidural injections of 2, 4, or 6 mg of entanercept 2 weeks apart in successive groups of eight. In each group, two patients received epidural saline. A parallel epidural canine safety study was conducted using the same injection doses and paradigm as in the clinical study. The animal and human safety studies revealed no behavioral, neurologic, or histologic evidence of drug-related toxicity. In the clinical arm, significant improvements in leg and back pain were collectively noted for the etanercept-treated patients, but not for the saline group, one month after treatment. One patient in the saline group (17%), six patients in the 2-mg group (100%), and four patients each in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups (67%) reported at least 50% reduction in leg pain and a positive global perceived effect one month after treatment. Six months after treatment, the beneficial effects persisted in all but one patient. Epidural entanercept holds promise as a treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Chronic inflammation is considered to play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Various (n-3) fatty acids (FA) have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects, but there is a lack of consensus in this area, particularly in regard to optimal source(s) and dose(s). This study aimed to determine the effects of high and low doses of (n-3) FA from plant and marine sources on plasma inflammatory marker concentrations. One-hundred adults with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a low or high dose of plant- (2.2 or 6.6 g/d α-linolenic acid) or marine- (1.2 or 3.6 g/d EPA and DHA) derived (n-3) FA or placebo for 8 wk, using a parallel arm design (n = 20/arm). Fasting blood samples collected at 0, 4, and 8 wk were analyzed for concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and for cardiovascular risk factors. Baseline concentrations across all 5 groups combined were (mean ± SD) 103 ± 32 ng/L for MCP-1, 1.06 ± 0.56 ng/L for IL-6, and 0.197 ± 0.041 ng/L for sICAM-1. There were no significant differences in 8-wk changes in plasma inflammatory marker concentrations among the 5 groups. Plasma TG and blood pressure decreased significantly more and the LDL cholesterol concentration increased more in the high-dose fish oil group compared to the 8-wk changes in some of the other 4 groups (P ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, no beneficial effects were detected for any of the 3 inflammatory markers investigated in response to (n-3) FA in adults with metabolic syndrome regardless of dose or source.

IXIARO (IC51), a recently approved inactivated Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, is immunogenic and safe in a 0/28 days primary immunization schedule. Neutralizing antibody titers decline with time and booster doses are likely needed to enhance persistence of immunity. To assess the effect of a booster dose on neutralizing JE antibody titers for up to 12 months after boostering. In this phase III trial, 198 subjects, who had received primary immunization in a preceding randomized trial, were boosted with IXIARO 15 months after the primary immunization. Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed by plaque-reduction neutralisation test, PRNT. Prior to the booster dose, 69.2% (137/198) of subjects had PRNT50 titers ≥ 1:10. One month after the booster, the rate of subjects with PRNT50 ≥ 1:10 (recognized as a protective titer) was 100%. This rate remained high at 98.5% at 6 and 12 months; GMTs were 22.5 before the booster and 900, 487 and 361 at 1, 6 and 12 months after the booster, respectively. A booster dose of IXIARO at 15 months after primary immunization was highly immunogenic with GMTs >5-fold higher than those seen immediately after primary immunization, and remained at high levels for at least 12 months after the booster.

To determine functionality and acceptability of a new teriparatide (Forteo, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) delivery device by patients with osteoporosis. This was an eight week, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial. Patients received teriparatide 20 microg/day by subcutaneous injection using a new delivery device. Men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture were stratified to Current User (n = 92) or Not Current User (n = 107) groups. Current Users had used the original delivery device for > or =8 weeks, including uninterrupted use for four weeks before enrollment. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00577863. The primary objective was to detect common complaints (> or =3% for all patients) regarding the functionality and acceptability of the new device. Complaints were categorized as functional (e.g., malfunction), nonfunctional (e.g., size), or user manual. Secondary objectives included questionnaire assessment of preference of the new versus original device, features of the new delivery device, and analysis of adverse events. A total of 31 patients (16%) reported 47 complaints (four functional, 27 nonfunctional, and 16 user manual). There were two common complaints: device size (4.0%) and lack of information on alcohol swabs (3.5%). Overall, patients agreed that the new device was easy to use (99.5%), easy to learn to use (99%), easy to attach a needle (97%), easy to hold while injecting (95%), and that it reduced their reluctance to take injections (90%). Most Current Users (92%) preferred the new delivery device over the original device. Adverse events reported by > or =2% of patients were upper respiratory infection (3.5%), urinary tract infection (2%), influenza (2%), and headache (2%). Limitations include the one-arm study design and the short (eight week) duration of the study. Patients found the new teriparatide delivery device easy to use and Current Users preferred the new delivery device over the original device.

The ideal anticoagulant should prevent ischemic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding. Controlled anticoagulation is possible with the REG1 system, an RNA aptamer pair comprising the direct factor IXa inhibitor RB006 and its active control agent RB007. This phase 2a study included a roll-in group (n=2) treated with REG1 plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors followed by 2 groups randomized 5:1 to REG1 or unfractionated heparin. In group 1 (n=12), RB006 was partially reversed with RB007 after percutaneous coronary intervention and fully reversed 4 hours later. In group 2 (n=12), RB006 was fully reversed with RB007 immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention. Femoral sheaths were removed after complete reversal. Patients were pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel. End points included major bleeding within 48 hours; composite of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization within 14 days; and pharmacodynamic measures. All cases were successful, with final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow and no angiographic thrombotic complications. There were 2 ischemic end points in the REG1 group and 1 in the unfractionated heparin group, with 1 major bleed in the unfractionated heparin group. Median activated clotting time values rose from 151 to 236 seconds after RB006. Administration of the partial RB007 dose reversed anticoagulation to an intermediate activated clotting time value of 186 seconds. Complete reversal with RB007 returned the median activated clotting time value to 144 seconds. Both reversal strategies enabled scheduled femoral sheath removal. This study demonstrates the clinical translation of a novel platform of anticoagulation targeting factor IXa and its active reversal to percutaneous coronary intervention and provides the basis for further investigation.

This study (NCT00383123) compared the immunogenicity and safety of 2 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines: Fluarix [GlaxoSmithKline (study vaccine)] and Fluzone [Sanofi Pasteur (control vaccine)] in children 6 months to <18 years. Children, stratified by age and randomized, received either study (N = 2115) or control vaccine (N = 1210) at day 0 (and day 28 for previously unvaccinated children younger than 9 years). Children 6 months to <5 years comprised the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity, whereas the reactogenicity/safety group included all children 6 months to <18 years. The study aimed to demonstrate immunologic noninferiority of study vaccine versus control vaccine. For children 6 months to <5 years, the predefined noninferiority criteria were not reached, mainly due to the differences in immune response in children 6 months to <3 years with no influenza vaccination history. All reactogenicity/safety endpoints were within the same range in both vaccine groups. The study vaccine demonstrated a good safety and reactogenicity profile; however, it did not meet the predefined noninferiority criteria in children 6 months to <5 years.

The anti-interleukin-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody briakinumab has been shown in a phase II study to be effective psoriasis treatment. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of briakinumab compared with etanercept and placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In this phase III, 12-week study (M10-114, NCT00691964), 347 patients were randomized in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio to receive 200 mg briakinumab at weeks 0 and 4 followed by 100 mg briakinumab at week 8 (n = 138); 50 mg of etanercept twice weekly 3-4 days apart at weeks 0-11 (n = 141); or placebo injections matching active treatment (n = 68). The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0/1 at week 12, and the proportion of patients achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at week 12. Of the briakinumab-treated patients, 71·0% achieved a PGA of 0/1 at week 12 as compared with 39·7% of etanercept-treated patients and 2·9% of placebo-treated patients, (P < 0·001, for both comparisons). Of the briakinumab-treated patients 81·9% achieved a PASI 75 response at week 12 as compared with 56·0% of etanercept-treated and 7·4% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0·001, for both comparisons). Serious adverse event rates were reported in four (2·9%) patients receiving briakinumab, one (0·7%) patient receiving etanercept and one (1·5%) placebo-treated patient. In patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, briakinumab had superior efficacy to both placebo and etanercept at 12 weeks as administered in this study.

Vitamin E has been studied extensively in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Cross-sectional population studies as well as randomized controlled intervention trials have demonstrated conflicting results. A recent meta-analysis of these trials has emphasized the ineffectiveness of vitamin E in atherosclerosis prevention, with a possibility of harm at higher dosages. However, vitamin E has several isomers, with the alpha form being available via dietary supplements and the gamma form being available via dietary foodstuffs. The gamma form of vitamin E demonstrates several superior properties (such as trapping reactive nitrogen species and detoxifying nitrogen dioxide) compared with alpha vitamin E. All clinical trials have used the alpha isomer, with little concern that this isomer of vitamin E may actually suppress the gamma isomer of vitamin E. We undertook a dose-response study in volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus to include all the dosages of alpha vitamin E that have been used in cardiovascular prevention trials to determine the effect of alpha vitamin E on gamma vitamin E. We also assessed the effect of alpha vitamin E on several traditional markers of atherosclerotic risk. We added vitamin C to the vitamin E because several clinical trials included this vitamin to enhance the antioxidant effects of alpha vitamin E. Volunteers received, in randomized order for a 2-week period, one of the following vitamin dosage arms: (1) no vitamins, (2) low-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, (3) medium-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, and (4) high-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C. Blood levels of both alpha and gamma vitamin E were measured as well as surrogate markers of oxidative stress, hypercoagulation, and inflammation during a high-fat atherogenic meal (to increase the ambient oxidative stress level during the study). The results demonstrate that alpha vitamin E levels increased in proportion to the dose administered. However, at every dose of alpha vitamin E, gamma vitamin E concentration was significantly suppressed. No beneficial changes in surrogate markers of atherosclerosis were observed, consistent with the negative results of prospective clinical trials using alpha vitamin E. Our results suggest that all prospective cardiovascular clinical trials that used vitamin E supplementation actually suppressed the beneficial antioxidant gamma isomer of vitamin E. No beneficial effects on several potential cardiovascular risk factors were observed, even when the vitamin E was supplemented with vitamin C. If a standardized preparation of gamma vitamin E (without the alpha isomer) becomes available, the effects of gamma vitamin E on atherosclerotic risk will warrant additional studies.

Production of leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) has been linked to unstable atherosclerotic plaques and cardiovascular events. VIA-2291 is a potent 5-LO inhibitor. In a double-blinded study, 191 patients were randomly assigned 3 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome to receive 25, 50, or 100 mg VIA-2291 or placebo daily for 12 weeks. The primary study end point, whole blood stimulated leukotriene LTB4 at trough drug level, was reduced in all VIA-2291 groups (P<0.0001) in a dose-dependent fashion, with approximately 80% inhibition in >90% of patients in the 100-mg group. A significant reduction of urine leukotriene LTE4 was obtained in all dose groups. No serious adverse events were considered related to study drug. A subset of 93 patients who had undergone a 64-slice coronary CT examination at baseline continued on study medication for a total of 24 weeks and underwent a repeat scan. Five of these patients withdrew or were noncompliant and 28 had nonevaluable scans. Among the 60 remaining patients, new coronary plaques were observed in 5 of 18 (27.8%) placebo-treated patients and in 2 of 42 (4.8%) VIA-2291-treated patients (P=0.01). A reduction in noncalcified plaque volume at 24 weeks versus placebo was observed in VIA-2291-treated groups in the 34 of these 60 patients in whom this end point was analyzable (P<0.01). VIA-2291 reduces leukotriene production at 12 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome.

Previous phase 2 studies have shown antitumour activity with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in patients with advanced biliary-tract cancers (BTCs). In this phase 2 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of combined bevacizumab with GEMOX (GEMOX-B) in patients with advanced BTCs, and investigated how changes in 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET correlate with clinical outcome. Patients with advanced measurable BTCs were given the following treatment on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle: bevacizumab 10 mg/kg, followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) (10 mg/m(2) per min) and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) (2-h infusion). [(18)F]FDG-PET scans were obtained at baseline and after completion of the second cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Efficacy and safety analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00361231. 35 patients were enrolled and evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI 5.3-10.3), and PFS at 6 months was 63% (47-79), which was below the targeted rate of 70%. Grade 3-4 toxic effects included neutropenia (n=7), raised alanine aminotransferase concentrations (n=5), peripheral neuropathy (n=5), and hypertension (n=5). [(18)F]FDG-PET scans showed a significant decrease in maximum standardised uptake value (SUV(max)) after two cycles of treatment (5.72 [SD 2.01] at baseline; 3.73 [SD 1.88] after two cycles; p<0.0001). These changes were more pronounced in patients with partial response or stable disease than those with progressive disease (24 patients, -2.80 [SD 1.95] vs five patients, 1.41 [SD 3.13]; p=0.009). Change in SUV(max) was a significant predictor of PFS (HR 1.35, 1.14-1.60, p=0.0006) and overall survival (1.25, 1.05-1.50, p=0.01). GEMOX-B showed antitumour activity with tolerable safety in patients with advanced BTCs. Decreases in SUV(max) on [(18)F]FDG-PET scans after treatment were associated with disease control and increases in PFS and overall survival. Genentech Oncology and Sanofi-Aventis.

Fat intake, especially monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), has been liberalized in diabetic diets to preserve HDL cholesterol and improve glycemic control, yet the exact sources have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we assessed the effect of mixed nut consumption as a source of vegetable fat on serum lipids and HbA(1c) in type 2 diabetes. A total of 117 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomized to one of three treatments for 3 months. Supplements were provided at 475 kcal per 2,000-kcal diet as mixed nuts (75 g/day), muffins, or half portions of both. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c). The relative increase in MUFAs was 8.7% energy on the full-nut dose compared with muffins. Using an intention-to-treat analysis (n = 117), full-nut dose (mean intake 73 g/day) reduced HbA(1c) (-0.21% absolute HbA(1c) units, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11, P < 0.001) with no change after half-nut dose or muffin. Full-nut dose was significantly different from half-nut dose (P = 0.004) and muffin (P = 0.001), but no difference was seen between half-nut dose and muffins. LDL cholesterol also decreased significantly after full-nut dose compared with muffin. The LDL cholesterol reduction after half-nut dose was intermediate and not significantly different from the other treatments. Apolipoprotein (apo) B and the apoB:apoA1 ratio behaved similarly. Nut intake related negatively to changes in HbA(1c) (r = -0.20, P = 0.033) and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.24, P = 0.011). Two ounces of nuts daily as a replacement for carbohydrate foods improved both glycemic control and serum lipids in type 2 diabetes.

No prospective, randomized, double-blind trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have previously been reported in adults or children with proteinuria secondary to Alport syndrome. This 12-week, double-blind multinational study investigated the effects of losartan 0.7-1.4 mg/kg/day compared with placebo (normotensive patients) or amlodipine 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day up to 5 mg/day (hypertensive patients) on proteinuria [early morning-void urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPr/Cr), baseline ≥ 34 mg/mmol] in 30 children of up to 17 years of age with Alport syndrome. Twelve weeks of treatment with losartan significantly reduced proteinuria compared with placebo/amlodipine: losartan -14.7 mg/mmol (interquartile range -49.7 to -5.7 mg/mmol) or 31.6% reduction using a mixed model approach versus placebo/amlodipine 2.3 mg/mmol (-26.0 to 18.1 mg/mmol), P = 0.01 or 2.3% increase using a mixed model approach. Adverse event incidence was low and comparable between losartan and placebo/amlodipine groups. Losartan significantly lowered proteinuria and was well tolerated after 12 weeks of treatment in children aged 1-17 years with proteinuria secondary to Alport syndrome with or without hypertension, a population that has not previously been rigorously studied.

Assess the long-term efficacy and safety of prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (P-OM3) coadministered with simvastatin in an extension of the Combination of Prescription Omega-3 Plus Simvastatin (COMBOS) trial. COMBOS included hypertriglyceridemic patients (triglyceride [TG] >or=200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL or >or=2.26 mmol/L and <5.64 mmol/L) with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level no greater than 10% above the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III treatment goal. After an 8-week lead-in phase with simvastatin 40 mg/day (which continued throughout the trial), subjects were randomized to 8 weeks of P-OM3 4 g/day or placebo. Completers were eligible to participate in a 24-month extension study. Those who received placebo + simvastatin in COMBOS switched to open-label P-OM3 + simvastatin ('Switchers'); those who received P-OM3 + simvastatin during COMBOS continued the same regimen (open-label) in the extension phase ('Non-switchers'). The primary endpoint was the difference between Non-switchers and Switchers in median percent change in non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) from COMBOS end of treatment to Month 4 of the extension phase. At Month 4 from COMBOS end of treatment, non-HDL-C was reduced by a median of 9.4% in Switchers and increased by 0.9% in Non-switchers (p < 0.001). For the total population (combined Non-switcher + Switcher population), the median percent change from COMBOS baseline to Months 4, 12, and 24 was -8.3%, -7.3%, and -8.9%, respectively (all p < 0.001). This extension study revealed no unexpected safety findings. A limitation of this study was a gap between completion of COMBOS and enrollment in the extension phase for some patients; however, a post-hoc non-HDL-C sensitivity analysis performed at the 4-month primary endpoint revealed no influence of gap on study results. In this 24-month extension study, P-OM3 was generally well tolerated, and produced sustained reductions in non-HDL-C levels in simvastatin-treated patients with TG levels between 200 and 500 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L and 5.64 mmol/L).

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is now the leading cause of uncomplicated skin abscesses in the United States, and the role of antibiotics is controversial. We evaluate whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces the rate of treatment failures during the 7 days after incision and drainage and whether it reduces new lesion formation within 30 days. In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized adults to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo after uncomplicated abscess incision and drainage. Using emergency department rechecks at 2 and 7 days and telephone follow-up, we assessed treatment failure within 7 days, and using clinical follow-up, telephone follow-up, and medical record review, we recorded the development of new lesions within 30 days. We randomized 212 patients, and 190 (90%) were available for 7-day follow-up. We observed a statistically similar incidence of treatment failure in patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (15/88; 17%) versus placebo (27/102; 26%), difference 9%, 95% confidence interval -2% to 21%; P=.12. On 30-day follow-up (successful in 69% of patients), we observed fewer new lesions in the antibiotic (4/46; 9%) versus placebo (14/50; 28%) groups, difference 19%, 95% confidence interval 4% to 34%, P=.02. After the incision and drainage of uncomplicated abscesses in adults, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does not reduce treatment failure but may decrease the formation of subsequent lesions.

Despite the favorable results of imatinib front line in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia there is room for improvement. Early intervention during imatinib therapy was undertaken in 210 adults with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia less than three months from diagnosis (Sokal high risk: 16%). Patients received imatinib 400 mg/day. At three months, dose was increased if complete hematologic response was not achieved. At six months, patients in complete cytogenetic response were kept on 400 mg and the remainder randomized to higher imatinib dose or 400 mg plus interferon-alfa. At 18 months, randomized patients were switched to a 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor if not in complete cytogenetic response and imatinib dose increased in non-randomized patients not in major molecular response. Seventy-two percent of patients started imatinib within one month from diagnosis. Median follow-up is 50.5 (range: 1.2-78) months. At three months 4 patients did not have complete hematologic response; at six months 73.8% were in complete cytogenetic response; among the remainder, 9 could not be randomized (toxicity or consent withdrawal), 17 were assigned to high imatinib dose, and 15 to 400 mg + interferon-alpha. The low number of randomized patients precluded comparison between the two arms. Cumulative response at three years was: complete hematologic response 98.6%, complete cytogenetic response 90% and major molecular response 82%. On an intention-to-treat basis, complete cytogenetic response was 78.8% at 18 months. At five years, survival was 97.5%, survival free from accelerated/blastic phase 94.3%, failure free survival 82.5%, and event free survival (including permanent imatinib discontinuation) 71.5%.

To explore the efficacy and safety of imiquimod 5% cream as a treatment for infantile hemangioma. Phase II, open-label, noncomparative study of imiquimod applied during 16 weeks, with posttherapy follow-up 16 weeks later (8 months total). Outpatient pediatric tertiary care referral center in Quebec, Canada. Healthy infants up to 8.8 months of age with previously untreated, nonulcerated, proliferative superficial or mixed infantile hemangioma, excluding periorbital, or perineal localization, > or =100 cm2 in size. Topical imiquimod applied three to seven times per week for 16 weeks to infantile hemangioma. Lesion area, volume, depth (Doppler ultrasound), and color (erythema), serum drug, and interferon-alpha levels. Sixteen infants (11 girls, 5 boys) with a mean age at entry of 4.1 months and mean lesion area of 32.89 cm2, and volume of 39.98 cm3 were enrolled. Two participants discontinued treatment early, one for an adverse event (crying upon application), the other because of the lack of compliance. Local skin reactions were consistent with those reported in adults. Two cases had a decrease and three had an increase in lesion parameters; otherwise no meaningful changes in lesion area, volume, or depth were observed. At the 4-month posttreatment visit, 11 of 14 subjects had improvement in erythema (marginal homogeneity test = 2.668, p = 0.008). Measured serum drug and interferon-alpha levels were low or undetectable. Treatment of infants with infantile hemangioma with imiquimod up to seven times per week for 16 weeks was generally well tolerated with low systemic exposure. Improvement was observed in hemangioma coloration, but not lesion size, suggesting effects were limited to the superficial component.

Although data from studies in animals demonstrated beneficial effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy on bone, clinical trials in postmenopausal women showed conflicting results. To determine whether WBV improves bone density and structure. A 12-month, single-center, superiority, randomized, controlled trial with 3 parallel groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00420940) Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada. 202 healthy postmenopausal women with bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5 who were not receiving prescription bone medications. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (1:1:1 ratio) by using a block-randomization scheme and sealed envelopes. They were asked to stand on a low-magnitude (0.3g) 90-Hz or 30-Hz WBV platform for 20 minutes daily or to serve as control participants; all participants received calcium and vitamin D. Bone outcome assessors, who were blinded to group assignment, determined trabecular volumetric BMD and other measurements of the distal tibia and distal radius with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and areal BMD with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at 12 months. 12 months of WBV therapy had no significant effect on any bone outcomes compared with no WBV therapy. For the primary outcome of tibial trabecular volumetric BMD, mean change from baseline was 0.4 mg/cm(3) (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.2 mg/cm(3)) in the 90-Hz WBV group, -0.1 mg/cm(3) (CI, -1.0 to 0.8 mg/cm(3)) in the 30-Hz WBV group, and -0.2 mg/cm(3) (CI, -1.1 to 0.6 mg/cm(3)) in the control group (P = 0.55). Changes in areal BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine were also similar among the groups. Overall, low-magnitude WBV at both 90 and 30 Hz was well-tolerated. Adherence to WBV ranged from 65% to 79%. Double-blinding was not possible. Whole-body vibration therapy at 0.3g and 90 or 30 Hz for 12 months did not alter BMD or bone structure in postmenopausal women who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

To evaluate the effectiveness of montelukast as add-on therapy for patients diagnosed with asthma and concurrent allergic rhinitis who remain uncontrolled while receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or ICS/long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA) therapy in a community practice setting. An eight-week, multicentre, open-label, observational study. Patients were 15 years of age or older and, while treated with an ICS or ICS/LABA, had allergic rhinitis and uncontrolled asthma symptoms by at least two criteria as per the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with controlled asthma symptoms after eight weeks of treatment with montelukast 10 mg once daily added to ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. In total, 1004 patients participated in the survey phase of the study. Of these patients, 319 continued in the treatment phase and 301 (94.4%) completed the eight-week assessment. At baseline, all patients had uncontrolled asthma symptoms based on the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines; at the eight-week assessment, 229 patients (76.1%) achieved asthma control. According to the Asthma Control Questionnaire (as determined by scores of 0.75 or less), 164 patients (54.7%) achieved well-controlled asthma at week 8. The mean (+/- SD) Asthma Control Questionnaire score decreased from 2.03+/-0.80 to 0.92+/-0.80 (P<0.001) for all patients, representing a clinically significant improvement. A statistically and clinically significant reduction in the overall Mini Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score was achieved with a decrease from 2.57+/-1.20 to 1.12+/-1.00 (-1.45+/-1.35; P<0.001). Patient and physician satisfaction rates with montelukast add-on therapy were also significantly increased when compared with baseline treatment.

Phase 1 testing of ezatiostat, a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome was conducted in a multidose-escalation study. Patients received 10 dose levels (200, 400, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 mg) of ezatiostat tablets in divided doses on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles. The safety and pharmacokinetics of ezatiostat were evaluated. Forty-five patients with low to intermediate-2 International Prognostic Scoring System risk myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common grade 1 or 2, respectively, treatment-related adverse events were nonhematologic: nausea (56%, 9%), diarrhea (36%, 7%), vomiting (24%, 7%), abdominal pain (9%, 0%), constipation (4%, 9%), anorexia (3%, 7%), and dyspepsia (3%, 7%). Concentration of the primary active metabolite, TLK236, increased proportionate to ezatiostat dosage. Seventeen hematologic improvement (HI) responses by International Working Group criteria were observed at dose levels of 200 to 6000 mg/day with 11 HI responses at doses of 4000 to 6000 mg/day. HI responses occurred in all lineages including 3 bilineage and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Decreased number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions and in some cases transfusion independence were attained. Extended dose schedules of ezatiostat tablets are under investigation.

To assess the 54-week efficacy of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and pioglitazone, compared with pioglitazone monotherapy, and to assess safety in these groups during the 30 weeks after the dosage of pioglitazone was increased from 30 to 45 mg/day, in drug-naÏve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8-12%]. Following a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (Sitagliptin Protocol 064, Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00397631; Yoon KH, Shockey GR, Teng R et al. Effect of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and pioglitazone on glycaemic control and measures of beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Int J Clin Pract 2011; 65: 154-164) in which patients were treated with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg/day and pioglitazone 30 mg/day or monotherapy with pioglitazone 30 mg/day, patients entered a 30-week extension study. In the extension study, the pioglitazone dose was increased from 30 to 45 mg/day in both groups. Depending upon treatment allocation, patients took one tablet of sitagliptin 100 mg or matching placebo daily. Pioglitazone was administered in an open-label fashion as a single 45-mg tablet taken once daily. Patients not meeting specific glycaemic goals in the extension study were rescued with metformin therapy. Efficacy and safety results for the extension study excluded data after initiation of rescue therapy. Of the 520 patients initially randomized, 446 completed the base study and, of these, 317 entered the extension. In this extension study cohort, the mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the end of the base study (week 24) were -2.5% and -62.1 mg/dl with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg versus -1.9% and -48.7 mg/dl with pioglitazone monotherapy. At the end of the extension study (week 54), the mean reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was -2.4% with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 45 mg versus -1.9% with pioglitazone monotherapy [between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.5% (-0.8, -0.3)] and the mean reduction in FPG was -61.3 mg/dl versus -52.8 mg/dl, respectively [between-group difference (95% CI) = -8.5 mg/dl (-16.3, -0.7)]. Safety and tolerability of initial treatment with the combination of sitagliptin and pioglitazone and pioglitazone monotherapy were similar. As expected, increases in body weight from baseline were observed in both treatment groups at week 54: 4.8 and 4.1 kg in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively [between-group difference (95% CI) = 0.7 kg (-0.7, 2.1)]. In this study, initial combination therapy with sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg increased to 45 mg after 24 weeks led to a substantial and durable incremental improvement in glycaemic control compared with initial treatment with pioglitazone monotherapy during a 54-week treatment period. Both initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and pioglitazone and pioglitazone monotherapy were generally well tolerated (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01028391).

The majority of patients with essential hypertension of moderate severity (WHO grade 2) require combination therapy. We aimed to investigate whether the single-pill combination of aliskiren 300  mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 25  mg (ALIS 300/HCT 25) improves the BP reduction in hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by the free combination of candesartan 32  mg and HCT 25  mg (CAN 32 + HCT 25). In an open-label, single-arm study, patients with mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100-109  mmHg at baseline received 4-week treatment with CAN 32 + HCT 25 (Phase 1), followed - in patients whose BP was not controlled - by 4-week treatment with ALIS 300/HCT 25 (Phase 2). The DBP change between weeks 4 and 8 was the primary endpoint. The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT00867490. In the 186 patients treated, CAN 32 + HCT 25 reduced systolic BP (SBP)/DBP by 18.9/12.2 mmHg. Those 123 patients with uncontrolled hypertension switched to ALIS 300/HCT 25 experienced a further SBP/DBP reduction of 2.8/3.1  mmHg between week 4 and week 8 (p = 0.0064 and p < 0.0001), and 33.3% achieved DBP normalisation. In 61 patients not controlled after week 8 (SBP ≥ 140  mmHg or DBP  ≥  90  mmHg), who participated in an optional study extension, amlodipine 5  mg was added. Triple therapy over 4 weeks decreased SBP/DBP by further 9.2/5.9  mmHg (p < 0.0001 each). Adverse events with suspected drug relationship were noted in 4.3% (Phase 1), 3.3% (Phase 2), and 1.6% (extension) of the patients. Limitations of the study include the open-label, non-randomised approach and short treatment duration across the individual phases. In this open-label, single-arm switch study reflecting clinical practice, patients with moderate hypertension not controlled by the free combination of CAN 32 + HCT 25 achieved a clinically and statistically significant reduction of blood pressure from the single pill combination of ALIS 300/HCT 25, and the optional addition of amlodipine.

Children with autism spectrum disorders often present with comorbid anxiety disorders that cause significant functional impairment. This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with this profile. A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction. Forty children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a 3-month waitlist (36 completed treatment or waitlist). Therapists worked with individual families. The CBT model emphasized behavioral experimentation, parent-training, and school consultation. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews and parents and children completed anxiety symptom checklists at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. In intent-to-treat analyses, 78.5% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 8.7% of the waitlist group. CBT also outperformed the waitlist on diagnostic outcomes and parent reports of child anxiety, but not children's self-reports. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. The CBT manual employed in this study is one of the first adaptations of an evidence-based treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders. Remission of anxiety disorders appears to be an achievable goal among high-functioning children with autism.

Immunoglobulin replacement is a standard therapy for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulin offers more constant IgG levels than intravenous administration and simplifies administration for some patients. Use of L-proline as an excipient contributes to the stability of highly concentrated IgG preparations. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IgPro20 (Hizentra®), a new 20% subcutaneous IgG solution, and compare the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) with that of a similar intravenous 10% IgG solution (IgPro10; Privigen®). At the request of the US FDA, an algorithm for determining IgG trough level ratios (TLRs) was developed in order to provide physicians with a practical tool for monitoring doses during steady-state IgPro20 therapy. This was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase III clinical trial conducted in the US. The study was performed in a primary-care setting. Eligible patients were males or females aged 6-75 years with a primary immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency or X-linked agammaglobulinaemia) who had received regular treatment with IgPro10 for at least 3 months prior to entering this study and had achieved serum trough concentration (C(trough)) values ≥5 g/L. IgPro20 was administered subcutaneously once weekly at initial doses equivalent to 130% of patients' previous doses, based on the results obtained in a Vivaglobin® study and due to an FDA request. After run-in, each patient's dose was adjusted to achieve an AUC comparable to that achieved with IgPro10 administered intravenously. Eighteen patients completed the study. Mean IgPro20 : IgPro10 dose ratio (dose adjustment coefficient) was 1.53 (range 1.26-1.87). The resulting mean AUCs were 105.6 g · day/L for IgPro20 versus 103.2 g · day/L for IgPro10 (geometric mean ratio 1.002; lower one-sided 95% confidence limit [CL] 0.951). Thus, the primary endpoint of the study was met, as this result exceeded the pre-specified criterion of the lower one-sided 95% CL of ≥0.8 for non-inferiority. At these AUCs, which were considered equivalent, the mean IgPro20 : IgPro10 TLR, determined by the developed algorithm, was 1.29 (range 1.18-1.73). Titres of specific antibodies tested were well above respective product specifications, suggesting that protection against infection would be effective. Steady-state AUCs with subcutaneous IgPro20 and intravenous IgPro10 were equivalent. Mean dose adjustment coefficient and mean TLR can be used for initial dose conversion without risk of under-protection but vary too widely to be considered measures of equivalence.

To investigate the effects of continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) compared with subcutaneous insulin on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and treatment satisfaction, and to perform a cost analysis in type 1 diabetes. We used an open-label, prospective, crossover, randomized, 16-month study (N = 24). HRQOL and patient satisfaction were assessed with questionnaires (the 36-item short-form health survey [SF-36], the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5], and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire [DTSQ]). Direct costs of CIPII and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were compared. Questionnaire scores were higher with CIPII than with subcutaneous therapy. Yearly direct pump- and procedure-associated costs for CIPII were estimated at 10,910 euroscompared with 4,810 euros for CSII. Apart from improving glycemic control, CIPII improved HRQOL and treatment satisfaction compared with subcutaneous insulin. Direct pump- and procedure-associated costs are considerably higher for CIPII, however.

Studies of patients with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) have revealed that apoptotic tumor serves as a potential potent trigger for the initiation of naturally occurring tumor immunity. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. We have modeled PND tumor immunity in a clinical trial in which apoptotic allogeneic prostate tumor cells were used to generate an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Twenty-four prostate cancer patients were immunized in a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated. Importantly, we also found that the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, with no effect on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. A statistically significant increase in T cell proliferation responses to prostate tumor cells in vitro (p = 0.002), decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) slope (p = 0.016), and a two-fold increase in PSA doubling time (p = 0.003) were identified when we compared data before and after vaccination. An apoptotic cancer cell vaccine modeled on naturally occurring tumor immune responses in PND patients provides a safe and immunogenic tumor vaccine. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00289341.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2-127, and NCT00424268 for M2-128. In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p<0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p<0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal. Roflumilast improves lung function in patients with COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium, and could become an important treatment for these patients. Nycomed.

To compare the effects of drinking white wine or black tea with Swiss cheese fondue followed by a shot of cherry schnapps on gastric emptying, appetite, and abdominal symptoms. Randomised controlled crossover study. 20 healthy adults (14 men) aged 23-58. Cheese fondue (3260 kJ, 32% fat) labelled with 150 mg sodium (13)Carbon-octanoate was consumed with 300 ml of white wine (13%, 40 g alcohol) or black tea in randomised order, followed by 20 ml schnapps (40%, 8 g alcohol) or water in randomised order. Cumulative percentage dose of (13)C substrate recovered over four hours (higher values indicate faster gastric emptying) and appetite and dyspeptic symptoms (visual analogue scales). Gastric emptying was significantly faster when fondue was consumed with tea or water than with wine or schnapps (cumulative percentage dose of (13)C recovered 18.1%, 95% confidence interval 15.2% to 20.9% v 7.4%, 4.6% to 10.3%; P<0.001). An inverse dose-response relation between alcohol intake and gastric emptying was evident. Appetite was similar with consumption of wine or tea (difference 0.11, -0.12 to 0.34; P=0.35), but reduced if both wine and schnapps were consumed (difference -0.40, -0.01 to -0.79; P<0.046). No difference in dyspeptic symptoms was present. Gastric emptying after a Swiss cheese fondue is noticeably slower and appetite suppressed if consumed with higher doses of alcohol.

Deficits in joint attention (JA) and joint engagement (JE) represent a core problem in young children with autism as these affect language and social development. Studies of parent-mediated and specialist-mediated JA-intervention suggest that such intervention may be effective. However, there is little knowledge about the success of the intervention when done in preschools. Assess the effects of a preschool-based JA-intervention. 61 children (48 males) with autistic disorder (29-60 months) were randomized to either 8 weeks of JA-intervention, in addition to their preschool programs (n = 34), or to preschool programs only (n = 27). The intervention was done by preschool teachers with weekly supervision by trained counselors from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinics (CAMHC). Changes in JA and JE were measured by blinded independent testers using Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS) and video taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child play at baseline and post-intervention.

We prospectively analyzed the prognostic relevance of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) at diagnosis, after thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) induction therapy and double autotransplantation (ASCT) in 192 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Presence at baseline of at least 3 focal lesions (FLs; 44% of cases), a standardized uptake value (SUV) > 4.2 (46%), and extramedullary disease (EMD; 6%) adversely affected 4-year estimates of progression-free survival (PFS; ≥ 3 FLs: 50%; SUV > 4.2: 43%; presence of EMD: 28%). SUV > 4.2 and EMD were also correlated with shorter overall survival (OS; 4-year rates: 77% and 66%, respectively). Persistence of SUV > 4.2 after TD induction was an early predictor for shorter PFS. Three months after ASCT, PET/CT was negative in 65% of patients whose 4-year rates of PFS and OS were superior to those of PET-positive patients (PFS: 66% and OS: 89%). In a multivariate analysis, both EMD and SUV > 4.2 at baseline and persistence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake after ASCT were independent variables adversely affecting PFS. PET/CT involvement at diagnosis, after novel agent-based induction and subsequent ASCT is a reliable predictor of prognosis in MM patients.

The aim of this study was the comparison of a new double-coated paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent with bare-metal stent (BMS) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Stent coating with biodegradable polymers as a platform for elution of drugs has the potential for complete elution of drugs and for decreasing the risk of late complications. Multicenter randomized trial comparing a paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) coated with a biodegradable polymer and glycocalyx with the equivalent BMS. We randomly assigned 422 patients with de novo coronary lesions to PES (211 patients) or to BMS (211 patients). Primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Clinical secondary end points were target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis (ST), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Angiographic secondary end points were late loss and binary restenosis. At 1 year of follow-up, TVF rate was 9.5% in the PES group and 17.1% in the BMS group (P=0.02), and MACE rate was 10% in PES and 19% in BMS arm (P=0.009). All other secondary end points were reached but ST. ST rate was low and similar in both study arms. The study shows that patients treated with PES with dual coating technology had significantly lower incidence of TVF and MACE than those treated with BMS design; however, longer follow-up should be necessary to assess true advantages of this technology compared with the previous one.

Enhanced influenza vaccines are needed to provide improved protection for elderly individuals. The intradermal vaccination route was hypothesized to provide immunogenicity superior to that provided by the intramuscular vaccination route. In a multicenter, randomized study, 1107 volunteers >60 years of age received intradermal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 or 21 microg of hemagglutinin per strain or intramuscular control vaccine. Intradermal vaccines used a novel microinjection system designed to ensure easy, convenient, consistent vaccination. The primary end points of the study were the strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titers (GMTs) noted 21 days after vaccination. Groups were compared using noninferiority and superiority analyses. For each strain, the GMTs noted in association with each intradermal vaccine were superior to those noted with the intramuscular control (adjusted P< .0001). Seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and mean titer increases were also superior for intradermally administered vaccine in all but one of the analyses undertaken. Systemic reactogenicity was comparable between routes. Local injection site reactions, particularly erythema but not pain, were more commonly associated with intradermal vaccination. For the first time, the intradermal vaccination route has been used to elicit immune responses significantly superior to those noted in association with the conventional intramuscular vaccination route. This was done using an easy-to-use, reliable microinjection system. This superior response is expected to enhance annual protection against influenza in this vulnerable population.

This study was aimed 1) to investigate the predictive value of FDG PET/CT (fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography) for histopathologic response and 2) to explore the results of FDG PET/CT by molecular phenotypes of breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventy-eight stage II or III breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant docetaxel/doxorubicin chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. FDG PET/CTs were acquired before chemotherapy and after the first cycle of chemotherapy for evaluating early metabolic response. The mean pre- and post-chemotherapy standard uptake value (SUV) were 7.5 and 3.9, respectively. The early metabolic response provided by FDG PET/CT after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with the histopathologic response after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.002). Sensitivity and negative predictive value were 85.7% and 95.1%, respectively. The estrogen receptor negative phenotype had a higher pre-chemotherapy SUV (8.6 vs. 6.4, P = 0.047) and percent change in SUV (48% vs. 30%, P = 0.038). In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the pre-chemotherapy SUV was higher than in non-TNBC (9.8 vs. 6.4, P = 0.008). The early metabolic response using FDG PET/CT could have a predictive value for the assessment of histopathologic non-response of stage II/III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that the initial SUV and the decline in SUV differed based on the molecular phenotype.

Biologic lung volume reduction (BioLVR) is a new endobronchial treatment for advanced emphysema that reduces lung volume through tissue remodeling. Assess the safety and therapeutic dose of BioLVR hydrogel in upper lobe predominant emphysema. Open-labeled, multicenter phase 2 dose-ranging studies were performed with BioLVR hydrogel administered to eight subsegmental sites (four in each upper lobe) involving: (1) low-dose treatment (n = 28) with 10 ml per site (LD); and (2) high-dose treatment (n = 22) with 20 ml per site (HD). Safety was assessed by the incidence of serious medical complications. Efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in pulmonary function tests, dyspnea score, 6-minute walk distance, and health-related quality of life. After treatment there were no deaths and four serious treatment-related complications. A reduction in residual volume to TLC ratio at 12 weeks (primary efficacy outcome) was achieved with both LD (-6.4 +/- 9.3%; P = 0.002) and HD (-5.5 +/- 9.4%; P = 0.028) treatments. Improvements in pulmonary function in HD (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +15.6%; P = 0.002; DeltaFVC = +9.1%; P = 0.034) were greater than in LD patients (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +6.7%; P = 0.021; DeltaFVC = +5.1%; P = 0.139). LD- and HD-treated groups both demonstrated improved symptom scores and health-related quality of life. BioLVR improves physiology and functional outcomes up to 6 months with an acceptable safety profile in upper lobe predominant emphysema. Overall improvement was greater and responses more durable with 20 ml per site than 10 ml per site dosing. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00435253 and NCT 00515164).

To describe recruitment and enrollment experiences of 2 low back pain (LBP) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Descriptive report. Chiropractic research center in the midwest United States that is not a fee-for-service clinic. Both trials enrolled participants with subacute or chronic LBP without neurologic signs who had not received spinal manipulative care during the previous month. For study 1 we screened 1940 potential participants to enroll 192 participants (89 women and 103 men), mean age 40.0 +/- 9.4 years (range, 21-54 years). For study 2 we screened 1849 potential participants to enroll 240 participants (105 women and 135 men) at least 55 years old (mean, 63.1 +/- 6.7 years). Study 1 randomly assigned participants to 2 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or a wait list control group. Study 2 randomly assigned participants to 6 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or medical care consisting of 3 provider visits for medications. Recruitment source costs and yield, and baseline characteristics of enrolled versus nonparticipants were recorded. We conducted 3789 telephone screens for both trials to enroll 432 (11%) participants, at a cost in excess of $156,000 for recruitment efforts. The cost per call for all callers averaged $41, ranging from $4 to $300 based on recruitment method; for enrolled participants, the cost per call was $361, ranging from $33 to $750. Direct mail efforts accounted for 62% of all callers, 57% for enrolled participants, and had the second lowest cost per call for recruitment efforts. It is important that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research can be successfully conducted at CAM institutions. However, the costs associated with recruitment efforts for studies conducted at CAM institutions may be higher than expected and many self-identified participants are users of the CAM therapy. Therefore, strategies for efficient recruitment methods and targeting nonusers of CAM therapies should be developed early for CAM trials.

Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled, once-daily, ultra-long-acting β2-agonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This randomized, double-blind study compared the bronchodilator efficacy of indacaterol with that of placebo and tiotropium in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. In an incomplete-block, multi-dose, three-period, crossover design, patients received three of the following four treatments: indacaterol 150 μg, indacaterol 300 μg, tiotropium 18 μg and placebo, each once-daily for 14 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. Study drug was supplied daily by blinded, third party study personnel to maintain blinding of patients and investigators. The primary efficacy variable was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 24 h post-dose after 14 days. The study was powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of indacaterol to tiotropium for this variable. A total of 169 patients were randomized (mean age 65 years); 153 (90.5%) completed. Trough FEV1 after 14 days with indacaterol 150 μg and 300 μg was statistically and clinically superior to placebo, with differences (95% CI) of 170 (120-220) and 150 (100-200) mL respectively (both p < 0.001). For this endpoint, both doses of indacaterol not only met the criterion for non-inferiority compared with tiotropium, but also achieved numerically higher values, with differences versus tiotropium of 40 and 30 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 μg, respectively. At 5 min post-dose on Day 1, the mean FEV1 for both indacaterol doses was significantly higher than placebo (by 120 and 130 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 μg, respectively; p < 0.001) and tiotropium (by 80 mL for both doses; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported by similar proportions of patients: 31.4%, 29.5%, 28.3% and 28.5% for indacaterol 150 μg and 300 μg, tiotropium and placebo treatments, respectively. Once-daily indacaterol provided clinically and statistically significant 24-h bronchodilation. Indacaterol was at least as effective as tiotropium, with a faster onset of action (within 5 min) on the first day of dosing. Indacaterol should prove useful in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, for whom treatment with one or more classes of long-acting bronchodilator is recommended.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) group clinics can effectively control hypertension, but data to support glycemic control are equivocal. This study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of 2 DM group clinic interventions on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in primary care. Eighty-seven participants were recruited from a DM registry of a single regional Veterans Affairs medical center to participate in an open, randomized comparative effectiveness study. Two primary care-based DM group interventions of 3 months' duration were compared. Empowering Patients in Care (EPIC) was a clinician-led, patient-centered group clinic consisting of 4 sessions on setting self-management action plans (diet, exercise, home monitoring, medications, etc) and communicating about progress with action plans. The comparison intervention consisted of group education sessions with a DM educator and dietician followed by an additional visit with one's primary care provider. Hemoglobin A(1c) levels were compared after intervention and at the 1-year follow-up. Participants in the EPIC intervention had significantly greater improvements in HbA(1c) levels immediately following the active intervention (8.86%-8.04% vs 8.74%-8.70% of total hemoglobin; mean [SD] between-group difference 0.67% [1.3%]; P=.03), and these differences persisted at the 1 year follow-up (0.59% [1.4%], P=.05). A repeated-measures analysis using all study time points found a significant time-by-treatment interaction effect on HbA(1c) levels favoring the EPIC intervention (F(2,85)=3.55; P=.03). The effect of the time-by-treatment interaction seems to be partially mediated by DM self-efficacy (F(1,85)=10.39; P=.002). Primary care-based DM group clinics that include structured goal-setting approaches to self-management can significantly improve HbA(1c) levels after intervention and maintain improvements for 1 year.

Input:Randomized trial of the effect of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma in adults on disease-related quality of life and pulmonary function.  The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma compared to standard clinical care on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes. This was a prospective parallel group repeated measurement randomized design. Participants were adults aged 18 to 80 years with asthma. The intervention consisted of six group sessions on the use of nutritional manipulation, yoga techniques, and journaling. Participants also received nutritional supplements: fish oil, vitamin C, and a standardized hops extract. The control group received usual care. Primary outcome measures were the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). In total, 154 patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (77 control, 77 treatment).

Input:Effectiveness of open-label losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy in Asian patients with hypertension not controlled with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy.  Antihypertensive efficacy and safety of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combinations have not been adequately studied in Asians. In this open-label, 12-week study in seven Asian areas, patients on monotherapy with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) but not at blood pressure (BP) goal (sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) &lt;90 mm Hg in non-diabetics and &lt;80 mm Hg in diabetics) were switched to losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. At 4 and 8 weeks, the therapy for patients not at goal BP was titrated to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, respectively. Data analysis included 430 patients with mean (s.d.) age 53.0 (10.1) years and 51.9% of the female gender. After 8 weeks (primary end point; titration up to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg), 73.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 69.0-77.6) of patients reached BP goal; 63.4 and 78.1% of patients reached BP goal at 4 weeks (titration up to losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg) and at 12 weeks (titration up to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg). The mean changes from baseline (95% CI) in sitting systolic BP and SiDBP at 8 weeks were -16.7 (-18.0 to -15.4) mm Hg and -12.1 (-12.9 to -11.4) mm Hg, respectively. Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences (AEs) were reported in 27.5 and 21.0% of patients, respectively. Nine patients were discontinued because of drug-related clinical AEs. Switching Asian patients currently not at BP goal with ARB or ACEI monotherapy to a losartan/HCTZ combination achieved BP goal in the majority of patients. Losartan/HCTZ combinations were generally well tolerated. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Extract of Ginkgo biloba treatment for tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) is a potent antioxidant possessing free radical-scavenging activities. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of EGb-761, a standardized extract given in capsule form, in treating TD in schizophrenia patients. Inpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia and TD (n = 157) in a mainland China Veterans Affairs psychiatric hospital were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with either EGb-761, 240 mg/d (n = 78) or a placebo (n = 79) in a double-blind manner. Primary outcome measures were (1) change from baseline in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score and (2) proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% reduction in their AIMS total score at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive performance as measured by the Continuous Performance Test-37 Version and the 3-card Stroop task. Patients were recruited for the study between December 2006 and May 2007. Of the 157 patients who were randomly assigned, 152 (96.8%) completed the study. EGb-761 treatment significantly decreased the AIMS total score in patients with TD compared to those who were given a placebo (2.13 ± 1.75 vs -0.10 ± 1.69; P &lt; .0001), with 40 (51.3%) and 4 (5.1%) patients achieving response in the EGb-761 and placebo treatment groups, respectively. There were no between-group differences in the PANSS total score or cognitive measures from baseline to week 12. EGb-761 appears to be an effective treatment for reducing the symptoms of TD in schizophrenia patients, and improvement may be mediated through the well-known antioxidant activity of this extract. clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00672373.

Input:Safety and efficacy of dual therapy with GSK233705 and salmeterol versus monotherapy with salmeterol, tiotropium, or placebo in a crossover pilot study in partially reversible COPD patients.  GSK233705 is an inhaled, long-acting muscarinic antagonist in development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was performed to see if the addition of GSK233705 to salmeterol would provide greater bronchodilation than salmeterol or tiotropium alone in COPD. In an incomplete-block, three-period, crossover design, dually responsive patients received three of the following five treatments: GSK233705 20 μg plus salmeterol 50 μg twice-daily; GSK233705 50 μg plus salmeterol 50 μg twice-daily; salmeterol 50 μg or placebo, each twice-daily; and tiotropium 18 μg or placebo once-daily for 7 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. The primary efficacy endpoint was morning (trough) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) on Day 8, following 7 days of treatment. Secondary endpoints included pulmonary function, plethysmography, pharmacokinetics of GSK233705 and salmeterol, adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory parameters. A total of 47 patients were randomized. The mean % predicted normal postbronchodilator FEV(1) was 55% at screening. Compared with placebo (n = 24), the adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV(1) on Day 8 was 215 mL higher with GSK233705 20 μg + salmeterol (n = 23) and 203 mL higher with GSK233705 50 μg + salmeterol (n = 27), whereas with salmeterol (n = 27) and tiotropium (n = 28) the changes were 101 mL and 118 mL higher, respectively. The primary efficacy results were supported by the results from the other secondary lung function assessments. AEs were reported by similar proportions of patients across the treatment groups, with headache the most frequently reported treatment-related AE reported by one subject receiving each of GSK233705 20 μg + salmeterol, tiotropium, and placebo. No significant differences were seen in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory parameters between the groups. The addition of GSK233705 to salmeterol in partially reversible COPD patients resulted in greater bronchodilation than salmeterol or tiotropium alone and was well tolerated.

Input:Multidetector-row computed tomography-based clinical assessment of fondaparinux for treatment of acute pulmonary embolism and acute deep vein thrombosis in Japanese patients.  Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the standard drug for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Japan, whereas fondaparinux is the standard drug in Europe and the United States. Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in Japanese patients. In 2 randomized, open-label, multicenter studies, 80 Japanese patients with acute PE or DVT received either subcutaneous fondaparinux or intravenous UFH as a non-comparative reference, in a 3:1 ratio, for 5-10 days. Concomitant warfarin therapy was continued until Day 90. Multidetector-row computed tomography-based assessment showed that 57.9% and 45.9% of the patients with acute PE and acute proximal DVT had proximal DVT and PE as a complication, respectively. There was no recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. In the fondaparinux group, the respective improvement rates at the end of the initial treatment and follow-up periods were 71.4% and 86.8% for 42 patients with PE, and 57.8% and 83.3% for 46 patients with DVT; similar results were noted in the UFH group. One patient in the fondaparinux group experienced major bleeding during the initial treatment, but no such episode in the UFH group. Once-daily, subcutaneous fondaparinux is as effective and safe without monitoring as adjusted-dose intravenous UFH for the initial treatment of acute PE and DVT in Japanese patients.

Input:Extended-release tramadol/paracetamol in moderate-to-severe pain: a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with acute low back pain.  Combinations of oral analgesics may offer several potential benefits compared with an individual agent. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of an extended-release, twice-daily fixed combination of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg paracetamol (DDS-06C) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain, using acute low back pain as a model. In this phase III study, 277 patients with moderate-to-severe acute low back pain were randomized to 1-2 tablets of DDS-06C or placebo every 10-12 h for 2.5 days during the double-blind phase. Following the double-blind phase, patients had the option to continue for a 2.5-day open-label phase. Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00643383) The primary end point was the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) over the 50-h double-blind phase (SPID50). Secondary end points included total pain relief score over the 50-h double-blind phase (TOTPAR50), patient's global impression of medication, and SPID over the first 4 h. A statistically significant (p = 0.038) greater decrease in pain intensity was observed in the DDS-06C group (median SPID50: -6.0) versus placebo (median SPID50: -4.0). Greater pain relief was also observed in patients randomized to DDS-06C: the median TOTPAR50 was 13.0 for the DDS-06C group and 11.0 for placebo (p = 0.026). DDS-06C demonstrated statistically significant superior efficacy compared with placebo for the majority of the other secondary end points. Overall, 38% of patients treated with DDS-06C experienced at least one adverse event; the intensity was mild-to-moderate in 81% of cases. The most commonly reported adverse events (>5% of patients receiving DDS-06C) were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and somnolence. Using acute low back pain, a model with a high degree of heterogeneity and intrinsic variability, DDS-06C was superior to placebo on measures of pain intensity and relief, and was well-tolerated.

Input:Helicobacter pylori eradication with a capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline given with omeprazole versus clarithromycin-based triple therapy: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.  Helicobacter pylori is associated with benign and malignant diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and increasing antibiotic resistance has made alternative treatments necessary. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new, single-capsule treatment versus the gold standard for H pylori eradication. We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 39 sites in Europe, comparing the efficacy and safety of 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline (quadruple therapy) versus 7 days of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (standard therapy) in adults with recorded H pylori infection. Patients were randomly assigned treatment according to a predetermined list independently generated by Quintiles Canada (Ville St-Laurent, QC, Canada). Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial but was powered to detect superiority. Our primary outcome was H pylori eradication, established by two negative (13)C urea breath tests at a minimum of 28 and 56 days after the end of treatment. Our assessment for non-inferiority was in the per-protocol population, with subsequent assessment for superiority in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants randomly assigned treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00669955. 12 participants were lost to follow-up and 101 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population (n=339), the lower bound of the CI for treatment with quadruple therapy was greater than the pre-established non-inferiority margin of -10% (95% CI 15·1-32·3; p&lt;0·0001). In the intention-to-treat population (n=440), eradication rates were 80% (174 of 218 participants) in the quadruple therapy group versus 55% (123 of 222) in the standard therapy group (p&lt;0·0001). Safety profiles for both treatments were similar; main adverse events were gastrointestinal and CNS disorders. Quadruple therapy should be considered for first-line treatment in view of the rising prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H pylori, especially since quadruple therapy provides superior eradication with similar safety and tolerability to standard therapy.

Input:Roflumilast in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with longacting bronchodilators: two randomised clinical trials.  Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2-127, and NCT00424268 for M2-128. In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal. Roflumilast improves lung function in patients with COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium, and could become an important treatment for these patients. Nycomed. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:StrataGraft skin substitute is well-tolerated and is not acutely immunogenic in patients with traumatic wounds: results from a prospective, randomized, controlled dose escalation trial.  The goal of this study was to assess the immunogenicity and antigenicity of StrataGraft skin tissue in a randomized phase I/II clinical trial for the temporary management of full-thickness skin loss. StrataGraft skin tissue consists of a dermal equivalent containing human dermal fibroblasts and a fully stratified, biologically active epidermis derived from Near-diploid Immortalized Keratinocyte S (NIKS) cells, a pathogen-free, long-lived, consistent, human keratinocyte progenitor. Traumatic skin wounds often require temporary allograft coverage to stabilize the wound bed until autografting is possible. StrataGraft and cadaveric allograft were placed side by side on 15 patients with full-thickness skin defects for 1 week before autografting. Allografts were removed from the wound bed and examined for allogeneic immune responses. Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence were used to assess tissue structure and cellular composition of allografts. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays, chromium-release assays, and development of antibodies were used to examine allogeneic responses. One week after patient exposure to allografts, there were no differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes or Langerhans cells present in StrataGraft skin substitute compared to cadaver allograft, the standard of care. Importantly, exposure to StrataGraft skin substitute did not induce the proliferation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to NIKS keratinocytes or enhance cell-mediated lysis of NIKS keratinocytes in vitro. Similarly, no evidence of antibody generation targeted to the NIKS keratinocytes was seen. These findings indicate that StrataGraft tissue is well-tolerated and not acutely immunogenic in patients with traumatic skin wounds. Notably, exposure to StrataGraft did not increase patient sensitivity toward or elicit immune responses against the NIKS keratinocytes. We envision that this novel skin tissue technology will be widely used to facilitate the healing of traumatic cutaneous wounds.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00618839).

Input:Evaluating the efficacy of lay health advisors for increasing risk-appropriate Pap test screening: a randomized controlled trial among Ohio Appalachian women.  Cervical cancer is a significant health disparity among women in Ohio Appalachia. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention for improving Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rates, to reduce cervical cancer, among women in need of screening. Women from 14 Ohio Appalachian clinics in need of a Pap test were randomized to receive either usual care or an LHA intervention over a 10-month period. The intervention consisted of two in-person visits with an LHA, two phone calls, and four postcards. Both self-report and medical record review (MRR) data (primary outcome) were analyzed. Of the 286 women, 145 and 141 were randomized to intervention and usual care arms, respectively. According to MRR, more women in the LHA arm had a Pap test by the end of the study compared with those randomized to usual care (51.1% vs. 42.0%; OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.89-2.33; P = 0.135). Results of self-report were more pronounced (71.3% vs. 54.2%; OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.22-3.61; P = 0.008). An LHA intervention showed some improvement in the receipt of Pap tests among Ohio Appalachian women in need of screening. Although biases inherent in using self-reports of screening are well known, this study also identified biases in using MRR data in clinics located in underserved areas. LHA interventions show promise for improving screening behaviors among nonadherent women from underserved populations. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Ontario multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography study: field evaluation of diagnostic accuracy.  Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) has gained clinical acceptance for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although single-center studies have demonstrated excellent accuracy, multicenter studies have yielded variable results. The true diagnostic accuracy of CTCA in the "real world" remains uncertain. We conducted a field evaluation comparing multidetector CTCA with invasive CA (ICA) to understand CTCA's diagnostic accuracy in a real-world setting. A multicenter cohort study of patients awaiting ICA was conducted between September 2006 and June 2009. All patients had either a low or an intermediate pretest probability for coronary artery disease and underwent CTCA and ICA within 10 days. The results of CTCA and ICA were interpreted visually by local expert observers who were blinded to all clinical data and imaging results. Using a patient-based analysis (diameter stenosis ≥50%) of 169 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 81.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.0%-89.1%), 93.3% (95% CI, 85.9%-97.5%), 91.6% (95% CI, 82.5%-96.8%), and 84.7% (95% CI, 76.0%-91.2%), respectively; the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.873. The diagnostic accuracy varied across centers (P &lt; .001), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value ranging from 50.0% to 93.2%, 92.0% to 100%, 84.6% to 100%, and 42.9% to 94.7%, respectively. Compared with ICA, CTCA appears to have good accuracy; however, there was variability in diagnostic accuracy across centers. Factors affecting institutional variability need to be better understood before CTCA is universally adopted. Additional real-world evaluations are needed to fully understand the impact of CTCA on clinical care. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00371891. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Antiviral activity and safety of LB80380 in hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine-resistant disease.  We aimed to determine the antiviral activity and safety of a new nucleotide analogue, LB80380, in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with lamivudine-resistant virus. Sixty-five patients with lamivudine-resistant virus were randomized to receive five ascending daily doses (30, 60, 90, 150, 240 mg) of LB80380. LB80380 was given together with lamivudine for the first 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of LB80380 monotherapy. This was then followed by 24 weeks of adefovir. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, serology, liver biochemistry, and safety were monitored. The extent of the HBV DNA reduction at week 12 was dose-dependent. The mean reduction from baseline was 2.81, 3.21, 3.92, 4.16, and 4.00 log(10) copies/mL for the five ascending dose groups. The dose-proportionate effect was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) with a decrease of HBV DNA levels by an average of 1.54 log(10) copies/mL for every 1-unit increase in log(10) dose of LB80380. In 93.4% of patients, HBV DNA decreased by >2 log(10) copies/mL, and 11.5% of patients had undetectable HBV DNA levels (&lt;300 copies/mL) by week 12. HBV DNA suppression was maintained during the 24 weeks of adefovir treatment. Hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion and normalization of alanine aminotransferase were seen in 14.6% and 24.6% of patients, respectively, at week 12; 44.6% of patients experienced mild and self-limiting adverse events, none of which were attributed to the study drug. LB80380 at doses of up to 240 mg is safe, well tolerated, and effective at reducing viral load in CHB patients with lamivudine-resistant virus for a period of 12 weeks. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Treatment of plaque-type psoriasis with oral CF101: data from an exploratory randomized phase 2 clinical trial.  CF101 demonstrated a marked anti-inflammatory effect in Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and dry eye syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CF101 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. This was a phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study. Seventy five patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis were enrolled, randomized and treated with CF101 (1, 2, or 4 mg) or placebo administered orally twice daily for 12 weeks. Safety and change from base line of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and physician's global assessment (PGA) score over 12 weeks. In the 2 mg CF101-treated group, a progressive improvement in the mean change from baseline in the PASI score vs. placebo throughout the study period was observed, with a statistically significant difference on weeks 8 and 12 (P = 0.047; P = 0.031, respectively). In this group, 35.3% of the patients achieved PASI ≥ 50 response, and 23.5% of the patients achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1. CF101 was safe and well tolerated. CF101 was well tolerated and demonstrated clear evidence of efficacy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CRd) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: results from a phase 2 trial.  The combination of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). Addition of alkylating agents to lenalidomide or thalidomide results in increased response rates and deeper responses. We designed this trial to study the combination of cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (CRd) as initial therapy for MM. Fifty-three patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM was enrolled. Patients received 4-week treatment cycles consisting of lenalidomide (25 mg daily for 3 weeks), dexamethasone (40 mg weekly), and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2) weekly for 3 weeks). A partial response or better was seen in 85% of patients including 47% with a very good partial response or better. The toxicities were manageable with over 80% of planned doses delivered; six patients went off study for toxicity. The median progression free survival (PFS) for the entire group was 28 months (95% CI: 22.7-32.6) and the overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 87% (95% CI: 78-96). Importantly, 14 patients with high-risk MM had similar PFS and OS as the standard-risk patients (n = 39). CRd is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for upfront therapy of MM with high response rates and excellent 2-year OS, and is suitable for long-term therapy. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Low and moderate-fat plant sterol fortified soymilk in modulation of plasma lipids and cholesterol kinetics in subjects with normal to high cholesterol concentrations: report on two randomized crossover studies.  Although consumption of various plant sterol (PS)-enriched beverages is effective in lowering plasma cholesterol, the lipid-lowering potential of PS in a soymilk format has not been investigated thoroughly. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of PS-enriched soy beverages on plasma lipids and cholesterol kinetics, we conducted two separate 28 d dietary controlled cross-over studies. In study 1, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a low-fat (2 g/serving) PS enriched soy beverage was examined in 33 normal cholesterolemic subjects in comparison with 1% dairy milk. In study 2, we investigated the efficacy of a moderate-fat (3.5 g/serving) PS-enriched soy beverage on plasma cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol kinetic responses in 23 hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with 1% dairy milk. Both the low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk varieties provided 1.95 g PS/d. Endpoint plasma variables were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using baseline values as covariates for plasma lipid measurements. In comparison with the 1% dairy milk control, the low-fat soy beverage reduced (P &lt; 0.05) total and LDL-cholesterol by 10 and 13%, respectively. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverage reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plasma total and LDL-cholesterol by 12 and 15% respectively. Fasting triglycerides were reduced by 9.4% following consumption of the moderate-fat soy beverage in comparison with the 1% dairy milk. Both low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy varieties reduced (P &lt; 0.05) LDL:HDL and TC:HDL ratios compared with the 1% dairy milk control. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk reduced (P &lt; 0.05) cholesterol absorption by 27%, but did not alter cholesterol synthesis in comparison with 1% dairy milk. We conclude that, compared to 1% dairy milk, consumption of low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverages represents an effective dietary strategy to reduce circulating lipid concentrations in normal to hypercholesterolemic individuals by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Input:A prospective, randomized, comparative trial evaluating respiratory depression during patient-controlled versus anesthesiologist-administered propofol-remifentanil sedation for elective colonoscopy.  Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) with propofol-remifentanil (PR) is associated with rapid sedation and recovery, but it is associated with a greater requirement for airway rescue than PCS with midazolam-fentanyl. To demonstrate that respiratory depression associated with PR is more frequent during anesthesiologist-administered sedation (AAS) than during PCS. Prospective, randomized, open-label study. Academic medical center. Fifty patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. PCS or AAS using PR. All patients breathed 100% oxygen via an anesthesia mask with continuous spirometry and bispectral index (BIS). Respiratory rate and BIS. Colonoscopy was completed in all patients. No patient under PCS required airway rescue. Five patients under AAS required bag-mask ventilation to resolve Sao(2) (arterial oxygen saturation) less than 90% lasting longer than 30 seconds. The median BIS for the AAS group was 71.7 (range 61.06-82.34) and 88.1 (range 83.15-93.05) for the PCS group. Median respiratory rates were 5.97 (range 1.21-10.73) breaths per minute for AAS and 13.19 (range 9.54-16.84) for PCS. Respiratory rates less than 2 breaths per minute composed 28% of the procedure time for AAS, but only 5% for PCS. Patients under PCS had lower median predicted effect site concentrations for PR, but were able to achieve brief peak levels exceeding those with AAS. These differences were significant (P &lt; .001). Potential for bias with AAS. Patients undergoing colonoscopy with PR are significantly more likely to require intervention for hypoventilation compared with PCS. ( NCT00868920.).

Input:Brief report of a clinical trial on the duration of middle ear effusion in young children using a standardized osteopathic manipulative medicine protocol.  Osteopathic physicians have used osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) to treat patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and its sequelae (eg, middle ear effusion [MEE], conductive hearing loss) for more than a century. However, few clinical trials document the efficacy of OMM, perhaps because of various challenges related to OMM clinical trials. To describe a research protocol studying the efficacy of OMM on MEE after an episode of AOM, comment on the feasibility of the protocol and statistical analysis, and report on lessons learned in the first 9 months of the study. Dual-site, prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial comparing OMM plus standard care to standard care only for MEE after an episode of AOM. Standard care comprised antibiotics and surgery. Patients were aged between 6 months and 24 months, were diagnosed as having AOM, were referred to the study by a participating pediatric provider, and had abnormal tympanogram results on entry into the study. All patients had 5 weekly study visits, and patients in the intervention group received OMM on visits 1 through 3. Patients received weekly tympanogram and acoustic reflectometer readings as well as daily at-home acoustic reflectometer readings for 30 days. Fifty-six patients were screened, 34 subjects were enrolled, and 26 subjects completed the study protocol in the first 9 months of the study. This resulted in 22 "ears" in the standard card only group and 18 "ears" in the standard care plus OMM group, resulting in 40 cases of AOM studied in the first year of the trial. The OMM treatment protocol was easily administered without serious adverse events. Protocols for interpretation of tympanogram readings and conversion of data for statistical analysis resulted in analyzable data. The OMM protocol can be administered with no serious adverse events. Subject recruitment is difficult, and a full-time research assistant at the referring site improves subject referral, enrollment and retention. Accepting only confirmed cases of AOM from trained pediatric providers reduces the patient pool but increases the reliability of the data. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00520039).

Input:Tolerability and efficacy of memantine add-on therapy to rivastigmine transdermal patches in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study.  To compare the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy of memantine plus rivastigmine patch with rivastigmine patch monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, patients entered an 8-week run-in period (a 5 cm 2 rivastigmine patch for 4 weeks, then a 10 cm(2) patch for 4 weeks) followed by 16 weeks of memantine plus rivastigmine patch or rivastigmine patch monotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the retention rate at the end of the trial. clinicaltrials.gov. NCT01025466. Overall, 88 and 84 patients received rivastigmine patch with and without memantine, respectively, and of these, 77 (87.5%) and 70 (83.3%) patients completed the study. The difference in retention rate was not significant (95% confidence interval: -6.3-14.7%). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) (53.4 vs. 50.6%) and discontinuation due to AEs (6.8 vs. 4.8%) were not different between patients with and without memantine. The most frequent AEs were skin irritation in patients with and without memantine (42.0 vs. 34.9%, p = 0.71), but discontinuation due to skin irritation was rare (4.5 vs. 2.4%, p = 0.74). The incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was very low in patients with and without memantine (nausea, 2.3 vs. 1.2%; vomiting, 1.1 vs. 1.2%). The Korean Version of the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores favored rivastigmine patch monotherapy at the end of treatment (p = 0.01). Changes in other efficacy measures were similar between the groups. There were no significant differences in tolerability and safety between the treatment groups.

Input:A novel injectable formulation of diclofenac compared with intravenous ketorolac or placebo for acute moderate-to-severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose study.  Injectable formulations of diclofenac have long been available in Europe and other countries. These formulations use a default dose of 75 mg of diclofenac delivered IV over 30 to 120 minutes or as an IM injection. A novel formulation of injectable diclofenac sodium, Dyloject®, is solubilized with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) so that it can be given IV or IM in a small volume bolus. In this multicenter, multiple-dose, multiple-day, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study, we investigated whether lower doses of HPβCD diclofenac delivered as a small volume bolus would be effective for the management of acute pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery. Adults with moderate and severe pain, defined as ≥50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, within 6 hours after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive HPβCD diclofenac, 18.75 mg or 37.5 mg; ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg; or placebo. Patients in all treatment arms received a bolus IV injection every 6 hours until discharged. They were observed for at least 48 h, and for up to 5 days. Rescue IV morphine was available any time, up to a total of 7.5 mg over a 3-hour period. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of pain intensity differences from 0 to 48 hours after study drug initiation. Three hundred thirty-one patients received ≥1 dose of study drug. Over the first 48 hours, both IV HPβCD diclofenac doses, as well as ketorolac, produced significant reductions in pain intensity over placebo (all P &lt; 0.05), as well as significant reductions in the need for rescue morphine administration. Both doses of HPβCD diclofenac, as well as ketorolac, significantly reduced rescue morphine dosages, as compared to placebo (P &lt; 0.0001), and time to rescue morphine administration was significantly increased by treatment with 18.75 mg diclofenac and ketorolac. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 20.2%. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either diclofenac dose group, whereas only 1 was reported in the ketorolac group. For patients with acute moderate and severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery, repeated 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg doses of HPβCD diclofenac provided significant analgesic efficacy, as compared to placebo. Significant analgesic efficacy was also provided by the active comparator ketorolac. Both HPβCD diclofenac and ketorolac significantly reduced the need for opioids. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Lamotrigine for trigeminal neuralgia: efficacy and safety in comparison with carbamazepine.  Anticonvulsants are regarded as useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and occurrence of side effects of lamotrigine (LTG) in comparison with carbamazepine (CBZ), in trigeminal neuralgia (TN) patients. The study was an interventional and crossover comparison. Twenty-one patients with TN were administered with LTG in comparison to CBZ. The clinical trials comprised two phases of 40 days each, with an intervening three-day washout period. The final titration in dose for LTG was 400 mg and 1,200 mg for CBZ. Efficacy of the medications involved was determined by visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS). Side effects were recorded through marking of the profiles of side effects encountered on administration of LTG and CBZ, together with baseline haematological, hepatic and renal investigations. Both on VAS and VRS assessments, in terms of proportion of patients, CBZ benefitted 90.5% (19/21) of the patients with pain relief (p &lt; 0.05), in contrast to 62% (13/21) from LTG. On VAS assessment, of the 13 patients who gained pain relief from LTG and 19 from CBZ, 77% (10/13) obtained a "complete" degree of pain relief from LTG, as compared with 21% (4/19) from CBZ. On VRS assessment, with LTG, 84% (11/13) of the patients accomplished "much better" degree of pain relief, as compared with 26% (5/19) with CBZ. On LTG, 67% (14/21) of patients endured general pharmacological side effects, as compared with 57% (12/21) of patients on CBZ (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, LTG inflicted 14% (3/21) of the patients with haematological, hepatic and renal derangements, as compared with 48% (10/21) on CBZ. LTG is generally an effective and safe treatment for management of TN, compared to CBZ. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate combination for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pediatric patients in Gabon.  The development of novel artemisinin-combination therapies suitable for the treatment of pediatric patients suffering from malaria is a research priority. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate combination for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Gabonese patients 2-14 years old. The study was designed as an open-label dose-escalation study recruiting 60 pediatric patients sequentially in 4 treatment cohorts: study drugs were administered once daily for 3 days, as tablet coformulations (pyronaridine:artesunate ratios of 6:2, 9:3, and 12:4 mg/kg) and as a granule coformulation (pyronaridine:artesunate ratio of 9:3 mg/kg). The primary end points were tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of pyronaridine-artesunate treatment. Efficacy was treated as a secondary outcome measure. The drugs had a good tolerability and safety profile, at all dose levels. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the maximum plasma/blood concentration and the area under the curve, as well as comparable relative bioavailability for the granule coformulation. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates at day 28 were 100% in per-protocol analysis, at all dose levels. Pyronaridine-artesunate is a promising novel artemisinin-combination therapy for pediatric patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and the development of both the tablet and the granule coformulations is warranted.

Input:Three-month, randomized, parallel-group comparison of brimonidine-timolol versus dorzolamide-timolol fixed-combination therapy.  Fixed combinations of 0.2% brimonidine-0.5% timolol and 2% dorzolamide-0.5% timolol are used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the IOP-lowering efficacy and ocular tolerability of brimonidine-timolol compared with dorzolamide-timolol when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to a prostaglandin analog (PGA) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Pooled data analysis of two randomized, investigator-masked, 3-month, parallel-group studies with identical protocols (ten sites). In all, 180 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were in need of lower IOP received topical brimonidine-timolol BID or dorzolamide-timolol BID as monotherapy (n = 101) or as adjunctive therapy to a PGA (latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost) (n = 79). The studies are registered with the identifiers NCT00822081 and NCT00822055 at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. IOP was measured at 10 a.m. (peak effect) at baseline and at months 1 and 3. Tolerability/comfort was evaluated using a patient questionnaire. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in patient demographics. Most patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 68 years. There were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in baseline IOP. At month 3, the mean (SD) reduction from baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination monotherapy was 7.7 (4.2) mmHg (32.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 6.7 (5.0) mmHg (26.1%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.040). The mean reduction from PGA-treated baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination adjunctive therapy was 6.9 (4.8) mmHg (29.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 5.2 (3.7) mmHg (23.5%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.213). Patients on brimonidine-timolol reported less burning (p &lt; 0.001), stinging (p &lt; 0.001), and unusual taste (p &lt; 0.001) than patients on dorzolamide-timolol. Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol provided the same or greater IOP lowering compared with fixed-combination dorzolamide-timolol. Both fixed-combination medications were safe and well-tolerated. Brimonidine-timolol received higher ratings of ocular comfort than dorzolamide-timolol. The duration of the studies was 3 months, and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine-timolol and dorzolamide-timolol during long-term treatment.

Input:Single-dose liposomal amphotericin B for visceral leishmaniasis in India.  Some 50% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) worldwide live in the Indian state of Bihar. Liposomal amphotericin B is an effective treatment when administered in short courses. We wanted to determine whether the efficacy of a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was inferior to conventional parenteral therapy, consisting of 15 alternate-day infusions of amphotericin B deoxycholate. In this open-label study, we randomly assigned 412 patients in a 3:1 ratio to receive either liposomal amphotericin B (liposomal-therapy group) or amphotericin B deoxycholate (conventional-therapy group). Liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given once, and patients were discharged home 24 hours later. Amphotericin B deoxycholate, which was administered in 15 infusions of 1 mg per kilogram, was given every other day during a 29-day hospitalization. We determined the cure rate 6 months after treatment. A total of 410 patients--304 of 304 patients (100%) in the liposomal-therapy group and 106 of 108 patients (98%) in the conventional-therapy group--had apparent cure responses at day 30. Cure rates at 6 months were similar in the two groups: 95.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.4 to 97.9) in the liposomal-therapy group and 96.3% (95% CI, 92.6 to 99.9) in the conventional-therapy group. Adverse events in the liposomal-therapy group were infusion-related fever or rigors (in 40%) and increased anemia or thrombocytopenia (in 2%); such events in the conventional-therapy group were fever or rigors (in 64%), increased anemia (in 19%), and hypokalemia (in 2%). Nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity developed in no more than 1% of patients in each group. A single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was not inferior to and was less expensive than conventional therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00628719.)

Input:Albinterferon Alfa-2b was not inferior to pegylated interferon-α in a randomized trial of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1.  The current standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 is once-weekly pegylated interferon-α (Peg-IFNα) plus daily ribavirin for 48 weeks. We evaluated the efficacy/safety of albinterferon alfa-2b (albIFN), a novel, long-acting, genetic fusion polypeptide of albumin and IFNα-2b. In the phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 trial, 1331 patients were assigned equally to 3 open-label, 48-week treatment groups: Peg-IFNα-2a 180 μg every week, or albIFN 900 or 1200 μg every 2 weeks administered subcutaneously, with weight-based oral ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. During the study, the data monitoring committee recommended dose modification for all patients receiving albIFN 1200 μg to 900 μg because of increased pulmonary adverse events (AEs) in the 1200-μg arms of both ACHIEVE studies. Main outcome measure was sustained virologic response (SVR; undetectable serum HCV RNA at week 72). Intention-to-treat SVR rates were 51.0% (225/441), 48.2% (213/442), and 47.3% (208/440) with Peg-IFNα-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1200 μg, respectively. The primary objective of showing noninferiority of albIFN 900 μg (P &lt; .001) and 1200 μg (P = .003) vs Peg-IFNα-2a for SVR was achieved. Multivariate modeling indicated consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Serious/severe AE rates were 23.1%, 24.0%, 28.2%; treatment discontinuation rates because of AEs were 4.1%, 10.4%, 10.0%; discontinuation rates because of respiratory AEs were 0%, 0.9%, 1.6%; with Peg-IFNα-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1200 μg, respectively. Hematologic abnormality rates were comparable across the Peg-IFNα-2a and albIFN 900-μg groups. albIFN 900 μg every 2 weeks showed comparable efficacy, with similar serious/severe AE rates, although with a higher discontinuation rate, vs Peg-IFNα-2a in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1.

Input:The combination of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg produces less peripheral oedema than amlodipine 10 mg in hypertensive patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg.  To demonstrate the benefit of the combination amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg over amlodipine 10 mg, in producing a lower incidence of peripheral oedema for a comparable mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) reduction. After a 4-week amlodipine 5 mg run-in phase, inadequately controlled hypertension patients (aged > or = 55 years, MSSBP > or = 130 and &lt; or = 160 mmHg) were randomised to receive amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg or amlodipine 10 mg for 8 weeks, followed by amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg for 4 weeks for all patients. Primary variables were MSSBP change from baseline to week 8 and incidence of peripheral oedema reported as an AE. Resolution of peripheral oedema was assessed 4 weeks after switching patients from amlodipine 10 mg to amlodipine/ valsartan 5/160 mg. At week 8, MSSBP showed greater reduction with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg than amlodipine 10 mg (least square mean: -8.01 vs.-5.95 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001 for non-inferiority and p = 0.002 for superiority). Systolic control, overall BP control and systolic response rate at week 8 were significantly higher with combination than amlodipine 10 mg (34 vs. 26%; 57 vs. 50%; 36.57 vs. 27.77%, respectively). Incidence of peripheral oedema was significantly lower with the combination than amlodipine 10 mg (6.6 vs. 31.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Peripheral oedema resolved in 56% patients who switched from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination, without the loss of effect on BP reduction. In non-responders to amlodipine 5 mg, treatment with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg induced significantly less peripheral oedema than amlodipine 10 mg for similar BP reduction. Peripheral oedema resolved in > 50% patients switching from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Therapeutic benefit of internet-based lifestyle counselling for hypertension.  Preventive electronic (e)-counselling has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. However, heterogeneity in outcomes is commonly reported due to differences in e-protocols. We incorporated key features of an established behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, to help standardize e-counselling in order to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Subjects (n = 387, mean age = 56 years, 59% female, 72% taking ≥ 1 antihypertensive drug) were diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 hypertension. Subjects were randomized to a 4-month protocol of e-counselling (beta version of the "Blood Pressure Action Plan", Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada) vs waitlist control (general e-information on heart-healthy living). Outcomes were systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, and total lipoprotein cholesterol after treatment. Intention to treat analysis did not find a significant group difference in outcomes due to contamination across the 2 arms of this trial. However, per protocol analysis indicated that subjects receiving ≥ 8 e-counselling messages (a priori therapeutic dose) vs 0 e-counselling messages (control) demonstrated greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean, -8.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.5 to -6.4 vs -5.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.7 to -3.3, P = 0.03), pulse pressure (-6.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.1 to -4.1 vs -3.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.3 to -1.8, P = 0.02) and total cholesterol (-0.24 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.06 vs 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.16, P = 0.03), but not diastolic blood pressure. These findings support the merit of evaluating whether e-counselling can improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular risk over the long-term. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:A Polypill for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a feasibility study of the World Health Organization.  The feasibility of conducting a large-scale Polypill clinical trial in developing countries remains unclear. More information is needed regarding the efficacy in reducing the risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD), side effects, improvement in adherence and physician/patient "acceptability" of the Polypill. We conducted an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial involving three sites in Sri Lanka that enrolled a total of 216 patients without established CVD. The trial compared a Polypill (75 mg aspirin, 20 mg simvastatin, 10 mg lisinopril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) to Standard Practice. After randomization, patients were followed monthly for three months. Pre-specified primary outcomes included reduction in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and estimated 10-year CVD risk. We also evaluated the recruitment process and acceptability of the Polypill by both physicians and patients. Patients were recruited in a six-month period as planned. Two hundred three patients (94.0%) completed the treatment program and returned for their three-month follow-up visits. No safety concerns were reported. These findings suggest a high rate of patient acceptability, a finding that is bolstered by the majority of patients completing the trial (90%) indicating that they would take the Polypill "for life" if proven to be effective in reducing CVD risk. Approximately 86% of the physicians surveyed agreed with and supported use of the Polypill for primary prevention and 93% for secondary prevention of CVD. Both the Polypill and Standard Practice resulted in marked reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and 10-year risk of CVD. However, the differences between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. We successfully completed a Polypill feasibility trial in Sri Lanka. We were able to document high acceptability of the Polypill to patients and physicians. We were unable to estimate the risk factor reductions on the Polypill because the control group received similar treatment with individual drugs. The Polypill was however simpler and achieved comparable risk factor reductions, highlighting its potential usefulness in the prevention of CVD. NCT00567307. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response, and preclinical safety study of transforaminal epidural etanercept for the treatment of sciatica.  Recent evidence implicates the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor as a major cause of radiculopathy. Yet, whereas open-label studies with systemically delivered tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have yielded positive results, a placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate efficacy. One variable that may have contributed to poor outcomes is low drug levels at the site of nerve inflammation. To date, no studies have evaluated the efficacy or safety of epidurally administered anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study was conducted to evaluate an epidural tumor necrosis factor inhibitor. Twenty-four patients with subacute lumbosacral radiculopathy were randomly assigned to receive two transforaminal epidural injections of 2, 4, or 6 mg of entanercept 2 weeks apart in successive groups of eight. In each group, two patients received epidural saline. A parallel epidural canine safety study was conducted using the same injection doses and paradigm as in the clinical study. The animal and human safety studies revealed no behavioral, neurologic, or histologic evidence of drug-related toxicity. In the clinical arm, significant improvements in leg and back pain were collectively noted for the etanercept-treated patients, but not for the saline group, one month after treatment. One patient in the saline group (17%), six patients in the 2-mg group (100%), and four patients each in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups (67%) reported at least 50% reduction in leg pain and a positive global perceived effect one month after treatment. Six months after treatment, the beneficial effects persisted in all but one patient. Epidural entanercept holds promise as a treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Low- and high-dose plant and marine (n-3) fatty acids do not affect plasma inflammatory markers in adults with metabolic syndrome.  Chronic inflammation is considered to play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Various (n-3) fatty acids (FA) have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects, but there is a lack of consensus in this area, particularly in regard to optimal source(s) and dose(s). This study aimed to determine the effects of high and low doses of (n-3) FA from plant and marine sources on plasma inflammatory marker concentrations. One-hundred adults with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a low or high dose of plant- (2.2 or 6.6 g/d α-linolenic acid) or marine- (1.2 or 3.6 g/d EPA and DHA) derived (n-3) FA or placebo for 8 wk, using a parallel arm design (n = 20/arm). Fasting blood samples collected at 0, 4, and 8 wk were analyzed for concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and for cardiovascular risk factors. Baseline concentrations across all 5 groups combined were (mean ± SD) 103 ± 32 ng/L for MCP-1, 1.06 ± 0.56 ng/L for IL-6, and 0.197 ± 0.041 ng/L for sICAM-1. There were no significant differences in 8-wk changes in plasma inflammatory marker concentrations among the 5 groups. Plasma TG and blood pressure decreased significantly more and the LDL cholesterol concentration increased more in the high-dose fish oil group compared to the 8-wk changes in some of the other 4 groups (P ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, no beneficial effects were detected for any of the 3 inflammatory markers investigated in response to (n-3) FA in adults with metabolic syndrome regardless of dose or source.

Input:Long term immunity following a booster dose of the inactivated Japanese Encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®, IC51.  IXIARO (IC51), a recently approved inactivated Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, is immunogenic and safe in a 0/28 days primary immunization schedule. Neutralizing antibody titers decline with time and booster doses are likely needed to enhance persistence of immunity. To assess the effect of a booster dose on neutralizing JE antibody titers for up to 12 months after boostering. In this phase III trial, 198 subjects, who had received primary immunization in a preceding randomized trial, were boosted with IXIARO 15 months after the primary immunization. Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed by plaque-reduction neutralisation test, PRNT. Prior to the booster dose, 69.2% (137/198) of subjects had PRNT50 titers ≥ 1:10. One month after the booster, the rate of subjects with PRNT50 ≥ 1:10 (recognized as a protective titer) was 100%. This rate remained high at 98.5% at 6 and 12 months; GMTs were 22.5 before the booster and 900, 487 and 361 at 1, 6 and 12 months after the booster, respectively. A booster dose of IXIARO at 15 months after primary immunization was highly immunogenic with GMTs >5-fold higher than those seen immediately after primary immunization, and remained at high levels for at least 12 months after the booster.

Input:Patient experience with a new teriparatide delivery device.  To determine functionality and acceptability of a new teriparatide (Forteo, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) delivery device by patients with osteoporosis. This was an eight week, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial. Patients received teriparatide 20 microg/day by subcutaneous injection using a new delivery device. Men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture were stratified to Current User (n = 92) or Not Current User (n = 107) groups. Current Users had used the original delivery device for > or =8 weeks, including uninterrupted use for four weeks before enrollment. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00577863. The primary objective was to detect common complaints (> or =3% for all patients) regarding the functionality and acceptability of the new device. Complaints were categorized as functional (e.g., malfunction), nonfunctional (e.g., size), or user manual. Secondary objectives included questionnaire assessment of preference of the new versus original device, features of the new delivery device, and analysis of adverse events. A total of 31 patients (16%) reported 47 complaints (four functional, 27 nonfunctional, and 16 user manual). There were two common complaints: device size (4.0%) and lack of information on alcohol swabs (3.5%). Overall, patients agreed that the new device was easy to use (99.5%), easy to learn to use (99%), easy to attach a needle (97%), easy to hold while injecting (95%), and that it reduced their reluctance to take injections (90%). Most Current Users (92%) preferred the new delivery device over the original device. Adverse events reported by > or =2% of patients were upper respiratory infection (3.5%), urinary tract infection (2%), influenza (2%), and headache (2%). Limitations include the one-arm study design and the short (eight week) duration of the study. Patients found the new teriparatide delivery device easy to use and Current Users preferred the new delivery device over the original device. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:First clinical application of an actively reversible direct factor IXa inhibitor as an anticoagulation strategy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.  The ideal anticoagulant should prevent ischemic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding. Controlled anticoagulation is possible with the REG1 system, an RNA aptamer pair comprising the direct factor IXa inhibitor RB006 and its active control agent RB007. This phase 2a study included a roll-in group (n=2) treated with REG1 plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors followed by 2 groups randomized 5:1 to REG1 or unfractionated heparin. In group 1 (n=12), RB006 was partially reversed with RB007 after percutaneous coronary intervention and fully reversed 4 hours later. In group 2 (n=12), RB006 was fully reversed with RB007 immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention. Femoral sheaths were removed after complete reversal. Patients were pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel. End points included major bleeding within 48 hours; composite of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization within 14 days; and pharmacodynamic measures. All cases were successful, with final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow and no angiographic thrombotic complications. There were 2 ischemic end points in the REG1 group and 1 in the unfractionated heparin group, with 1 major bleed in the unfractionated heparin group. Median activated clotting time values rose from 151 to 236 seconds after RB006. Administration of the partial RB007 dose reversed anticoagulation to an intermediate activated clotting time value of 186 seconds. Complete reversal with RB007 returned the median activated clotting time value to 144 seconds. Both reversal strategies enabled scheduled femoral sheath removal. This study demonstrates the clinical translation of a novel platform of anticoagulation targeting factor IXa and its active reversal to percutaneous coronary intervention and provides the basis for further investigation.

Input:A Phase III evaluation of immunogenicity and safety of two trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines in US children.  This study (NCT00383123) compared the immunogenicity and safety of 2 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines: Fluarix [GlaxoSmithKline (study vaccine)] and Fluzone [Sanofi Pasteur (control vaccine)] in children 6 months to &lt;18 years. Children, stratified by age and randomized, received either study (N = 2115) or control vaccine (N = 1210) at day 0 (and day 28 for previously unvaccinated children younger than 9 years). Children 6 months to &lt;5 years comprised the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity, whereas the reactogenicity/safety group included all children 6 months to &lt;18 years. The study aimed to demonstrate immunologic noninferiority of study vaccine versus control vaccine. For children 6 months to &lt;5 years, the predefined noninferiority criteria were not reached, mainly due to the differences in immune response in children 6 months to &lt;3 years with no influenza vaccination history. All reactogenicity/safety endpoints were within the same range in both vaccine groups. The study vaccine demonstrated a good safety and reactogenicity profile; however, it did not meet the predefined noninferiority criteria in children 6 months to &lt;5 years. The study vaccine was as immunogenic as the control vaccine in children aged 3 to &lt;5 years. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Efficacy and safety of briakinumab vs. etanercept and placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  The anti-interleukin-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody briakinumab has been shown in a phase II study to be effective psoriasis treatment. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of briakinumab compared with etanercept and placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In this phase III, 12-week study (M10-114, NCT00691964), 347 patients were randomized in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio to receive 200 mg briakinumab at weeks 0 and 4 followed by 100 mg briakinumab at week 8 (n = 138); 50 mg of etanercept twice weekly 3-4 days apart at weeks 0-11 (n = 141); or placebo injections matching active treatment (n = 68). The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0/1 at week 12, and the proportion of patients achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at week 12. Of the briakinumab-treated patients, 71·0% achieved a PGA of 0/1 at week 12 as compared with 39·7% of etanercept-treated patients and 2·9% of placebo-treated patients, (P &lt; 0·001, for both comparisons). Of the briakinumab-treated patients 81·9% achieved a PASI 75 response at week 12 as compared with 56·0% of etanercept-treated and 7·4% of placebo-treated patients (P &lt; 0·001, for both comparisons). Serious adverse event rates were reported in four (2·9%) patients receiving briakinumab, one (0·7%) patient receiving etanercept and one (1·5%) placebo-treated patient. In patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, briakinumab had superior efficacy to both placebo and etanercept at 12 weeks as administered in this study. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:The response of gamma vitamin E to varying dosages of alpha vitamin E plus vitamin C.  Vitamin E has been studied extensively in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Cross-sectional population studies as well as randomized controlled intervention trials have demonstrated conflicting results. A recent meta-analysis of these trials has emphasized the ineffectiveness of vitamin E in atherosclerosis prevention, with a possibility of harm at higher dosages. However, vitamin E has several isomers, with the alpha form being available via dietary supplements and the gamma form being available via dietary foodstuffs. The gamma form of vitamin E demonstrates several superior properties (such as trapping reactive nitrogen species and detoxifying nitrogen dioxide) compared with alpha vitamin E. All clinical trials have used the alpha isomer, with little concern that this isomer of vitamin E may actually suppress the gamma isomer of vitamin E. We undertook a dose-response study in volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus to include all the dosages of alpha vitamin E that have been used in cardiovascular prevention trials to determine the effect of alpha vitamin E on gamma vitamin E. We also assessed the effect of alpha vitamin E on several traditional markers of atherosclerotic risk. We added vitamin C to the vitamin E because several clinical trials included this vitamin to enhance the antioxidant effects of alpha vitamin E. Volunteers received, in randomized order for a 2-week period, one of the following vitamin dosage arms: (1) no vitamins, (2) low-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, (3) medium-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, and (4) high-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C. Blood levels of both alpha and gamma vitamin E were measured as well as surrogate markers of oxidative stress, hypercoagulation, and inflammation during a high-fat atherogenic meal (to increase the ambient oxidative stress level during the study). The results demonstrate that alpha vitamin E levels increased in proportion to the dose administered. However, at every dose of alpha vitamin E, gamma vitamin E concentration was significantly suppressed. No beneficial changes in surrogate markers of atherosclerosis were observed, consistent with the negative results of prospective clinical trials using alpha vitamin E. Our results suggest that all prospective cardiovascular clinical trials that used vitamin E supplementation actually suppressed the beneficial antioxidant gamma isomer of vitamin E. No beneficial effects on several potential cardiovascular risk factors were observed, even when the vitamin E was supplemented with vitamin C. If a standardized preparation of gamma vitamin E (without the alpha isomer) becomes available, the effects of gamma vitamin E on atherosclerotic risk will warrant additional studies.

Input:Treatment with 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor VIA-2291 (Atreleuton) in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome.  Production of leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) has been linked to unstable atherosclerotic plaques and cardiovascular events. VIA-2291 is a potent 5-LO inhibitor. In a double-blinded study, 191 patients were randomly assigned 3 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome to receive 25, 50, or 100 mg VIA-2291 or placebo daily for 12 weeks. The primary study end point, whole blood stimulated leukotriene LTB4 at trough drug level, was reduced in all VIA-2291 groups (P&lt;0.0001) in a dose-dependent fashion, with approximately 80% inhibition in >90% of patients in the 100-mg group. A significant reduction of urine leukotriene LTE4 was obtained in all dose groups. No serious adverse events were considered related to study drug. A subset of 93 patients who had undergone a 64-slice coronary CT examination at baseline continued on study medication for a total of 24 weeks and underwent a repeat scan. Five of these patients withdrew or were noncompliant and 28 had nonevaluable scans. Among the 60 remaining patients, new coronary plaques were observed in 5 of 18 (27.8%) placebo-treated patients and in 2 of 42 (4.8%) VIA-2291-treated patients (P=0.01). A reduction in noncalcified plaque volume at 24 weeks versus placebo was observed in VIA-2291-treated groups in the 34 of these 60 patients in whom this end point was analyzable (P&lt;0.01). VIA-2291 reduces leukotriene production at 12 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome. Preliminary data from the CT substudy suggest that such a reduction in leukotriene production may influence atherosclerosis; however, this requires confirmation in a larger study.

Input:Efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in advanced biliary-tract cancers and correlation of changes in 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET with clinical outcome: a phase 2 study.  Previous phase 2 studies have shown antitumour activity with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in patients with advanced biliary-tract cancers (BTCs). In this phase 2 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of combined bevacizumab with GEMOX (GEMOX-B) in patients with advanced BTCs, and investigated how changes in 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET correlate with clinical outcome. Patients with advanced measurable BTCs were given the following treatment on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle: bevacizumab 10 mg/kg, followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) (10 mg/m(2) per min) and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) (2-h infusion). [(18)F]FDG-PET scans were obtained at baseline and after completion of the second cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Efficacy and safety analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00361231. 35 patients were enrolled and evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI 5.3-10.3), and PFS at 6 months was 63% (47-79), which was below the targeted rate of 70%. Grade 3-4 toxic effects included neutropenia (n=7), raised alanine aminotransferase concentrations (n=5), peripheral neuropathy (n=5), and hypertension (n=5). [(18)F]FDG-PET scans showed a significant decrease in maximum standardised uptake value (SUV(max)) after two cycles of treatment (5.72 [SD 2.01] at baseline; 3.73 [SD 1.88] after two cycles; p&lt;0.0001). These changes were more pronounced in patients with partial response or stable disease than those with progressive disease (24 patients, -2.80 [SD 1.95] vs five patients, 1.41 [SD 3.13]; p=0.009). Change in SUV(max) was a significant predictor of PFS (HR 1.35, 1.14-1.60, p=0.0006) and overall survival (1.25, 1.05-1.50, p=0.01). GEMOX-B showed antitumour activity with tolerable safety in patients with advanced BTCs. Decreases in SUV(max) on [(18)F]FDG-PET scans after treatment were associated with disease control and increases in PFS and overall survival. Genentech Oncology and Sanofi-Aventis.

Input:Nuts as a replacement for carbohydrates in the diabetic diet.  Fat intake, especially monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), has been liberalized in diabetic diets to preserve HDL cholesterol and improve glycemic control, yet the exact sources have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we assessed the effect of mixed nut consumption as a source of vegetable fat on serum lipids and HbA(1c) in type 2 diabetes. A total of 117 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomized to one of three treatments for 3 months. Supplements were provided at 475 kcal per 2,000-kcal diet as mixed nuts (75 g/day), muffins, or half portions of both. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c). The relative increase in MUFAs was 8.7% energy on the full-nut dose compared with muffins. Using an intention-to-treat analysis (n = 117), full-nut dose (mean intake 73 g/day) reduced HbA(1c) (-0.21% absolute HbA(1c) units, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11, P &lt; 0.001) with no change after half-nut dose or muffin. Full-nut dose was significantly different from half-nut dose (P = 0.004) and muffin (P = 0.001), but no difference was seen between half-nut dose and muffins. LDL cholesterol also decreased significantly after full-nut dose compared with muffin. The LDL cholesterol reduction after half-nut dose was intermediate and not significantly different from the other treatments. Apolipoprotein (apo) B and the apoB:apoA1 ratio behaved similarly. Nut intake related negatively to changes in HbA(1c) (r = -0.20, P = 0.033) and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.24, P = 0.011). Two ounces of nuts daily as a replacement for carbohydrate foods improved both glycemic control and serum lipids in type 2 diabetes. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Efficacy and safety of losartan in children with Alport syndrome--results from a subgroup analysis of a prospective, randomized, placebo- or amlodipine-controlled trial.  No prospective, randomized, double-blind trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have previously been reported in adults or children with proteinuria secondary to Alport syndrome. This 12-week, double-blind multinational study investigated the effects of losartan 0.7-1.4 mg/kg/day compared with placebo (normotensive patients) or amlodipine 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day up to 5 mg/day (hypertensive patients) on proteinuria [early morning-void urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPr/Cr), baseline ≥ 34 mg/mmol] in 30 children of up to 17 years of age with Alport syndrome. Twelve weeks of treatment with losartan significantly reduced proteinuria compared with placebo/amlodipine: losartan -14.7 mg/mmol (interquartile range -49.7 to -5.7 mg/mmol) or 31.6% reduction using a mixed model approach versus placebo/amlodipine 2.3 mg/mmol (-26.0 to 18.1 mg/mmol), P = 0.01 or 2.3% increase using a mixed model approach. Adverse event incidence was low and comparable between losartan and placebo/amlodipine groups. Losartan significantly lowered proteinuria and was well tolerated after 12 weeks of treatment in children aged 1-17 years with proteinuria secondary to Alport syndrome with or without hypertension, a population that has not previously been rigorously studied.

Input:Long-term up to 24-month efficacy and safety of concomitant prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters and simvastatin in hypertriglyceridemic patients.  Assess the long-term efficacy and safety of prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (P-OM3) coadministered with simvastatin in an extension of the Combination of Prescription Omega-3 Plus Simvastatin (COMBOS) trial. COMBOS included hypertriglyceridemic patients (triglyceride [TG] >or=200 mg/dL and &lt;500 mg/dL or >or=2.26 mmol/L and &lt;5.64 mmol/L) with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level no greater than 10% above the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III treatment goal. After an 8-week lead-in phase with simvastatin 40 mg/day (which continued throughout the trial), subjects were randomized to 8 weeks of P-OM3 4 g/day or placebo. Completers were eligible to participate in a 24-month extension study. Those who received placebo + simvastatin in COMBOS switched to open-label P-OM3 + simvastatin ('Switchers'); those who received P-OM3 + simvastatin during COMBOS continued the same regimen (open-label) in the extension phase ('Non-switchers'). The primary endpoint was the difference between Non-switchers and Switchers in median percent change in non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) from COMBOS end of treatment to Month 4 of the extension phase. At Month 4 from COMBOS end of treatment, non-HDL-C was reduced by a median of 9.4% in Switchers and increased by 0.9% in Non-switchers (p &lt; 0.001). For the total population (combined Non-switcher + Switcher population), the median percent change from COMBOS baseline to Months 4, 12, and 24 was -8.3%, -7.3%, and -8.9%, respectively (all p &lt; 0.001). This extension study revealed no unexpected safety findings. A limitation of this study was a gap between completion of COMBOS and enrollment in the extension phase for some patients; however, a post-hoc non-HDL-C sensitivity analysis performed at the 4-month primary endpoint revealed no influence of gap on study results. In this 24-month extension study, P-OM3 was generally well tolerated, and produced sustained reductions in non-HDL-C levels in simvastatin-treated patients with TG levels between 200 and 500 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L and 5.64 mmol/L).

Input:Randomized controlled trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin abscesses in patients at risk for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.  Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is now the leading cause of uncomplicated skin abscesses in the United States, and the role of antibiotics is controversial. We evaluate whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces the rate of treatment failures during the 7 days after incision and drainage and whether it reduces new lesion formation within 30 days. In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized adults to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo after uncomplicated abscess incision and drainage. Using emergency department rechecks at 2 and 7 days and telephone follow-up, we assessed treatment failure within 7 days, and using clinical follow-up, telephone follow-up, and medical record review, we recorded the development of new lesions within 30 days. We randomized 212 patients, and 190 (90%) were available for 7-day follow-up. We observed a statistically similar incidence of treatment failure in patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (15/88; 17%) versus placebo (27/102; 26%), difference 9%, 95% confidence interval -2% to 21%; P=.12. On 30-day follow-up (successful in 69% of patients), we observed fewer new lesions in the antibiotic (4/46; 9%) versus placebo (14/50; 28%) groups, difference 19%, 95% confidence interval 4% to 34%, P=.02. After the incision and drainage of uncomplicated abscesses in adults, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does not reduce treatment failure but may decrease the formation of subsequent lesions.

Input:Early intervention during imatinib therapy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: a study of the Spanish PETHEMA group.  Despite the favorable results of imatinib front line in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia there is room for improvement. Early intervention during imatinib therapy was undertaken in 210 adults with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia less than three months from diagnosis (Sokal high risk: 16%). Patients received imatinib 400 mg/day. At three months, dose was increased if complete hematologic response was not achieved. At six months, patients in complete cytogenetic response were kept on 400 mg and the remainder randomized to higher imatinib dose or 400 mg plus interferon-alfa. At 18 months, randomized patients were switched to a 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor if not in complete cytogenetic response and imatinib dose increased in non-randomized patients not in major molecular response. Seventy-two percent of patients started imatinib within one month from diagnosis. Median follow-up is 50.5 (range: 1.2-78) months. At three months 4 patients did not have complete hematologic response; at six months 73.8% were in complete cytogenetic response; among the remainder, 9 could not be randomized (toxicity or consent withdrawal), 17 were assigned to high imatinib dose, and 15 to 400 mg + interferon-alpha. The low number of randomized patients precluded comparison between the two arms. Cumulative response at three years was: complete hematologic response 98.6%, complete cytogenetic response 90% and major molecular response 82%. On an intention-to-treat basis, complete cytogenetic response was 78.8% at 18 months. At five years, survival was 97.5%, survival free from accelerated/blastic phase 94.3%, failure free survival 82.5%, and event free survival (including permanent imatinib discontinuation) 71.5%. These results indicate the benefit of early intervention during imatinib therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00390897). Output:</span></div></div>

Input:A phase II, open-label study of the efficacy and safety of imiquimod in the treatment of superficial and mixed infantile hemangioma.  To explore the efficacy and safety of imiquimod 5% cream as a treatment for infantile hemangioma. Phase II, open-label, noncomparative study of imiquimod applied during 16 weeks, with posttherapy follow-up 16 weeks later (8 months total). Outpatient pediatric tertiary care referral center in Quebec, Canada. Healthy infants up to 8.8 months of age with previously untreated, nonulcerated, proliferative superficial or mixed infantile hemangioma, excluding periorbital, or perineal localization, > or =100 cm2 in size. Topical imiquimod applied three to seven times per week for 16 weeks to infantile hemangioma. Lesion area, volume, depth (Doppler ultrasound), and color (erythema), serum drug, and interferon-alpha levels. Sixteen infants (11 girls, 5 boys) with a mean age at entry of 4.1 months and mean lesion area of 32.89 cm2, and volume of 39.98 cm3 were enrolled. Two participants discontinued treatment early, one for an adverse event (crying upon application), the other because of the lack of compliance. Local skin reactions were consistent with those reported in adults. Two cases had a decrease and three had an increase in lesion parameters; otherwise no meaningful changes in lesion area, volume, or depth were observed. At the 4-month posttreatment visit, 11 of 14 subjects had improvement in erythema (marginal homogeneity test = 2.668, p = 0.008). Measured serum drug and interferon-alpha levels were low or undetectable.

Input:Effect of 12 months of whole-body vibration therapy on bone density and structure in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial.  Although data from studies in animals demonstrated beneficial effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy on bone, clinical trials in postmenopausal women showed conflicting results. To determine whether WBV improves bone density and structure. A 12-month, single-center, superiority, randomized, controlled trial with 3 parallel groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00420940) Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada. 202 healthy postmenopausal women with bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5 who were not receiving prescription bone medications. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (1:1:1 ratio) by using a block-randomization scheme and sealed envelopes. They were asked to stand on a low-magnitude (0.3g) 90-Hz or 30-Hz WBV platform for 20 minutes daily or to serve as control participants; all participants received calcium and vitamin D. Bone outcome assessors, who were blinded to group assignment, determined trabecular volumetric BMD and other measurements of the distal tibia and distal radius with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and areal BMD with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at 12 months. 12 months of WBV therapy had no significant effect on any bone outcomes compared with no WBV therapy. For the primary outcome of tibial trabecular volumetric BMD, mean change from baseline was 0.4 mg/cm(3) (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.2 mg/cm(3)) in the 90-Hz WBV group, -0.1 mg/cm(3) (CI, -1.0 to 0.8 mg/cm(3)) in the 30-Hz WBV group, and -0.2 mg/cm(3) (CI, -1.1 to 0.6 mg/cm(3)) in the control group (P = 0.55). Changes in areal BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine were also similar among the groups. Overall, low-magnitude WBV at both 90 and 30 Hz was well-tolerated. Adherence to WBV ranged from 65% to 79%. Double-blinding was not possible. Whole-body vibration therapy at 0.3g and 90 or 30 Hz for 12 months did not alter BMD or bone structure in postmenopausal women who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

Input:Montelukast as add-on therapy with inhaled corticosteroids alone or inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-2-agonists in the management of patients diagnosed with asthma and concurrent allergic rhinitis (the RADAR trial).  To evaluate the effectiveness of montelukast as add-on therapy for patients diagnosed with asthma and concurrent allergic rhinitis who remain uncontrolled while receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or ICS/long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA) therapy in a community practice setting. An eight-week, multicentre, open-label, observational study. Patients were 15 years of age or older and, while treated with an ICS or ICS/LABA, had allergic rhinitis and uncontrolled asthma symptoms by at least two criteria as per the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with controlled asthma symptoms after eight weeks of treatment with montelukast 10 mg once daily added to ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. In total, 1004 patients participated in the survey phase of the study. Of these patients, 319 continued in the treatment phase and 301 (94.4%) completed the eight-week assessment. At baseline, all patients had uncontrolled asthma symptoms based on the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines; at the eight-week assessment, 229 patients (76.1%) achieved asthma control. According to the Asthma Control Questionnaire (as determined by scores of 0.75 or less), 164 patients (54.7%) achieved well-controlled asthma at week 8. The mean (+/- SD) Asthma Control Questionnaire score decreased from 2.03+/-0.80 to 0.92+/-0.80 (P&lt;0.001) for all patients, representing a clinically significant improvement. A statistically and clinically significant reduction in the overall Mini Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score was achieved with a decrease from 2.57+/-1.20 to 1.12+/-1.00 (-1.45+/-1.35; P&lt;0.001). Patient and physician satisfaction rates with montelukast add-on therapy were also significantly increased when compared with baseline treatment. Montelukast add-on therapy is effective for managing asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms in patients who were previously uncontrolled with ICS or ICS/LABA treatment. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Phase 1 multicenter dose-escalation study of ezatiostat hydrochloride (TLK199 tablets), a novel glutathione analog prodrug, in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.  Phase 1 testing of ezatiostat, a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome was conducted in a multidose-escalation study. Patients received 10 dose levels (200, 400, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 mg) of ezatiostat tablets in divided doses on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles. The safety and pharmacokinetics of ezatiostat were evaluated. Forty-five patients with low to intermediate-2 International Prognostic Scoring System risk myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common grade 1 or 2, respectively, treatment-related adverse events were nonhematologic: nausea (56%, 9%), diarrhea (36%, 7%), vomiting (24%, 7%), abdominal pain (9%, 0%), constipation (4%, 9%), anorexia (3%, 7%), and dyspepsia (3%, 7%). Concentration of the primary active metabolite, TLK236, increased proportionate to ezatiostat dosage. Seventeen hematologic improvement (HI) responses by International Working Group criteria were observed at dose levels of 200 to 6000 mg/day with 11 HI responses at doses of 4000 to 6000 mg/day. HI responses occurred in all lineages including 3 bilineage and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Decreased number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions and in some cases transfusion independence were attained. Extended dose schedules of ezatiostat tablets are under investigation.

Input:Efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 54-week study.  To assess the 54-week efficacy of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and pioglitazone, compared with pioglitazone monotherapy, and to assess safety in these groups during the 30 weeks after the dosage of pioglitazone was increased from 30 to 45 mg/day, in drug-naÏve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8-12%]. Following a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (Sitagliptin Protocol 064, Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00397631; Yoon KH, Shockey GR, Teng R et al. Effect of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and pioglitazone on glycaemic control and measures of beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Int J Clin Pract 2011; 65: 154-164) in which patients were treated with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg/day and pioglitazone 30 mg/day or monotherapy with pioglitazone 30 mg/day, patients entered a 30-week extension study. In the extension study, the pioglitazone dose was increased from 30 to 45 mg/day in both groups. Depending upon treatment allocation, patients took one tablet of sitagliptin 100 mg or matching placebo daily. Pioglitazone was administered in an open-label fashion as a single 45-mg tablet taken once daily. Patients not meeting specific glycaemic goals in the extension study were rescued with metformin therapy. Efficacy and safety results for the extension study excluded data after initiation of rescue therapy. Of the 520 patients initially randomized, 446 completed the base study and, of these, 317 entered the extension. In this extension study cohort, the mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the end of the base study (week 24) were -2.5% and -62.1 mg/dl with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg versus -1.9% and -48.7 mg/dl with pioglitazone monotherapy. At the end of the extension study (week 54), the mean reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was -2.4% with the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 45 mg versus -1.9% with pioglitazone monotherapy [between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.5% (-0.8, -0.3)] and the mean reduction in FPG was -61.3 mg/dl versus -52.8 mg/dl, respectively [between-group difference (95% CI) = -8.5 mg/dl (-16.3, -0.7)]. Safety and tolerability of initial treatment with the combination of sitagliptin and pioglitazone and pioglitazone monotherapy were similar. As expected, increases in body weight from baseline were observed in both treatment groups at week 54: 4.8 and 4.1 kg in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively [between-group difference (95% CI) = 0.7 kg (-0.7, 2.1)]. In this study, initial combination therapy with sitagliptin 100 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg increased to 45 mg after 24 weeks led to a substantial and durable incremental improvement in glycaemic control compared with initial treatment with pioglitazone monotherapy during a 54-week treatment period. Both initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and pioglitazone and pioglitazone monotherapy were generally well tolerated (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01028391). Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Efficacy and tolerability of aliskiren 300  mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25  mg (± amlodipine 5  mg) in hypertensive patients not controlled by candesartan 32  mg plus HCT 25  mg.  The majority of patients with essential hypertension of moderate severity (WHO grade 2) require combination therapy. We aimed to investigate whether the single-pill combination of aliskiren 300  mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 25  mg (ALIS 300/HCT 25) improves the BP reduction in hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by the free combination of candesartan 32  mg and HCT 25  mg (CAN 32 + HCT 25). In an open-label, single-arm study, patients with mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100-109  mmHg at baseline received 4-week treatment with CAN 32 + HCT 25 (Phase 1), followed - in patients whose BP was not controlled - by 4-week treatment with ALIS 300/HCT 25 (Phase 2). The DBP change between weeks 4 and 8 was the primary endpoint. The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT00867490. In the 186 patients treated, CAN 32 + HCT 25 reduced systolic BP (SBP)/DBP by 18.9/12.2 mmHg. Those 123 patients with uncontrolled hypertension switched to ALIS 300/HCT 25 experienced a further SBP/DBP reduction of 2.8/3.1  mmHg between week 4 and week 8 (p = 0.0064 and p &lt; 0.0001), and 33.3% achieved DBP normalisation. In 61 patients not controlled after week 8 (SBP ≥ 140  mmHg or DBP  ≥  90  mmHg), who participated in an optional study extension, amlodipine 5  mg was added. Triple therapy over 4 weeks decreased SBP/DBP by further 9.2/5.9  mmHg (p &lt; 0.0001 each). Adverse events with suspected drug relationship were noted in 4.3% (Phase 1), 3.3% (Phase 2), and 1.6% (extension) of the patients. Limitations of the study include the open-label, non-randomised approach and short treatment duration across the individual phases. In this open-label, single-arm switch study reflecting clinical practice, patients with moderate hypertension not controlled by the free combination of CAN 32 + HCT 25 achieved a clinically and statistically significant reduction of blood pressure from the single pill combination of ALIS 300/HCT 25, and the optional addition of amlodipine.

Input:Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders: a randomized, controlled trial.  Children with autism spectrum disorders often present with comorbid anxiety disorders that cause significant functional impairment. This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with this profile. A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction. Forty children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a 3-month waitlist (36 completed treatment or waitlist). Therapists worked with individual families. The CBT model emphasized behavioral experimentation, parent-training, and school consultation. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews and parents and children completed anxiety symptom checklists at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. In intent-to-treat analyses, 78.5% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 8.7% of the waitlist group. CBT also outperformed the waitlist on diagnostic outcomes and parent reports of child anxiety, but not children's self-reports. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. The CBT manual employed in this study is one of the first adaptations of an evidence-based treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders. Remission of anxiety disorders appears to be an achievable goal among high-functioning children with autism. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous IgPro20 in patients with primary immunodeficiency.  Immunoglobulin replacement is a standard therapy for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulin offers more constant IgG levels than intravenous administration and simplifies administration for some patients. Use of L-proline as an excipient contributes to the stability of highly concentrated IgG preparations. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IgPro20 (Hizentra®), a new 20% subcutaneous IgG solution, and compare the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) with that of a similar intravenous 10% IgG solution (IgPro10; Privigen®). At the request of the US FDA, an algorithm for determining IgG trough level ratios (TLRs) was developed in order to provide physicians with a practical tool for monitoring doses during steady-state IgPro20 therapy. This was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase III clinical trial conducted in the US. The study was performed in a primary-care setting. Eligible patients were males or females aged 6-75 years with a primary immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency or X-linked agammaglobulinaemia) who had received regular treatment with IgPro10 for at least 3 months prior to entering this study and had achieved serum trough concentration (C(trough)) values ≥5 g/L. IgPro20 was administered subcutaneously once weekly at initial doses equivalent to 130% of patients' previous doses, based on the results obtained in a Vivaglobin® study and due to an FDA request. After run-in, each patient's dose was adjusted to achieve an AUC comparable to that achieved with IgPro10 administered intravenously. Eighteen patients completed the study. Mean IgPro20 : IgPro10 dose ratio (dose adjustment coefficient) was 1.53 (range 1.26-1.87). The resulting mean AUCs were 105.6 g · day/L for IgPro20 versus 103.2 g · day/L for IgPro10 (geometric mean ratio 1.002; lower one-sided 95% confidence limit [CL] 0.951). Thus, the primary endpoint of the study was met, as this result exceeded the pre-specified criterion of the lower one-sided 95% CL of ≥0.8 for non-inferiority. At these AUCs, which were considered equivalent, the mean IgPro20 : IgPro10 TLR, determined by the developed algorithm, was 1.29 (range 1.18-1.73). Titres of specific antibodies tested were well above respective product specifications, suggesting that protection against infection would be effective. Steady-state AUCs with subcutaneous IgPro20 and intravenous IgPro10 were equivalent. Mean dose adjustment coefficient and mean TLR can be used for initial dose conversion without risk of under-protection but vary too widely to be considered measures of equivalence. Trial registration number (clinicaltrials.gov): NCT00419341. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and costs associated with intraperitoneal versus subcutaneous insulin administration in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.  To investigate the effects of continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) compared with subcutaneous insulin on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and treatment satisfaction, and to perform a cost analysis in type 1 diabetes. We used an open-label, prospective, crossover, randomized, 16-month study (N = 24). HRQOL and patient satisfaction were assessed with questionnaires (the 36-item short-form health survey [SF-36], the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5], and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire [DTSQ]). Direct costs of CIPII and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were compared. Questionnaire scores were higher with CIPII than with subcutaneous therapy. Yearly direct pump- and procedure-associated costs for CIPII were estimated at 10,910 euroscompared with 4,810 euros for CSII. Apart from improving glycemic control, CIPII improved HRQOL and treatment satisfaction compared with subcutaneous insulin. Direct pump- and procedure-associated costs are considerably higher for CIPII, however. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Harnessing naturally occurring tumor immunity: a clinical vaccine trial in prostate cancer.  Studies of patients with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) have revealed that apoptotic tumor serves as a potential potent trigger for the initiation of naturally occurring tumor immunity. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. We have modeled PND tumor immunity in a clinical trial in which apoptotic allogeneic prostate tumor cells were used to generate an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Twenty-four prostate cancer patients were immunized in a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated. Importantly, we also found that the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, with no effect on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. A statistically significant increase in T cell proliferation responses to prostate tumor cells in vitro (p = 0.002), decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) slope (p = 0.016), and a two-fold increase in PSA doubling time (p = 0.003) were identified when we compared data before and after vaccination. An apoptotic cancer cell vaccine modeled on naturally occurring tumor immune responses in PND patients provides a safe and immunogenic tumor vaccine. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00289341.

Input:Roflumilast in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with longacting bronchodilators: two randomised clinical trials.  Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2-127, and NCT00424268 for M2-128. In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal. Roflumilast improves lung function in patients with COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium, and could become an important treatment for these patients. Nycomed. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Effect on gastric function and symptoms of drinking wine, black tea, or schnapps with a Swiss cheese fondue: randomised controlled crossover trial.  To compare the effects of drinking white wine or black tea with Swiss cheese fondue followed by a shot of cherry schnapps on gastric emptying, appetite, and abdominal symptoms. Randomised controlled crossover study. 20 healthy adults (14 men) aged 23-58. Cheese fondue (3260 kJ, 32% fat) labelled with 150 mg sodium (13)Carbon-octanoate was consumed with 300 ml of white wine (13%, 40 g alcohol) or black tea in randomised order, followed by 20 ml schnapps (40%, 8 g alcohol) or water in randomised order. Cumulative percentage dose of (13)C substrate recovered over four hours (higher values indicate faster gastric emptying) and appetite and dyspeptic symptoms (visual analogue scales). Gastric emptying was significantly faster when fondue was consumed with tea or water than with wine or schnapps (cumulative percentage dose of (13)C recovered 18.1%, 95% confidence interval 15.2% to 20.9% v 7.4%, 4.6% to 10.3%; P&lt;0.001). An inverse dose-response relation between alcohol intake and gastric emptying was evident. Appetite was similar with consumption of wine or tea (difference 0.11, -0.12 to 0.34; P=0.35), but reduced if both wine and schnapps were consumed (difference -0.40, -0.01 to -0.79; P&lt;0.046). No difference in dyspeptic symptoms was present. Gastric emptying after a Swiss cheese fondue is noticeably slower and appetite suppressed if consumed with higher doses of alcohol. This effect was not associated with dyspeptic symptoms. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00943696. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:A randomized controlled trial of preschool-based joint attention intervention for children with autism.  Deficits in joint attention (JA) and joint engagement (JE) represent a core problem in young children with autism as these affect language and social development. Studies of parent-mediated and specialist-mediated JA-intervention suggest that such intervention may be effective. However, there is little knowledge about the success of the intervention when done in preschools. Assess the effects of a preschool-based JA-intervention. 61 children (48 males) with autistic disorder (29-60 months) were randomized to either 8 weeks of JA-intervention, in addition to their preschool programs (n = 34), or to preschool programs only (n = 27). The intervention was done by preschool teachers with weekly supervision by trained counselors from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinics (CAMHC). Changes in JA and JE were measured by blinded independent testers using Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS) and video taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child play at baseline and post-intervention. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00378157. Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant difference between the intervention and the control group, with the intervention group yielding more JA initiation during interaction with the preschool teachers. The effect generalized to significantly longer duration of JE with the mothers. This is the first randomized study to show positive and generalized effects of preschool-based JA-intervention.

Input:Prognostic relevance of 18-F FDG PET/CT in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated with up-front autologous transplantation.  We prospectively analyzed the prognostic relevance of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) at diagnosis, after thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) induction therapy and double autotransplantation (ASCT) in 192 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Presence at baseline of at least 3 focal lesions (FLs; 44% of cases), a standardized uptake value (SUV) > 4.2 (46%), and extramedullary disease (EMD; 6%) adversely affected 4-year estimates of progression-free survival (PFS; ≥ 3 FLs: 50%; SUV > 4.2: 43%; presence of EMD: 28%). SUV > 4.2 and EMD were also correlated with shorter overall survival (OS; 4-year rates: 77% and 66%, respectively). Persistence of SUV > 4.2 after TD induction was an early predictor for shorter PFS. Three months after ASCT, PET/CT was negative in 65% of patients whose 4-year rates of PFS and OS were superior to those of PET-positive patients (PFS: 66% and OS: 89%). In a multivariate analysis, both EMD and SUV > 4.2 at baseline and persistence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake after ASCT were independent variables adversely affecting PFS. PET/CT involvement at diagnosis, after novel agent-based induction and subsequent ASCT is a reliable predictor of prognosis in MM patients. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NTC01341262. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Efficacy and safety of a double-coated paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent: the EUCATAX trial.  The aim of this study was the comparison of a new double-coated paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent with bare-metal stent (BMS) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Stent coating with biodegradable polymers as a platform for elution of drugs has the potential for complete elution of drugs and for decreasing the risk of late complications. Multicenter randomized trial comparing a paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) coated with a biodegradable polymer and glycocalyx with the equivalent BMS. We randomly assigned 422 patients with de novo coronary lesions to PES (211 patients) or to BMS (211 patients). Primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Clinical secondary end points were target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis (ST), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Angiographic secondary end points were late loss and binary restenosis. At 1 year of follow-up, TVF rate was 9.5% in the PES group and 17.1% in the BMS group (P=0.02), and MACE rate was 10% in PES and 19% in BMS arm (P=0.009). All other secondary end points were reached but ST. ST rate was low and similar in both study arms. The study shows that patients treated with PES with dual coating technology had significantly lower incidence of TVF and MACE than those treated with BMS design; however, longer follow-up should be necessary to assess true advantages of this technology compared with the previous one.

Input:Intradermal influenza vaccine administered using a new microinjection system produces superior immunogenicity in elderly adults: a randomized controlled trial.  Enhanced influenza vaccines are needed to provide improved protection for elderly individuals. The intradermal vaccination route was hypothesized to provide immunogenicity superior to that provided by the intramuscular vaccination route. In a multicenter, randomized study, 1107 volunteers >60 years of age received intradermal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 or 21 microg of hemagglutinin per strain or intramuscular control vaccine. Intradermal vaccines used a novel microinjection system designed to ensure easy, convenient, consistent vaccination. The primary end points of the study were the strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titers (GMTs) noted 21 days after vaccination. Groups were compared using noninferiority and superiority analyses. For each strain, the GMTs noted in association with each intradermal vaccine were superior to those noted with the intramuscular control (adjusted P&lt; .0001). Seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and mean titer increases were also superior for intradermally administered vaccine in all but one of the analyses undertaken. Systemic reactogenicity was comparable between routes. Local injection site reactions, particularly erythema but not pain, were more commonly associated with intradermal vaccination. For the first time, the intradermal vaccination route has been used to elicit immune responses significantly superior to those noted in association with the conventional intramuscular vaccination route. This was done using an easy-to-use, reliable microinjection system. This superior response is expected to enhance annual protection against influenza in this vulnerable population.

Input:Early metabolic response using FDG PET/CT and molecular phenotypes of breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  This study was aimed 1) to investigate the predictive value of FDG PET/CT (fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography) for histopathologic response and 2) to explore the results of FDG PET/CT by molecular phenotypes of breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventy-eight stage II or III breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant docetaxel/doxorubicin chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. FDG PET/CTs were acquired before chemotherapy and after the first cycle of chemotherapy for evaluating early metabolic response. The mean pre- and post-chemotherapy standard uptake value (SUV) were 7.5 and 3.9, respectively. The early metabolic response provided by FDG PET/CT after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with the histopathologic response after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.002). Sensitivity and negative predictive value were 85.7% and 95.1%, respectively. The estrogen receptor negative phenotype had a higher pre-chemotherapy SUV (8.6 vs. 6.4, P = 0.047) and percent change in SUV (48% vs. 30%, P = 0.038). In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the pre-chemotherapy SUV was higher than in non-TNBC (9.8 vs. 6.4, P = 0.008). The early metabolic response using FDG PET/CT could have a predictive value for the assessment of histopathologic non-response of stage II/III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that the initial SUV and the decline in SUV differed based on the molecular phenotype. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Biologic lung volume reduction in advanced upper lobe emphysema: phase 2 results.  Biologic lung volume reduction (BioLVR) is a new endobronchial treatment for advanced emphysema that reduces lung volume through tissue remodeling. Assess the safety and therapeutic dose of BioLVR hydrogel in upper lobe predominant emphysema. Open-labeled, multicenter phase 2 dose-ranging studies were performed with BioLVR hydrogel administered to eight subsegmental sites (four in each upper lobe) involving: (1) low-dose treatment (n = 28) with 10 ml per site (LD); and (2) high-dose treatment (n = 22) with 20 ml per site (HD). Safety was assessed by the incidence of serious medical complications. Efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in pulmonary function tests, dyspnea score, 6-minute walk distance, and health-related quality of life. After treatment there were no deaths and four serious treatment-related complications. A reduction in residual volume to TLC ratio at 12 weeks (primary efficacy outcome) was achieved with both LD (-6.4 +/- 9.3%; P = 0.002) and HD (-5.5 +/- 9.4%; P = 0.028) treatments. Improvements in pulmonary function in HD (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +15.6%; P = 0.002; DeltaFVC = +9.1%; P = 0.034) were greater than in LD patients (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +6.7%; P = 0.021; DeltaFVC = +5.1%; P = 0.139). LD- and HD-treated groups both demonstrated improved symptom scores and health-related quality of life. BioLVR improves physiology and functional outcomes up to 6 months with an acceptable safety profile in upper lobe predominant emphysema. Overall improvement was greater and responses more durable with 20 ml per site than 10 ml per site dosing. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00435253 and NCT 00515164).

For study 1 we screened 1940 potential participants to enroll 192 participants (89 women and 103 men), mean age 40.0 +/- 9.4 years (range, 21-54 years). For study 2 we screened 1849 potential participants to enroll 240 participants (105 women and 135 men) at least 55 years old (mean, 63.1 +/- 6.7 years). Study 1 randomly assigned participants to 2 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or a wait list control group. Study 2 randomly assigned participants to 6 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or medical care consisting of 3 provider visits for medications. Recruitment source costs and yield, and baseline characteristics of enrolled versus nonparticipants were recorded. We conducted 3789 telephone screens for both trials to enroll 432 (11%) participants, at a cost in excess of $156,000 for recruitment efforts. The cost per call for all callers averaged $41, ranging from $4 to $300 based on recruitment method; for enrolled participants, the cost per call was $361, ranging from $33 to $750. Direct mail efforts accounted for 62% of all callers, 57% for enrolled participants, and had the second lowest cost per call for recruitment efforts. It is important that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research can be successfully conducted at CAM institutions. However, the costs associated with recruitment efforts for studies conducted at CAM institutions may be higher than expected and many self-identified participants are users of the CAM therapy. Therefore, strategies for efficient recruitment methods and targeting nonusers of CAM therapies should be developed early for CAM trials. Output:</span></div></div>

Input:Indacaterol provides 24-hour bronchodilation in COPD: a placebo-controlled blinded comparison with tiotropium.  Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled, once-daily, ultra-long-acting β2-agonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This randomized, double-blind study compared the bronchodilator efficacy of indacaterol with that of placebo and tiotropium in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. In an incomplete-block, multi-dose, three-period, crossover design, patients received three of the following four treatments: indacaterol 150 μg, indacaterol 300 μg, tiotropium 18 μg and placebo, each once-daily for 14 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. Study drug was supplied daily by blinded, third party study personnel to maintain blinding of patients and investigators. The primary efficacy variable was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 24 h post-dose after 14 days. The study was powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of indacaterol to tiotropium for this variable. A total of 169 patients were randomized (mean age 65 years); 153 (90.5%) completed. Trough FEV1 after 14 days with indacaterol 150 μg and 300 μg was statistically and clinically superior to placebo, with differences (95% CI) of 170 (120-220) and 150 (100-200) mL respectively (both p &lt; 0.001). For this endpoint, both doses of indacaterol not only met the criterion for non-inferiority compared with tiotropium, but also achieved numerically higher values, with differences versus tiotropium of 40 and 30 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 μg, respectively. At 5 min post-dose on Day 1, the mean FEV1 for both indacaterol doses was significantly higher than placebo (by 120 and 130 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 μg, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) and tiotropium (by 80 mL for both doses; p &lt; 0.001). Adverse events were reported by similar proportions of patients: 31.4%, 29.5%, 28.3% and 28.5% for indacaterol 150 μg and 300 μg, tiotropium and placebo treatments, respectively. Once-daily indacaterol provided clinically and statistically significant 24-h bronchodilation. Indacaterol was at least as effective as tiotropium, with a faster onset of action (within 5 min) on the first day of dosing. Indacaterol should prove useful in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, for whom treatment with one or more classes of long-acting bronchodilator is recommended.

Input:Comparative effectiveness of goal setting in diabetes mellitus group clinics: randomized clinical trial.  Diabetes mellitus (DM) group clinics can effectively control hypertension, but data to support glycemic control are equivocal. This study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of 2 DM group clinic interventions on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in primary care. Eighty-seven participants were recruited from a DM registry of a single regional Veterans Affairs medical center to participate in an open, randomized comparative effectiveness study. Two primary care-based DM group interventions of 3 months' duration were compared. Empowering Patients in Care (EPIC) was a clinician-led, patient-centered group clinic consisting of 4 sessions on setting self-management action plans (diet, exercise, home monitoring, medications, etc) and communicating about progress with action plans. The comparison intervention consisted of group education sessions with a DM educator and dietician followed by an additional visit with one's primary care provider. Hemoglobin A(1c) levels were compared after intervention and at the 1-year follow-up. Participants in the EPIC intervention had significantly greater improvements in HbA(1c) levels immediately following the active intervention (8.86%-8.04% vs 8.74%-8.70% of total hemoglobin; mean [SD] between-group difference 0.67% [1.3%]; P=.03), and these differences persisted at the 1 year follow-up (0.59% [1.4%], P=.05). A repeated-measures analysis using all study time points found a significant time-by-treatment interaction effect on HbA(1c) levels favoring the EPIC intervention (F(2,85)=3.55; P=.03). The effect of the time-by-treatment interaction seems to be partially mediated by DM self-efficacy (F(1,85)=10.39; P=.002). Primary care-based DM group clinics that include structured goal-setting approaches to self-management can significantly improve HbA(1c) levels after intervention and maintain improvements for 1 year. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00481286. Output:</span></div></div>
