she said.\n\&quot;That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.\n\&quot;Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\&quot;\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\nThe Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.\nHe said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.\n\&quot;I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\&quot; he said.\n\&quot;Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\&quot;\nHe said it was important that \&quot;immediate steps\&quot; were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\nInsp David Gibson said: \&quot;It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\n\&quot;While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Two tourist buses have been destroyed by fire in a suspected arson attack in Belfast city centre.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;40143035&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \&quot;no clear instruction was given on where he should park\&quot;.\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \&quot;did a good job and I didn't\&quot;.\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \&quot;Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\&quot;\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \&quot;I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\&quot;Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\&quot;\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \&quot;Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\&quot;\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \&quot;felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\&quot;, adding: \&quot;We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\&quot;\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session.

Mr Newlin said.\nBy contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\nThe pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\nThe attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\nUsing this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\nThe Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\nWireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\nBastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\nUpdates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\nBut Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;35890902&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Administrators confirmed the redundancies affecting 38 staff at Galashiels-based Murray and Burrell.\nThe business, established in 1928, went into administration last week citing \&quot;adverse trading conditions\&quot;.\nThere are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff.\nThomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner was appointed as administrator at Murray and Burrell on Monday.\nA statement confirmed: \&quot;Directors explored all options in an effort to preserve trading and jobs.\n\&quot;Regrettably, 38 jobs were lost as there is no prospect of continuing to trade.\&quot;\nSouth of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton described it as a \&quot;sad day for the Borders\&quot;.\nHowever, some of the workers laid off could find employment with a Melrose-based company.\nJS Crawford has said that, with several housing projects on its books, it needs staff.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Dozens of jobs have been lost after efforts to save an historic building firm in the Scottish Borders failed.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;37922330&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday.\nThe EC said that its \&quot;preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.\&quot;\nHowever, Amazon said it \&quot;has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg\&quot;.\n\&quot;We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],\&quot;

proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.\nDoubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.\nThe Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether \&quot;Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty\&quot; between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.\n\&quot;If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,\&quot; the EC said.\nIt added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.\nLuxembourg's finance ministry said it \&quot;has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.\&quot;\n\&quot;Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,\&quot;

But it's all over the place.\&quot;\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\&quot;It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\&quot; Mr Hsiung said. \&quot;That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\&quot;But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\&quot;\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\&quot;We don't know yet,\&quot; Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarantulas have evolved almost exactly the same shade of vibrant blue at least eight separate times.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;34944735&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Internet searches from the week before the crash were found on the tablet computer used by Andreas Lubitz,\nMeanwhile, the second \&quot;black box\&quot; flight recorder from the plane has been recovered.\nThere were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March.\nThe German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included \&quot;ways to commit suicide\&quot; and \&quot;cockpit doors and their security provisions\&quot;.\nSpokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: \&quot;He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide.\n\&quot;In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.''\nProsecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March.\nLubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.\nThe first \&quot;black box\&quot;, the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site.\nBased on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit.\nThe second \&quot;black box\&quot; recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.\nAt a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was \&quot;reasonable hope\&quot; the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information.\nThe \&quot;completely blackened\&quot; equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said.\nHe said: \&quot;The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight.\&quot;\nHe told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.\nAs each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said,\nHe added 40 mobile phones had been recovered.

She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \&quot;judicial committee\&quot; is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \&quot;disfellowshipped\&quot;

by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;From when Karen Morgan was 12, until she was well into her teens, she was sexually abused by her uncle - a ministerial servant with the Jehovah's Witnesses.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;33609927&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will \&quot;go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever\&quot;.\nThe German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.\nThe bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures.\nIn a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: \&quot;This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.\&quot;\nAsked how long that would take, he replied: \&quot;It has failed already.\&quot;\nMr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently.\nHe said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign.\n\&quot;We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating.

A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.\&quot;\nHe also said the \&quot;cheerleaders\&quot; for Brexit had shown a \&quot;disregard that amounts to contempt\&quot; towards those that backed the losing side.\nAnd he said the UK would become \&quot;far more dependent\&quot; on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as \&quot;less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors\&quot;.\nSir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that \&quot;uncertainties over border restrictions\&quot; after Brexit were \&quot;a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South\&quot;.\nThe ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to \&quot;face down\&quot; people calling for \&quot;total disengagement\&quot; from Europe.\nBut the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous \&quot;don't bind my hands\&quot; plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now \&quot;seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU\&quot;.\nConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: \&quot;It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Britons are being offered an \&quot;unreal and over-optimistic\&quot; vision of what Brexit will look like, Sir John Major has warned.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;39109408&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour - which is opposing the cap - was \&quot;in denial\&quot; over the state of the economy.\nBut Labour argued the cap would be a \&quot;hit and run\&quot; on working families.\nBenefits have historically risen in line with the rate of inflation.

Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.\nThose for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.\nThe estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is £3.2 billion.\nThey increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.\nDuring lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: \&quot;The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War.\&quot;\nHe added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had \&quot;grown\&quot; in the last few years.\n\&quot;These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,\&quot; Mr Duncan Smith said.\nFor Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.\nBut Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.\nMr Byrne said the government was showing \&quot;contempt\&quot; by trying to \&quot;ram this bill through the House in just one day\&quot;.\nHe added: \&quot;It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it.\&quot;\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said: \&quot;Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?\&quot;\nSarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill \&quot;with a heavy heart\&quot; because it was \&quot;disingenuous\&quot; to try to \&quot;find someone to blame for our own woes\&quot;.\n\&quot;A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,\&quot; she told MPs. \&quot;Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.\n\&quot;It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate.\&quot;\nHowever, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: \&quot;It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work.\&quot;\nDavid Cameron's official spokesman said: \&quot;The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end.\&quot;\nThe BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an \&quot;impact assessment\&quot; published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing £5 a week or about £250 over the three year period.\nThe majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of £3 a week worse off.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The government has urged MPs to back a 1% cap on annual rises in working-age benefits and some tax credits, arguing it is vital to cutting the deficit.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20936833&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday.\nThe disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected.\nThames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed.\nIt said the repair work was \&quot;extremely complex\&quot; and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it.\nDry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top.

Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard.

Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.\nBalotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.\nBalotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.\nSilva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left.

So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\&quot;That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\&quot;\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \&quot;completely eradicate\&quot; the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \&quot;Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\&quot;\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \&quot;zero delays over six weeks\&quot; for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \&quot;real progress\&quot; was being made.\nShe later added: \&quot;Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\&quot;Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\&quot;\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \&quot;We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\&quot;Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\&quot;Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\&quot;\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \&quot;The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\&quot;Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\&quot;Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Labour has accused the Scottish first minister of misleading parliament over hospital bed blocking statistics.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;34352262&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding.\nBut the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area.\nThe Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements.\nThough the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar.\nThe problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date.\nThe pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system.\nWelsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea.\nAt the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws.\nIt includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter.\n2,200\nhectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales\n20,000 waterfowl are supported\n13,590  oystercatchers\n35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck\nThe local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges.\nIt is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills.\nRainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water.\nThe UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020.\nHowever, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted \&quot;too late\&quot;

Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There is a lot of talk that Tim Sherwood is close to being sacked by Aston Villa but I cannot understand why they would even contemplate getting rid of him at this stage of the season.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;34541803&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:46,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Transport Minister Edwina Hart said she also wanted to introduce measures to streamline the system and cut fraud.\nTough new guidelines to tackle abuse, introduced in 2013, were suspended by one council in February 2015.\nNeath Port Talbot council had received complaints that genuine cases were being rejected.\nIt was one of a number of local authorities reporting a big rise in rejections, after being told not to just rely on evidence from GPs.\nA consultation on Welsh ministers' latest proposals has been launched.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The blue badge disabled parking scheme could be extended to people with temporary conditions restricting their mobility.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;35360841&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years.\nBut there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health.\nAnd the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions.\nLife expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013.\nFemale life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages.\nThis comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012.\nThe only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013.\nAmong local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease.\nIn the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important.\nProf John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving \&quot;a good quality of life in later years even more important\&quot;.\n\&quot;This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,\&quot;

If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'\&quot;\nAbout half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.\nThe Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.\nHe then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.\nThe Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.\nLike many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.\n\&quot;He didn't make a lot of money,\&quot; his father said. \&quot;Most of his money went on rent and food.\n\&quot;He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.\&quot;\nHe said his son was happy in London.\nFriends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.\nGésio César D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.\n\&quot;We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,\&quot; he said.\nOn 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.\nThey believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.\nIt is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.\nUndercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.\nHe took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.\nPolice were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.\nIn the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.\nAlmost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.\nOn 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined £175,000 with £385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial.

ankle injury.\nNext weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.\nVerdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.\nForm: One defeat in past 19.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).\nLiverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.\nThe disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.\nIt is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.\nManager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.\nVerdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.\nForm: Unbeaten in past four.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).\nArsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.\nEven at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.\nAre they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\nVerdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\nForm: Unbeaten in past 12.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\nVerdict: Top four should be the target.

After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices.\n\&quot;It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament.\&quot;\nThings seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set.\nEvans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error.\nRobredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans.\nFrom standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point.\nHe closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end.\n\&quot;It's been a great experience, a great learning curve,\&quot; added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September.\n\&quot;I can definitely play with these guys so I should be confident going into the next tournaments.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A battling Dan Evans could not take his surprise US Open run into the second week as he lost to Spanish 19th seed Tommy Robredo in four sets.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;23906759&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again.\nPredictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution \&quot;as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy\&quot;.\nQasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president.\nHis appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a \&quot;rarest of the rare crime\&quot;, a condition for handing out the death penalty in India.\nBut, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime.\nTwo-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.\nIndia has shied away from executing people for many years now.\nThere have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.\nClemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.\nThen there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.\nRecently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.\n\&quot;Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,\&quot; says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.\nWhat do you think?&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Should India abolish the death penalty?&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;19410108&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday.\nBut poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements.\nHigh winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres.\nThe ship had been anchored to help control its movement.\nSalvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as \&quot;difficult\&quot;.\nThe Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.\nWater, described as being \&quot;lightly contaminated with oil\&quot; is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.\nThe film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.\nWith no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.\nDivers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.\nThe Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: \&quot;I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.\&quot;\nThe 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter \&quot;refloated\&quot; itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.\nIt was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a \&quot;small opening in the vessel\&quot; that had since been closed.\nA refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.\nSalvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.\nThe Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.\nThere were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel.\nTwo crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.\nTwo senior officers and a pilot stayed on board before being taken ashore.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;High winds are affecting the operation to salvage the cargo ship that ran aground in the Solent.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;30745137&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.\nThe diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.\nResearchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.\nThe study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.\nDiamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.\nA research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.\nThey noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.\nWhile ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \&quot;Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\&quot;\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \&quot;The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\&quot;It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\&quot;\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \&quot;It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\&quot;\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \&quot;I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\n\&quot;This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\&quot;\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \&quot;blue planet\&quot; seems even more appropriate for Earth.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Minerals preserved in diamond have revealed hints of the bright blue rocks that exist deep within the Earth.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;26553115&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:75,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Peter Whittle said he would back Paul Nuttall as \&quot;a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty\&quot; of all members.\nFormer deputy leader Mr Nuttall, former deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans and ex- soldier John Rees-Evans remain in the contest, to be decided on 28 November.\nRaheem Kassam also withdrew from the contest on Monday.\nIn a message on Facebook, Mr Whittle said Thursday's High Court ruling, which found that the government could not trigger Article 50 - the formal process of leaving the EU - without consulting Parliament, showed that \&quot;the battle to ensure that the Leave vote in the referendum is respected is far from over and UKIP is needed more than ever\&quot;.\nMr Whittle, the party's culture spokesman and a former London mayoral candidate, added that the \&quot;sheer breadth of Paul's political experience, his dedication to the values of the party and the obvious affection in which he is held by members make him the person who is best placed to take us forward\&quot;.\nNigel Farage is back as interim leader after his successor Diane James quit just 18 days into the job.\nMr Kassam, a former aide to Mr Farage, had endorsed Mr Whittle after himself pulling out of the race.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Another contender to become UKIP leader has pulled out of the contest - leaving three in the race.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;37872311&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:76,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Aberdeen-born artist has been recognised for raising awareness of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nShe has been awarded the RSGS's latest Livingstone Medal.\nThe singer said: \&quot;I'm truly honoured to receive such a significant and historical award as the Livingstone Medal.\&quot;\nIt was first awarded in 1901 to explorer Sir Harry H Johnston.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Singer Annie Lennox OBE has been honoured for her humanitarian work by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;35553131&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;document&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In the court filings, the organisations said that there was \&quot;no adequate justification\&quot; for the FBI to continue to withhold the information.\nThey added that they did not seek information that would jeopardise national security.\nThe groups sued the FBI last year.\nAssociated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today, are seeking to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the event.\nThe FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who helped unlock the phone, which was used by killer Syed Rizwan Farook.\nThe process would have involved finding a way to bypass the passcode on a locked phone. In normal circumstances, if 10 incorrect attempts at the code are made, the device will automatically erase all of its data.\n\&quot;While it is undisputed that the vendor developed the iPhone access tool, the government has identified no rational reason why knowing the vendor's identity is linked in any way to the substance of the tool, much less how such knowledge would reveal any information about the tool's application,\&quot; lawyers for the news organisations wrote in the filing to the US District Court in Washington.\n\&quot;Release of this information goes to the very heart of the Freedom of Information Act's purpose, allowing the public to assess government activity - here, the decision to pay public funds to an outside entity in possession of a tool that can compromise the digital security of millions of Americans.\&quot;\nFarook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city in December 2015.\nIn February, a court order demanded that Apple help unlock the phone, something which Apple resisted, saying it was unable to do so.\nIt added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light.\nThere was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he \&quot;will make in the remaining seven years\&quot; in his post.\nHe added that it was worth it, even though no details of what was found have been released.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Three news organisations have asked a US judge to force the government to reveal the amount it paid for technology to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman.&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;39038936&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:204045,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODY5Niwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0VkaW5idXJnaE5MUC94c3VtIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTIyMjk2LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.Xe5X6JRqXI4vamMnTCMWQXLDqTQ5gtFietmv4iFYZvESCtciJEATSMbR_RDkmQsQW_pbSOjD00pubeylnE09CQ&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;EdinburghNLP/xsum&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/5fbfd09ee366524fe8e97cd3/KBva4SboTuDXRdYqWZsCX.png&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;EdinburghNLP - Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Edinburgh&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;EdinburghNLP&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:17},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten," she said.
"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?"
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done," he said.
"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses."
He said it was important that "immediate steps" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.
One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.
The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.
Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.
Police have appealed for information about the attack.
Insp David Gibson said: "It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.
"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately."</span></div></div>

Sebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.
The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.
But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said "no clear instruction was given on where he should park".
Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.
Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer "did a good job and I didn't".
Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.
After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.
But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.
Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.
The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.
Vettel said: "Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time."
Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.
The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.
He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.
Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.
The 24-year-old said: "I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.
"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying."
Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: "Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was."
The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.
FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he "felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance", adding: "We live in a world where there is too much over reaction."
The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.
But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.
Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.
The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.
Todt said he was "optimistic" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.
"We should listen to the people watching on TV," Rosberg said. "If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it."
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.
Ricciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.
German Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.

The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.
Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies," said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: "The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage."
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.
The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.
The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.</span></div></div>

Officers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.
Earlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.
The chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been "no hostage crises", adding that the man was "alone in the room".
Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.
He said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.
"His firearm was taken away," Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.
The incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.</span></div></div>

Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.
Glasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.
Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.
Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.
It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.
Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.
But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.
The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.
It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.
Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.
The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.
However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.
Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: "We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.
"Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.
"It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference."

Ten minutes before the crash the car was in London Road, Croydon, when a Volkswagen Passat collided with a tree.
Police want to trace Nathan Davis, 27, who they say has links to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene.
Ms Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries, a post-mortem examination found.
No arrests have been made as yet, police said.
Ms Chango-Alverez was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road.
She was born in Ecuador and had lived in London for 13 years, BBC London reporter Gareth Furby said. At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel.
The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed.
Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim.
A statement from her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: "My family has had its heart torn out, at this Christmas time, we will never be the same again.
"On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas.
"I last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning, but moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street."
Describing the crash as "horrific" Det Insp Gordon Wallace, said: "The family are devastated. The memory of this senseless death will be with them each time they leave their home.
"The driver fled the scene abandoning the grey Audi, which was extensively damaged.
"We are looking to speak to Mr Nathan Davis in relation to this collision."
The 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in a critical condition in hospital while the condition of the 29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen is now stable.</span></div></div>

The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France.
"The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders," Team Sky's Rowe said.
"That is the fundamental issue we're looking into.
"There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes.
"In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race.
"We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us.
"Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that."
Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later.
The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident.
The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety.
Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium.
"As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races."
In a separate incident, another Belgian cyclist, Daan Myngheer, 22, died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.</span></div></div>

The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap.
He said: "It is heavy mentally to accept that."
Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in "weeks" rather than months.
He told BBC Sport: "It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.
"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six."
Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.
He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.
Gundogan said: "Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.
"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start."
City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.
Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.
And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.
He said: "Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.
"They are really uncomfortable to play against.
"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title."</span></div></div>

Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.
Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.
The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a "dongle" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.
"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer," Mr Newlin said.
By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.
The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).
The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).
Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.
The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.
Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.
Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.
Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,
But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.</span></div></div>

The EC said that its "preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid."
However, Amazon said it "has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg".
"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg]," it said.
The Luxembourg finance ministry said: "Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted," it said.
The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.
The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.
The Commission said it had "no indication" that the tax arrangement was "compatible with the internal market".
The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck.
Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg.
Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's "transfer pricing" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.
Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.
The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether "Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.
"If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation," the EC said.
It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.
Luxembourg's finance ministry said it "has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation."
"Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed," it added.
Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected "sweetheart" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.
In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.</span></div></div>

The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years.
Last year, it attracted more than 90,000 visitors to its recently-adopted home outside Lisburn in County Antrim.
It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013.
The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year.
The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions.
One of this year's highlights is an "edible garden", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates.
The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home.
The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show.
Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers.
For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead.
BBC News NI are covering the event live on social media on Wednesday on Twitter at @BBCNewsNI, on Snapchat at bbcnewsni, and on BBC Newsline's Facebook page.</span></div></div>

He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information.
Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a "reasonable expectation of privacy".
Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy.
Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine "sting" operation.
Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.
In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.
Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private.
On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: "Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts."
Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines.
In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was "not burdensome" to do so.
However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.
On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded.
The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.</span></div></div>

His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote.
The State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, "further degraded the legitimacy of the election".
"We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua," he added.
Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger.
A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors.
Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory.
But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a "farce".
The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting.
They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%.
Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president.
Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out.
Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment.
A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built.
The country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.</span></div></div>

The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza.
Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder.
"To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender," police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death.
She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend.
Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships.
They say "corrective rape" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or "correct" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common.
Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement.
She said it was important to get "corrective rape" classified as a hate crime.
"The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection," she told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action.
"In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously," Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying.
Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community.
"The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters," he said.
In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg.
Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.</span></div></div>

The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.
This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.
This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.
Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.
"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees," said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.
They then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.
"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus," Mr Hsiung explained.
Given that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated "the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this".
The answer? "Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times."
What is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.
The team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.
They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a "structural colour" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.
The results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.
"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split," Mr Hsiung said.
"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place."
So why did all these different species acquire the same colour?
Given their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.
That is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.
"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour," Mr Hsiung said. "That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.
"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there."
It may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.
"We don't know yet," Mr Hsiung said.

Meanwhile, the second "black box" flight recorder from the plane has been recovered.
There were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March.
The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included "ways to commit suicide" and "cockpit doors and their security provisions".
Spokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: "He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide.
"In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.''
Prosecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March.
Lubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.
The first "black box", the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site.
Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit.
The second "black box" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.
At a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was "reasonable hope" the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information.
The "completely blackened" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said.
He said: "The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight."
He told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.
As each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said,
He added 40 mobile phones had been recovered. He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were "heavily damaged".
Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.
Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of "severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.
``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.
She could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.
The final minutes
Lubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.
Little more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.

He said there was often "horseplay" with colleagues, involving "piggybacks, tickling and squeezing".
But he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.
Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.
He joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.
Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with "hundreds" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.
Under questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.
"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that."
He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a "full performance" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.
Mr Caplan asked: "Could those comments become edgy or sexual?"
Mr Fox replied: "Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top."
Referring to the "horseplay" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, "otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio".
Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: "I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?
"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed."
He added: "But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then."
One former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: "That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do."
The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.
Addressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a "play-acting high jinks thing", he said.
Mr Fox told the court he had seen it "many times", but agreed that out of context, the "Benny Hill-style" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.
Prosecutor John Price QC said: "She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?"
Mr Fox replied: "I can't get in (her) head."
Mr Price continued: "Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?" to which the defendant replied: "No."
Mr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.
"It never happened," he said, although he did acknowledge he "could have easily taken her for a tour".
Mr Fox agreed it would be "quite wrong" for an adult man to "stick his tongue" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.
If a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with "a social kiss" on the cheek, he said.
The girl in question had, he added, "become a little bit obsessed with me".
Asked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: "I don't have an explanation at all."
Mr Price said: "Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?"
The DJ replied: "I can't explain those coincidences."
The trial continues.</span></div></div>

Now in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.
Sewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.
Christian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.
But what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.
Because of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.
However, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.
When she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.
Later, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.
Afterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.
This bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a "judicial committee" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.
Karen, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.
The elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.
Despite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.
He is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.
His punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.
Even when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.
Karen's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.
In a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.
Confidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.
Nowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.
The Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.
In a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.
Their statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.
Karen Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.
For both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.
The organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves "disfellowshipped" or shunned.
Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.
For many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.
Other churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.
That inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.
However, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.
Only this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.
Todros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.
The case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.
The court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been "ostracised" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.
For young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.
Sexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.
Many religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.
The survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.
The Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:
Local authorities
The police
The Crown Prosecution Service
The Immigration Service
The BBC
The armed forces
Schools
Hospitals
Children's homes
Churches, mosques and other religious organisations
Charities and voluntary organisations
Full details of the inquiry
Caroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.</span></div></div>

The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.
The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures.
In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: "This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation."
Asked how long that would take, he replied: "It has failed already."
Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently.
He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign.
"We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy."
Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week.
But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements.
As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme.
Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout.
Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks.
But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks.
On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures.
But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420.
Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states.
It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.</span></div></div>

A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban.
"I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward," said Craven.
On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part.
But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit.
"I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view," he added.
"We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale.
"We believe the Russian NPC is either unwilling or unable to uphold the IPC anti-doping code, which is in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, so that is what they have to respond to."
Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, published last week, claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015.
The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 "disappearing positive samples" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report.
Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis.
Russia will have up to 21 days to appeal against any IPC decision, with the Rio Paralympics due to begin on 7 September.</span></div></div>

Former Sainsbury's boss Justin King has joined as interim chairman.
He said he was confident that Manor had "the right people, the right values and sheer hard work" and would be "competitive at the highest level".
King is not financially involved in the team but will take a leading role on the business side of the operation.
Fitzpatrick's investment is a personal one and the money he has put into the team does not come from Ovo.
He said: "I have a lifelong passion for F1 and can't wait for the season ahead."
Manor Marussia have announced Englishman Will Stevens will be one of their drivers and said a deal to sign the second would be completed soon.
The team's new car, a modified version of the 2014 model, must pass F1's mandatory crash tests before they can race at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from 13-15 March.
Those tests are scheduled to take place this week.
Graeme Lowdon, who has been with the team through its various guises as Manor, Virgin and Marussia, remains as president and sporting director.
He said: "It has been a challenging period for all of us but we've come through it and now we just want to go racing again.
"With formidable new business leadership in Stephen Fitzpatrick and the board presence of Justin King, we are now in a great place ahead of the new season. This is a fantastic and very rewarding moment for all those involved with the team."</span></div></div>

Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help "generate immediate benefits" for the economy.
But Plaid Cymru said it was "completely inadequate" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers.
Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties.
With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans.
The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions.
The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England.
A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships.
Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes.
The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales.
Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation.
Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth.
She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government.
She said: "This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims."
Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to "top up" existing policies.
He said: "There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves."
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.
"The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales," she said.
Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Alun Ffred Jones said: "For over six months, Labour has sat back and done nothing - exposing Wales to the full force of this economic crisis.
"Now, they're trying desperately to create the impression that this small sum of money will do what's needed. Quite simply, it will not."</span></div></div>

And he said the costs of leaving would be "substantial" and "unpalatable".
Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of the UK's departure from the EU.
Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was a "peculiar speech in the sense that it looked backwards the whole time".
He told BBC Newsnight: "It was almost like a re-fight of the referendum... strangely bitter really, and almost really the speech of someone who simply refuses to accept that the British people should have made a decision such as they did."
Prime Minister Theresa May plans to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins two years of formal negotiations, by the end of March.
She has already confirmed the UK will not remain a member of the EU single market but will instead seek a new free trade deal with the remaining members.
In a speech in London, Sir John, who campaigned for a Remain vote in June's referendum, claimed there was "little chance" the advantages of being part of the EU single market could be replicated once the UK leaves.
"I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic," he said.
"Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery."
For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.
In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not.
First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a "historic mistake".
It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally, the US, as a consequence.
Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe.
What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concern about how the public is being treated in the months after the referendum decision.

Sir John said Brexit talks require "statesmanship of a high order" and warned of a "real risk" of the exit deal falling "well below the hopes and expectations" that have been raised, saying he doubted the "rosy confidence being offered to the British people".
"In my own experience, the most successful results are obtained when talks are conducted with goodwill: it is much easier to reach agreement with a friend than a quarrelsome neighbour.
"Behind the diplomatic civilities, the atmosphere is already sour. A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests."
He also said the "cheerleaders" for Brexit had shown a "disregard that amounts to contempt" towards those that backed the losing side.
And he said the UK would become "far more dependent" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as "less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors".
Sir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that "uncertainties over border restrictions" after Brexit were "a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South".
The ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to "face down" people calling for "total disengagement" from Europe.
But the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous "don't bind my hands" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now "seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU".
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: "It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May."</span></div></div>

But Labour argued the cap would be a "hit and run" on working families.
Benefits have historically risen in line with the rate of inflation. The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT.
The House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April.
The coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation.
But Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people.
Some Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain.
Mr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it "objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families".
Despite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote.
Legislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit.
The cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit.
These benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as "uprating".
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
Glance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent.
Figures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save £2.8bn in 2015/16, compared with the government's previous plans.
The overall welfare budget in 2011/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is £201bn.
The political debate will centre on who should feel the pain.
Jobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.
Those for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.
The estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is £3.2 billion.
They increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.
During lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: "The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War."
He added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had "grown" in the last few years.
"These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about," Mr Duncan Smith said.
For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.
But Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.
Mr Byrne said the government was showing "contempt" by trying to "ram this bill through the House in just one day".
He added: "It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it."
Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: "Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?"
Sarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill "with a heavy heart" because it was "disingenuous" to try to "find someone to blame for our own woes".
"A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor," she told MPs. "Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.
"It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate."
However, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: "It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work."
David Cameron's official spokesman said: "The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end."
The BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an "impact assessment" published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing £5 a week or about £250 over the three year period.
The majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of £3 a week worse off.</span></div></div>

The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected.
Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed.
It said the repair work was "extremely complex" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it.
Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday.
Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted.
London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate.
Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: "Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job.
"While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed.
"This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground."
Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working "as hard as possible" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour.
Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole "couldn't be in a worse place".
"This is a massive piece of railway," he told BBC Radio London. "It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge."
Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far.
Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling.
Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption.
And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area.
It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute.
New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

The introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo.
It was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season

James Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City.
And it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium.

Everton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break.
But David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance.
Moyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in.
Mancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.
Everton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.
Moyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.
Sergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.
It was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.
Balotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.

The visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.
Balotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.
Silva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.
Everton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.

But Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.
Ms Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.
Delayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.
Ms Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.
She said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.
Ms Dugdale added: "That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.
"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there."
She also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to "completely eradicate" the problem.
The substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: "Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target."
A delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.
Dr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.
According to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed "zero delays over six weeks" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.
The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.
Dr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.

Ms Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said "real progress" was being made.
She later added: "Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.
"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours."
That comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.
Dr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.
He also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.
Dr Simpson added: "We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.
"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.
"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand."
But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: "The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.
"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.
"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours."</span></div></div>

But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area.
The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements.
Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar.
The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date.
The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system.
Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea.
At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws.
It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter.
2,200
hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales
20,000 waterfowl are supported
13,590  oystercatchers
35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck
The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges.
It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills.
RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water.
The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020.
However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted "too late" and was failing in its obligations.
Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020."
Welsh Water added: "We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away."
The UK Government said all sites in England included in the judgement "now comply with the directive and plans are in place elsewhere across the UK to deliver compliance by 2020 at the latest".</span></div></div>

The Pope was greeted by President Raul Castro after landing in the capital, Havana.
The Pope is due to celebrate Mass on Sunday in Havana's iconic Revolution Square.
He will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the US.
Following his arrival on Cuba on Saturday, thousands lined the route of the Pope's motorcade to the home of the Vatican's ambassador to Cuba.
Pope Francis - the first pontiff to hail from Latin America  - is credited with helping the recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US.
Mr Castro has thanked the Pope for his contribution.
Speaking at the airport alongside President Castro, Pope Francis urged further support for Cuba's Catholics "so that the Church can continue to support and encourage the Cuban people in its hopes and concerns, with the freedom, the means and the space needed to bring the proclamation of the kingdom to the existential peripheries of society".
He also called on Cuba and the US to "persevere on the path" of detente.
On Thursday the Vatican said it hoped the Pope's visit would help bring an end to the 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the island.
Pensioner Diego Carrera told AP the visit was "like a breath of hope blowing over Cuba" because of the role that the Pope played in the reestablishment of relations with the US.
On Friday the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Communist Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations.
At the scene: Will Grant, BBC News, Havana
Disembarking to chants of "Christ lives" and other religious slogans, the Pope was welcomed off the plane by Raul Castro. He was quick to praise the pontiff for his leadership on issues of climate change and poverty and thanked him for his role in brokering talks with Washington.
The Pope said he was in Cuba to "support and encourage the Cuban people in their hopes and concerns". While he didn't shy away from using the word "freedom" in his initial address, he is still unlikely to publically berate the Cuban government over its human rights record - choosing instead a more pragmatic approach.
As the first Latin American pope, he's likely to receive a unique welcome from the Cuban people - many of whom remember when a commitment to atheism was a key part of the constitution.
Cuba all set for Pope Francis
Cristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square.
Workers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir on the square.
Streets have been newly paved in Havana, and the cathedral has been renovated.
In the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.
Nearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists were expected to cover the visit.
In 1998 Pope John Paul II became the first Pope to visit the island, saying: "May Cuba... open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba."
His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba in 2012.
Francis's trip will later take him to the US, which he will also be visiting for the first time since his election to the papacy.</span></div></div>

Cricket Scotland chairman Keith Oliver said: "There is no doubt that the governing body of cricket in Scotland is unrecognisable from where we were in 2004.
"And the credit for this must go to Roddy and his staff."
During Smith's time as chief executive, his management team have increased from eight to 25 and turnover has quadrupled.
I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels
Cricket Scotland reported a rise in participation figures for players, coaches and umpires during those 10 years.
And the national side have secured a place at next year's World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand by beating Kenya in a qualifying event.
Oliver, who has worked with Smith during that whole period, said: "Back then, we could not have imagined we would have won global qualifying events, played in world cups at youth and senior level, played One Day International games in front of thousands, run a fully professional national team as well as winning numerous development awards at a European and Global level.
"I and all at Cricket Scotland wish Roddy every success in his next role."
Cricket Scotland will start the recruitment process to find Smith's successor with the aim of having a replacement in place early in the new year.
Smith said: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Cricket Scotland and it's hard to believe it has been nearly a decade.
"I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels.
"Ten years is a long time for a chief executive of a national governing body and now feels exactly the right time to move on to my next challenge.
"With a Cricket World Cup to look forward to early next year and a number of newly-appointed quality staff to work with, I am looking forward to handing over to my successor an organisation that is very well placed to succeed in the future."

Sunderland claim speculation about Allardyce has been "extremely damaging" and have urged the FA to "bring about a swift resolution to the matter".
England are searching for a new boss after Roy Hodgson quit on 28 June.
He resigned after the national team were knocked out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage by Iceland.
Photographs that appeared to show Allardyce, 61, at the home of FA vice-chairman David Gill were published in the media in the past 24 hours.
Allardyce had been on tour with Sunderland in Austria until he returned home at the start of the week, reportedly on transfer business.
Sunderland said they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA as a "potential candidate" after he requested permission, but are upset discussions did not remain confidential.
"After what was an extremely challenging season, we are keen to see a period of stability, both on and off the field, and we want him to remain as manager of our football club," read a club statement issued on Wednesday.
Kevin Davies, who played under Allardyce at Bolton, thinks his former boss would be a good choice for England.
"Where we are now as a nation, I think he is probably the right man," said Davies, who earned one England cap during his career.
"Motivation-wise, he is fantastic, the best I have ever worked with. He knows how to get the best out of a player.
"He has a lot of other strengths, too. He surrounds himself with the best people in the best roles, which allows him to plan and get the best out of his squad."
Davies also thinks Allardyce will improve morale in the dressing room.
"The atmosphere he will create will be similar to Wales or Iceland... that spirit, that togetherness, along with the ability that we have a lacked," said Davies.
"I think he has always thrived on being the underdog and I think England are going to go into a lot of games as underdogs in the future, so it probably will suit the way England are at the moment. "
Allardyce is not the only Premier League manager linked with the England job.
Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and Hull City's Steve Bruce have all been touted as possible candidates.
United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann and former England manager Glenn Hoddle have also been linked with the job, but Allardyce is the frontrunner.
The former West Ham, Newcastle, Bolton and Blackburn boss, who has one year left on his Sunderland contract, won a lot of plaudits for keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League last season.
England begin their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign on 4 September, when they face Slovakia in Trnava.
The two sides met at Euro 2016, battling out a goalless draw in Group B.

The England manager will be chosen by a three-man panel - Gill, FA technical director Dan Ashworth and chief executive Martin Glenn.
They want the next boss to be a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who will build a clear team identity and help shape the team into a cohesive unit.
Allardyce was previously interviewed for the role in 2006 after Sven-Goran Eriksson left following that year's World Cup.
Eriksson's assistant Steve McClaren got the job instead but he failed to guide England to qualification for the 2008 European Championship.
Here's what Allardyce has since said about the England job:
2009
After missing out to McClaren:
"I should have got it and I really don't know why I didn't. It had to be political for me, rather than my credentials.
"Maybe my external look isn't to everybody's liking. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view.
"It seems foreign coaches are still all the craze for the top jobs and that is a great shame. I also think that Steve not being successful was a massive blow for British or English managers, because it has put us down a peg or two."
2015
From his autobiography:
"I wanted to do a real knock-your-socks-off interview for the FA, so I put together a PowerPoint which looked at every single detail.
"Nobody but nobody was going to beat it. But then Brian Barwick, the chief executive, told me there were no PowerPoint facilities at the interview venue, so I had to print off hard copies for the panel. So much for the progressive FA.
"I should have got it and, as I'm a better manager now than I was then, I believe I should be in the running whenever it comes round again. That's not vanity or being full of my own importance. My track record entitles me to be considered."
May 2016
Prior to Euro 2016:
"That's gone. For me to be interested in the England job, Roy would probably have to leave at the end of the Euros.
"And would England be interested in me? They say they are looking for an English manager, but will they do it? You've got this, 'what's sexier?' element now, rather than how good you are at doing the job."</span></div></div>

All the tries came in the second half with Liam Williams and Gareth Davies crossing as Wales twice opened an eight-point lead.
But Juan Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo both scored as the Pumas refused to lie down.
Full-back Leigh Halfpenny's 78th-minute penalty edged Wales four points clear to settle the encounter.
The Toulon full-back scored 14 points with the boot, which ultimately proved the difference between the sides in a match which did not quite live up to expectations.
Read: Wales restored pride, says Howley
Howley praises 'world class' lock Jones
Following their 32-8 defeat by Australia the previous week, Wales were relieved to hang on against a Pumas side that refused to buckle in the face of extreme pressure.
After coach Rob Howley had asked for a response from his team, man of the match Alun Wyn Jones and wing Williams - who both missed the Wallabies defeat - made a huge impact on their returns.
Williams' determination for his try typified a full-blooded display by the Scarlets back.
Argentina failed to rediscover the exciting running which saw them beat Ireland at the same stadium in the 2015 World Cup.
And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern.
Wales controlled the opening period but, apart from two penalties by Halfpenny, had little to show for their dominance at the break as Argentina repeatedly infringed in their own 22.
When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play.

After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez.
When Davies dummied over for his eighth international try and Halfpenny converted, it looked as though Wales would pull clear.
But the Pumas, with Sanchez a probing threat at fly-half, hit back again when Landajo was given the benefit of the doubt by television official Sean Davey.
An exchange of penalties meant Wales led by a point before Halfpenny eased the nerves with his fifth successful kick of the game.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England.
Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium.
Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection.
The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles.
The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated.
It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion.
Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: "These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future.
"The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front.
"The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory.
"Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation.
"One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour."
Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: "It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand.
"The special connections that were forged 100 years ago, with communities in the UK where New Zealanders trained, are still strong today and it's moving to see these sites protected for generations to come."</span></div></div>

I cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.
Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.
When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.
Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.
At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.
We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.
They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.
For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.
He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.
He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.
So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.
At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.
These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.
Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.
Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.
But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.
You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.
Villa's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.
They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.
I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.
You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.
I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.
Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.
The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.
Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.
In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.
But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.
Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.
Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.
Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.
Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.
However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.
When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.
You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.
That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.
After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.
A settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.

But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health.
And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions.
Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013.
Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages.
This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012.
The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013.
Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease.
In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important.
Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving "a good quality of life in later years even more important".
"This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health," he said.
"Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years."
He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas.
Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years.
"Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country," he said.
In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics.
But there are also wide variations across the country.</span></div></div>

He had joined an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Brazilians - including some relatives - in London and quickly learnt to speak English.
The son of bricklayer Matosinhos Otoni da Silva, Mr Menezes was born in the town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas Gerais - a source of many migrants to Europe and the US.
He spent his childhood living in an adobe hut in the town.
Mr Silva told BBC News his son had always wanted to be an electrician - as a child, he would make electrical toys with batteries, copper and matchboxes.
Mr Menezes moved to Sao Paulo to live with his uncle at the age of 14, attended high school and became a qualified electrician.
His father said Mr Menezes had always had a desire to move abroad to earn money.
"When he was a child he said: 'Father, I heard on the radio people make good money in England, the United States, France. If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'"
About half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.
The Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.
He then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.
The Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.
Like many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.
"He didn't make a lot of money," his father said. "Most of his money went on rent and food.
"He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch."
He said his son was happy in London.
Friends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.
Gésio César D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.
"We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube," he said.
On 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.
They believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.
It is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.
Undercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.
He took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.
Police were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.
In the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.
Almost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.
On 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined £175,000 with £385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times
An inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.
The Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.
In January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial. A colourful mosaic framing a photograph of Mr Menezes was created by local artist Mary Edwards.</span></div></div>

Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.
Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase.
Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later.
Mr McAveety said: "Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city.
"One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city."
The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure.
But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in.
Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections.
BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: "Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase.
"Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place.
"They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'.
"However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts."
Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely.
There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire.
The Scottish government has said more money would be available in the coming financial year for local services across Scotland.
For example, there will be new money through the council tax changes and cash which will be given to headteachers to spend on schemes to raise attainment.
A final decision on the council tax in Glasgow is likely to be made in February.</span></div></div>

He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result.
"We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason," said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.
Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.
It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda.
Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation.
In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.
Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission "lacked independence and transparency", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that "those Europeans are not serious".
"Transparency is what we've been voting for," he added.
Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.
However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.
On Friday, the US said Mr Museveni should "rein in" his security forces after they briefly arrested Mr Besigye, and fired tear gas to disperse his supporters in Kampala.</span></div></div>

Australia would have won had replacement Kurtley Beale not failed with two late penalties.
"It was a remarkable win and a remarkable result," North said.
"It was an unbelievable feeling. We won and I got my first [Lions] Test try. It doesn't get much better than that.
"My heart was in my mouth at the end. I think everyone was feeling the same.
"It's always good to get a win, and while it was tough towards the end we are delighted to have got that first win in the series.
"We've spoken a lot about momentum these past few weeks, and that could be huge for us now heading into the second Test next week."
The Wallabies were leading 7-3 through Israel Folau's converted before the Lions hit back with a fine individual try from North.
The 21-year-old, making his Lions Test debut, effortlessly beat three players during a 60-metre run before crossing for his third try of the tour.
"When the ball dropped out of the sky, my first thought was just to run," said North.
"Luckily, I saw a gap and I just went for it. It opened up for me, and I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line."
North, who has joined Northampton Saints from Scarlets ahead of the 2013-14 season, thought he had struck again just five minutes later when he squeezed over in the corner.
But the television match official ruled a combination of opposite number Israel Folau getting a hand underneath the ball and the Lions wing's free arm hitting the touchline meant no try.
"I felt it was a try. At the end of the day, the TMO makes his call and you have to live with it. But I certainly felt that I had got there," North added.
"Perhaps one or two things didn't quite go for us in that regard today, so it makes the win even better."
The Lions face Melbourne Rebels, led by former Wales number eight Gareth Delve, on Tuesday before next Saturday's second Test against the Wallabies in the same city.
Victory at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium would secure a first Lions Test series win since 1997 but North believes there is room for improvement.
"I definitely think we can play a lot better than we did," North added.
"We need to be more clinical, and we need to get a bit more accuracy in our game.
"It's a funny one, really. We know we can play better than that, but we are obviously still delighted to get the win.
"That wasn't our best performance, and we need to keep pushing for next week."
North's Wales team-mate Cuthbert, who scored the Lions' second try, expects an Australian backlash in the second Test.
"Australia are not going to lie down and let us win this," Cuthbert said.
"They're going to put in one hell of an effort and I think they thought they probably could have won that game so they're going to be straight at us again next week. We've got a lot to work on."</span></div></div>

Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness.
Both men deny any wrongdoing.
Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down.
Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: "Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully."
But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: "We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person."
Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation.
The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier.
It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it.
Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its "financial situation".
But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser.
Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body.
Mr Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract that was "unfavourable to Fifa". He is due to stand down next year, but says he will carry on in the role despite the criminal proceedings.</span></div></div>

The world number six will now face the winner of Stephen Maguire's match against Barry Hawkins for a place in Sunday's final.
"I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have," Higgins said.
"I was close last year, Alan [McManus] pipped me [in the quarter-final]," he added.
"A couple of years after 2011, I'd been losing, my form wasn't great and you don't think you're going to get back to that one-table set up.
"It's the best place in the world to get out and play and I can't wait to get into the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. I'm buzzing."
Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament.
The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final.
"The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year," he said.

"I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren.
"To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing.
"There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches."
Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments.
Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final.
"Everybody's got their own choices in life and us Scots, we maybe like a drink and there's nothing wrong with that," Higgins said. "Life's too short.
"Stephen is a great player and I hope [he] comes through. If he was to beat me, I would be the first one to cheer him to win his first world title.
"But I get on well with Barry as well and I know how difficult he is to beat. In the last few years he's grown into a great champion, because he always had the game and he's got the belief now."</span></div></div>

The inquest in Woking was told Pte Wilkinson and Pte James had been caught in bed by her boyfriend Sapper Simeon Carr-Minns, known then as Jim.
Pte James was found dead with a bullet wound to the head in November 1995.
The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was one of four recruits to die at the base in seven years.
Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died.
He said: "I just remember saying 'pick one of us, if you want to be friends that would be fine if you want to stay with him'. She said that she did not."
Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty.
He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard.
He said the officer "pretty much escorted me back to the barracks".
The major has previously told the inquest that he did not march Mr Wilkinson off.
The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James.
He also told the hearing about his anger and upset after Mr Carr-Minns caught him in bed with Pte James, days before she died.
He said Pte James told him then she was splitting up with Mr Carr-Minns.
Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, suggested to Mr Wilkinson he was "not just angry" but "humiliated" when Mr Carr-Minns turned up because other people who were also in the room began to tease and laugh at him.
Mr Wilkinson said being caught in bed by her boyfriend "is not what you want".
Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: "Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?"
Mr Wilkinson said he had always given the same account but the other officer remembered it differently.
Ms Foster then recalled a statement from December 2002 in which Mr Wilkinson commented that if he had not been forced off the grounds he could have been facing a murder charge and been in prison.
But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge.
Ms Foster took Mr Wilkinson through differences in statements he has made and said: "Your story gets more and more elaborate as time goes by.
"Your upset and humiliation gave you a motive to be seriously angry with Cheryl.
"Is it the case you have been less than truthful for your reason for going to see her on Monday morning?"
But Mr Wilkinson replied: "No that is not true. I have said all that I remembered."
Mr Wilkinson was asked if he saw Pte James sitting by a tree, if either of them had messed with her rifle, if he saw an accident happen to her, if he was present when the trigger was pulled, and if he heard the shot - he replied "no" to each question.
He had earlier denied he got violent when angry but Ms Foster pointed out he put someone's head through an arcade machine when he thought they were laughing about Pte James's death.
Mr Wilkinson said he had been pushed to breaking point and added: "I think any other person would have done the same thing."
A first inquest into Pte James's death in December 1995 recorded an open verdict. This second inquest was ordered after High Court judges quashed the original findings.
The hearing continues.</span></div></div>

The jury was told he took them to a Bishopsgate flat, where he spanked the younger girl and had sex with her.
He denies sexual activity with a minor and paying a child for sex.
Mr Richard, a US citizen who lives in Islington, north London, says the sex was consensual and that he "reasonably believed" the girl was over 16.
He gave a total of Â£480 to the teenager and her friend, which he says was for "travel expenses".
Prosecutor Gino Connor told the jury how Mr Richard met the girl through a US website where he listed his profile as a "sugar daddy", while 13-year-old called herself a "sugar baby".
During an iChat exchange retrieved from his laptop, the defendant asked her for a "revealing" photograph on her hands and knees.
"You are my new daddy I will do anything to keep you happy," the girl replied.
They arranged to meet and Mr Richard made a payment of Â£120 through PayPal, the court heard.
The girls travelled to Liverpool Street station on the morning of 2 January, where they met Mr Richard in a nearby cafe.
He asked their ages and they told him they were 16 and 17, the court heard.
Police were alerted after the mother of the older girl noticed a PayPal deposit in her bank account.
An examination of the 13-year-old on 4 January indicted she had suffered an injury that could have been caused by sex.
Mr Richard was arrested the following day at the Lord Milner Hotel in Belgravia.
The court heard he reacted by saying: "As you can see I am in a lot of trouble."

"Caster Semenya is one of the contenders," Mutola, who won the 800m Olympic title at the 2000 Olympics, told BBC Africa.
"Pamela Jelimo from Kenya and the Russians are also very, very capable. I'm looking forward to a good final."
Mutola, 39, set the benchmark for women's 800m running until her retirement in 2008, winning three world titles and the Olympic title in Sydney.
Semenya, who won the 800m title at the 2009 World Championships, asked her "idol" Mutola to be her coach at the end of last year with the sole purpose of helping her win Olympic gold.
The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals.
"In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race," explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations.
"You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes.
"Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time."
Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title.
Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times.
Semenya was suspended for 11 months by the IAAF but was cleared to return to the track in July 2010.
She won silver at last year's World Championships in Daegu despite a back problem.</span></div></div>

Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival.
The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people.
Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike.
His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin.
"A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger," the lawsuit says.
Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: "What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life.
"Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives.
"We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes."
Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car.
According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08.
In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a "critical point where public safety could be compromised" if changes are not made.
Organisers called the report incomplete and said it failed to address root issues.
SXSW is known as one of the world's best platforms for rising music talent.

It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday.
Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident.
An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees.
Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver.
He said in response to the video: "I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up."
Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a "scrappy entrepreneur" to be more like a "leader of a major global company".
One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an "opportunity to reboot".
Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: "This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change."
Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying.
As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director.
She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week.
Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn. Although revenues hit $6.5bn last year, it is yet to make a profit.</span></div></div>

Chelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.
So, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?
Form: Won 14 out of past 15.
Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home).
Conte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.
The wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.
In the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.
In the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.
If that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.
Verdict: Back on track and clear title favourites.
Form: Won past six.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home).
Mauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.
It was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.
Harry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.
They ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.
The Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a "bad" ankle injury.
Next weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.
Verdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.
Form: One defeat in past 19.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).
Liverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.
The disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.
It is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.
Manager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.
Verdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.
Form: Unbeaten in past four.
Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).
Arsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.
Even at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.
Are they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.
Verdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?
Form: Two defeats in past three.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).
Manager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.
City now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.
And this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.
Only five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.
The problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.
City have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.
Verdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.
Form: Unbeaten in past 12.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).
Manchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.
They could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.
United have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.
Mourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.
Verdict: Top four should be the target. The title is now out of reach.</span></div></div>

Robredo, who struggled with a leg injury in the closing stages, fought back superbly from 5-3 down in the fourth set to claim victory.
Evans, ranked 179th, earned £60,000 in prize money for his efforts and enough points to get close to the world's top 150, but missed out on a possible dream fourth-round match against Roger Federer.
"It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points," Evans told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I felt in pretty much total control of the match. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth.
"I just played two really loose points - that's all it was. They came at the wrong time. I just have to learn on that for next time."
It was the British number three's sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows after coming through three rounds of qualifying, then beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic.
He had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament before New York, and playing under lights on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a sparse crowd, was a far cry from the Challenger events he is more used to.
Evans impressed in the opening set but 31-year-old Robredo's experience told as he edged it in the tie-break, then raced through the second in just 28 minutes.
Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace.
"I was sure the match was heading to a fifth set but Dan Evans just tightened up. After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices.
"It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament."
Things seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set.
Evans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error.
Robredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans.
From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point.
He closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end.
"It's been a great experience, a great learning curve," added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September.
"I can definitely play with these guys so I should be confident going into the next tournaments."</span></div></div>

Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution "as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy".
Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president.
His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a "rarest of the rare crime", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India.
But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime.
Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.
India has shied away from executing people for many years now.
There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.
Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.
Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.
Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.
"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty," says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements.
High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres.
The ship had been anchored to help control its movement.
Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as "difficult".
The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.
Water, described as being "lightly contaminated with oil" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.
The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.
With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.
Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.
The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: "I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel."
The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter "refloated" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.
It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a "small opening in the vessel" that had since been closed.
A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.
Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.
The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.
There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel.
Two crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.
Two senior officers and a pilot stayed on board before being taken ashore.</span></div></div>

The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.
Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.
The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.
Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.
A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.
They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.
While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.
While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.
Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: "Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface."
The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.
Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: "The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.
"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres."
Describing his diamond sample, he said: "It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has."
Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.
He said: "I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.
"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy."
A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.
Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.
Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.
Given the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term "blue planet" seems even more appropriate for Earth.</span></div></div>

They added that they did not seek information that would jeopardise national security.
The groups sued the FBI last year.
Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today, are seeking to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the event.
The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who helped unlock the phone, which was used by killer Syed Rizwan Farook.
The process would have involved finding a way to bypass the passcode on a locked phone. In normal circumstances, if 10 incorrect attempts at the code are made, the device will automatically erase all of its data.
"While it is undisputed that the vendor developed the iPhone access tool, the government has identified no rational reason why knowing the vendor's identity is linked in any way to the substance of the tool, much less how such knowledge would reveal any information about the tool's application," lawyers for the news organisations wrote in the filing to the US District Court in Washington.
"Release of this information goes to the very heart of the Freedom of Information Act's purpose, allowing the public to assess government activity - here, the decision to pay public funds to an outside entity in possession of a tool that can compromise the digital security of millions of Americans."
Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city in December 2015.
In February, a court order demanded that Apple help unlock the phone, something which Apple resisted, saying it was unable to do so.
It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light.
There was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he "will make in the remaining seven years" in his post.
He added that it was worth it, even though no details of what was found have been released.</span></div></div>
