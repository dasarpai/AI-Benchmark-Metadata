He was born in London, the son of a barrister, and was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1845, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1859. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1867, and was knighted in 1871.\n\nReynolds was a prolific author, writing on a wide range of topics. He wrote several books on legal topics, including The Law of Libel and Slander (1863), The Law of Copyright (1865), and The Law of Patents for Inventions (1868). He also wrote on a variety of other topics, including history, biography, and literature. He was a frequent contributor to the Saturday Review, and wrote several books on Shakespeare, including The Mystery of William Shakespeare (1848) and The Authorship of Shakespeare (1875). He also wrote a biography of the poet John Keats (1848).&quot;},&quot;wiki_bio_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \&quot;Reynolds Baronetcy\&quot;, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \&quot;Essay on Vertigo\&quot;; in 1855 \&quot;Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\&quot;, as well as \&quot;Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\&quot;; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \&quot;Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\&quot;; in 1872 \&quot;The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\&quot;; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \&quot;System of Medicine\&quot;, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \&quot;Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\&quot;. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.&quot;},&quot;gpt3_sentences&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;John Russell Reynolds (1820–1876) was an English lawyer, judge, and author.&quot;,&quot;He was born in London, the son of a barrister, and was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.&quot;,&quot;He was called to the bar in 1845, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1859.&quot;,&quot;He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1867, and was knighted in 1871.&quot;,&quot;Reynolds was a prolific author, writing on a wide range of topics.&quot;,&quot;He wrote several books on legal topics, including The Law of Libel and Slander (1863), The Law of Copyright (1865), and The Law of Patents for Inventions (1868).&quot;,&quot;He also wrote on a variety of other topics, including history, biography, and literature.&quot;,&quot;He was a frequent contributor to the Saturday Review, and wrote several books on Shakespeare, including The Mystery of William Shakespeare (1848) and The Authorship of Shakespeare (1875).&quot;,&quot;He also wrote a biography of the poet John Keats (1848).&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;John Russell Reynolds (1820–1876) was an English lawyer, judge, and author.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He was born in London, the son of a barrister, and was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He was called to the bar in 1845, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1859.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1867, and was knighted in 1871.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Reynolds was a prolific author, writing on a wide range of topics.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He wrote several books on legal topics, including The Law of Libel and Slander (1863), The Law of Copyright (1865), and The Law of Patents for Inventions (1868).\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He also wrote on a variety of other topics, including history, biography, and literature.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He was a frequent contributor to the Saturday Review, and wrote several books on Shakespeare, including The Mystery of William Shakespeare (1848) and The Authorship of Shakespeare (1875).\&quot;,\n  \&quot;He also wrote a biography of the poet John Keats (1848).\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;annotation&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;,&quot;major_inaccurate&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;,\n  \&quot;major_inaccurate\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;wiki_bio_test_idx&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:62464,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;62,464&quot;},&quot;gpt3_text_samples&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;John Russell Reynolds (1 November 1829  – 11 March 1907) was an English lexicographer, editor and author.

The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.

Windelband is now mainly remembered for the terms \&quot;nomothetic\&quot; and \&quot;idiographic\&quot;, which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who protested other Neo-Kantians of his time and maintained that \&quot;to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\&quot;. Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.

He is known as a founder in the tradition of Neo-Kantianism and as a teacher of revered thinkers such as Heidegger and Weber. Windelband was a historian of philosophy and a historian of science who, following Kant’s terminology, distinguished between “nomothetic” (generalizing) and “idiographic” (particularizing) approaches. Windelband argued that the two were complementary and that both were necessary for an adequate explanation of complex phenomena. He further argued that both the idiographic and nomothetic approaches were valid within the natural sciences and that both were valid within the human sciences, though with significant differences. Additionally, Windelband was one of the first to recognize the existence of a distinct philosophy of science apart from philosophy of nature and philosophy of history. This led to the development of a distinctively modern form of philosophical dichotomy which is often referred to as “the way of ideas” and “the way of inquiry.&quot;,&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher who is known for his contributions in the fields of neo-Kantianism and (in particular) the history of philosophy. He is considered to be one of the most influential Neo-Kantian philosophers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and is also recognized for his many works on the history of philosophy. He is most commonly associated with the terminology of \&quot;nomic\&quot; and \&quot;idiographic\&quot; knowledge, which he introduced in his book A History of Philosophy (1894). According to Windelband, \&quot;nomic\&quot; knowledge is scientific, while \&quot;idiographic\&quot; knowledge deals with individual phenomena. He argued that history should not be regarded as a science, but as an art. Windelband was also an advocate of value-free philosophy and pioneered the concept of \&quot;value-judgment,\&quot; according to which all such judgments are ultimately subjective. He was a Professor at the universities of Strassburg, Heidelberg and Marburg.&quot;,&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848 – 26 September 1915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy from the Baden region. He studied in Heidelberg and Berlin, was professor of philosophy and rector (1890–1891) at the University of Strassburg, and professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg. He is now better known for the distinction he drew between two different kinds of the history of philosophy, the “history of ideas” (Geschichte der Ideen) and the “history of doctrines” (Geschichte der Lehren). He also introduced two new terms into the philosophical vocabulary: “nomothetic” and “idiographic” which describe two different approaches to the study of the laws and sciences. Windelband's works reflect the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze and Wilhelm Dilthey. He was a neo-Kantian and has been described as “the last great Kantian in Germany.”&quot;,&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of Wilhelmiancheerful disposition and broad philosophical interests, who had a considerable influence in the formation of neo-Kantian thought. He is known in the history of philosophy mainly as a historian of philosophy and as a terminologist. He introduced two terms that are still in active use: \&quot;nomothetic\&quot; and \&quot;idiographic\&quot;. He also introduced a tripartite distinction of logic into theoretical, practical, and aesthetic in order to allow for the non-reducibility of practical and aesthetic meaning. He worked on a wide array of topics in the fields of philosophy and psychology including logic, philosophy of science, history of philosophy, philosophy of religion, psychological histories, and science of the conscious. His most important contributions are in the areas of philosophical history, neo-Kantianism, and hermeneutics.&quot;,&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of the Baden school of neo-Kantianism. He held the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. He is known for introducing the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which are used to differentiate between natural science (nomothetic) and the humanities (idiographic). He argued that the nomothetic-idiographic dichotomy was much more than just a way of distinguishing science from the humanities; it was also a way of expressing the differences in the approaches and objectives of real sciences. Stated simply, the nomothetic approach seeks general laws and theories, whereas the idiographic approach seeks to describe individual phenomena.\n\nWindelband's most important works include Präludien auf den Geist der neueren Philosophie (1878), A History of Philosophy (1888), History of Ancient Philosophy (1895), History of Medieval Philosophy (1896/1901), and Philosophy of History (1901).

He suggested that we can only understand the phenomena of the past if we take into consideration the different evaluations\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (15 January 1848 – 19 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He worked in both the Historical and the Philosophical schools of thought, developing a historical phenomenology. He coined the distinction between \\\&quot;Nomothetic\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;Idiographic\\\&quot; sciences. He is considered one of the greatest neo-Kantian philosophers.\\n\\nWindelband's interests returned to concerns about philosophical method that Kant had formulated. He addressed the problem of relating historical phenomena to general laws. He argued that each \\\&quot;idiographic\\\&quot; science deals with phenomena as individual and irreducible, while a \\\&quot;nomothetic\\\&quot; science abstracts common laws. Windelband's \\\&quot;principle of The Unconditioned\\\&quot; (Das Unbedingte) is an ontological principle of modes of being, by which an explanation of anything must include reference to something unconditioned, that is God. The particular is explicable only through reference to the general, and thus only through the use of nomothetic explanation. Windelband's work emphasized the importance of the history of\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (23 April 1848 – 15 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the Neo-Kantian school. He is known as a founder in the tradition of Neo-Kantianism and as a teacher of revered thinkers such as Heidegger and Weber. Windelband was a historian of philosophy and a historian of science who, following Kant’s terminology, distinguished between “nomothetic” (generalizing) and “idiographic” (particularizing) approaches. Windelband argued that the two were complementary and that both were necessary for an adequate explanation of complex phenomena. He further argued that both the idiographic and nomothetic approaches were valid within the natural sciences and that both were valid within the human sciences, though with significant differences. Additionally, Windelband was one of the first to recognize the existence of a distinct philosophy of science apart from philosophy of nature and philosophy of history. This led to the development of a distinctively modern form of philosophical dichotomy which is often referred to as “the way of ideas” and “the way of inquiry.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher who is known for his contributions in the fields of neo-Kantianism and (in particular) the history of philosophy. He is considered to be one of the most influential Neo-Kantian philosophers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and is also recognized for his many works on the history of philosophy. He is most commonly associated with the terminology of \\\&quot;nomic\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;idiographic\\\&quot; knowledge, which he introduced in his book A History of Philosophy (1894). According to Windelband, \\\&quot;nomic\\\&quot; knowledge is scientific, while \\\&quot;idiographic\\\&quot; knowledge deals with individual phenomena. He argued that history should not be regarded as a science, but as an art. Windelband was also an advocate of value-free philosophy and pioneered the concept of \\\&quot;value-judgment,\\\&quot; according to which all such judgments are ultimately subjective. He was a Professor at the universities of Strassburg, Heidelberg and Marburg.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848 – 26 September 1915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy from the Baden region. He studied in Heidelberg and Berlin, was professor of philosophy and rector (1890–1891) at the University of Strassburg, and professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg. He is now better known for the distinction he drew between two different kinds of the history of philosophy, the “history of ideas” (Geschichte der Ideen) and the “history of doctrines” (Geschichte der Lehren). He also introduced two new terms into the philosophical vocabulary: “nomothetic” and “idiographic” which describe two different approaches to the study of the laws and sciences. Windelband's works reflect the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze and Wilhelm Dilthey. He was a neo-Kantian and has been described as “the last great Kantian in Germany.”\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of Wilhelmiancheerful disposition and broad philosophical interests, who had a considerable influence in the formation of neo-Kantian thought. He is known in the history of philosophy mainly as a historian of philosophy and as a terminologist. He introduced two terms that are still in active use: \\\&quot;nomothetic\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;idiographic\\\&quot;. He also introduced a tripartite distinction of logic into theoretical, practical, and aesthetic in order to allow for the non-reducibility of practical and aesthetic meaning. He worked on a wide array of topics in the fields of philosophy and psychology including logic, philosophy of science, history of philosophy, philosophy of religion, psychological histories, and science of the conscious. His most important contributions are in the areas of philosophical history, neo-Kantianism, and hermeneutics.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of the Baden school of neo-Kantianism. He held the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. He is known for introducing the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which are used to differentiate between natural science (nomothetic) and the humanities (idiographic). He argued that the nomothetic-idiographic dichotomy was much more than just a way of distinguishing science from the humanities; it was also a way of expressing the differences in the approaches and objectives of real sciences. Stated simply, the nomothetic approach seeks general laws and theories, whereas the idiographic approach seeks to describe individual phenomena.\\n\\nWindelband's most important works include Präludien auf den Geist der neueren Philosophie (1878), A History of Philosophy (1888), History of Ancient Philosophy (1895), History of Medieval Philosophy (1896/1901), and Philosophy of History (1901). He was a principal member of the neo-Kantian \\\&quot;Marburg school\\\&quot;\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Wilhelm Windelband (German: [vɪlhɛlm vɪndl̩band]; April 21, 1848 – October 9, 1915) was a German philosopher of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is most well known for introducing two distinctions in philosophical method, which he believed would define the two approaches he identified in philosophic inquiry, the nomothetic-idiographic (N/I) distinction and the distinction between Wissenschaftsgeschichte and Geschichte as “philosophical, ponderous history.” He is seen as one of the founders of neo-Kantianism and was a significant contributor to “Baden School” of Neo-Kantians. Windelband's approach to philosophy had a direct impact on the sciences: he was among the first to introduce the idea of a \\\&quot;categorical imperative\\\&quot; in philosophy of science and sought to impose a logical consistency on the process of inquiry.\&quot;\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;gpt3_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Freddie Frith (1917–1994) was an English motorcycle racer who competed in the Isle of Man TT race&quot;},&quot;wiki_bio_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Frederick Lee \\\&quot;Freddie\\\&quot; Frith OBE (born 30 May 1909 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England – 24 May &quot;},&quot;gpt3_sentences&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;Freddie Frith (1917–1994) was an English motorcycle racer who competed in the Isle of Man TT rac&quot;},&quot;annotation&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;minor_inaccurate\&quot;,\&quot;minor_inaccurate\&quot;,\&quot;minor_inaccurate\&quot;,\&quot;minor_inaccurate\&quot;,\&quot;accurate\&quot;,\&quot;minor_inacc&quot;},&quot;wiki_bio_test_idx&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:61460,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;61,460&quot;},&quot;gpt3_text_samples&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;Freddie Frith (19 October 1924 – 13 March 1981) was an English motorcycle racer and test rider. &quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;gpt3_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Marshall Manesh (born October 24, 1956) is an American actor.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The "Reynolds Baronetcy", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an "Essay on Vertigo"; in 1855 "Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves", as well as "Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 "Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity"; in 1872 "The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the "System of Medicine", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a "Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.</span></div></div>

The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.

He is known as one of the founding fathers of Neo-Kantianism, and was a leader in the development of the concept of value-free science. He emphasized the difference between the History of Nature, which studies the facts of nature, and the History of Humanity, which studies the meaning of human activity and the purpose of life. Windelband used the term \"value-free\" to describe his method. He argued that scientific inquiry was value-free in the sense that scientists should remain impartial and unconcerned with the moral purpose of their work.

He was opposed to the classical empirical-inductive approach proposed by Wilhelm Wundt and his student, Hermann von Helmholtz.

Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who identified in the great systems of modern philosophy a fundamental opposition between the concepts of nomothetic and idiographic knowledge. The former deals in general laws and principles while the latter deals in individual facts. His intellectual project was validated by his being appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1883, which was then one of the major philosophical centers of German-speaking Europe.

He was strongly anti-positivist and his work, in opposition to the naturalism of Ernst Haeckel, advocated a thoroughgoing spiritualism.

He also emphasized the autonomy of particular sciences from one another and from philosophy, and introduced key distinctions such as immanent/transcendent, nomothetic/idiographic, and analytic/synthetic.

He specialized in the philosophies of Immanuel Kant and Hermann Lotze, though his work extended far beyond these figures. Windelband was influenced by the ideas of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and especially his teacher and colleague at the University of Heidelberg, Kuno Fischer. Windelband is remembered for distinguishing between two different types of philosophical inquiry which he called nomothetic and idiographic—the former being the search for general law and the latter for particular facts. These two types of inquiry constitute the two major attitudes possible for philosophy—the two faces of philosophy. Although he was largely unappreciated in his own time, Windelband has become an influential figure in contemporary philosophy. His works have remained in print continually since their initial publication.",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (15 June 1848 – 18 August 1915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy. He was a neo-Kantian who focused on issues of classification, and was one of the major figures in 19th century science and philosophy of science. Windelband is known for distinguishing between two different aspects of the scientific enterprise—the nomothetic and the ideographic. The former occupies itself with the discovery of the general laws that govern the phenomena that are the subject matter of its inquiries, while the latter studies the particular individuals in their uniqueness and particularity. Windelband emphasized the differences between the natural and human sciences and developed the concept of \"value-judgments\" in the interpretation of historical phenomena. \n\nHe emphasized the autonomy of value-laden historical studies and pointed out that not mere “facts” were to be studied, but rather the “meaning” one could attribute to them. Windelband argued that all historical sciences involve the mediation of values, but that values are historically relative. He suggested that we can only understand the phenomena of the past if we take into consideration the different evaluations",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (15 January 1848 – 19 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He worked in both the Historical and the Philosophical schools of thought, developing a historical phenomenology. He coined the distinction between \"Nomothetic\" and \"Idiographic\" sciences. He is considered one of the greatest neo-Kantian philosophers.\n\nWindelband's interests returned to concerns about philosophical method that Kant had formulated. He addressed the problem of relating historical phenomena to general laws. He argued that each \"idiographic\" science deals with phenomena as individual and irreducible, while a \"nomothetic\" science abstracts common laws. Windelband's \"principle of The Unconditioned\" (Das Unbedingte) is an ontological principle of modes of being, by which an explanation of anything must include reference to something unconditioned, that is God. The particular is explicable only through reference to the general, and thus only through the use of nomothetic explanation. Windelband's work emphasized the importance of the history of",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (23 April 1848 – 15 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the Neo-Kantian school. He is known as a founder in the tradition of Neo-Kantianism and as a teacher of revered thinkers such as Heidegger and Weber. Windelband was a historian of philosophy and a historian of science who, following Kant’s terminology, distinguished between “nomothetic” (generalizing) and “idiographic” (particularizing) approaches. Windelband argued that the two were complementary and that both were necessary for an adequate explanation of complex phenomena. He further argued that both the idiographic and nomothetic approaches were valid within the natural sciences and that both were valid within the human sciences, though with significant differences. Additionally, Windelband was one of the first to recognize the existence of a distinct philosophy of science apart from philosophy of nature and philosophy of history. This led to the development of a distinctively modern form of philosophical dichotomy which is often referred to as “the way of ideas” and “the way of inquiry.",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher who is known for his contributions in the fields of neo-Kantianism and (in particular) the history of philosophy. He is considered to be one of the most influential Neo-Kantian philosophers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and is also recognized for his many works on the history of philosophy. He is most commonly associated with the terminology of \"nomic\" and \"idiographic\" knowledge, which he introduced in his book A History of Philosophy (1894). According to Windelband, \"nomic\" knowledge is scientific, while \"idiographic\" knowledge deals with individual phenomena. He argued that history should not be regarded as a science, but as an art. Windelband was also an advocate of value-free philosophy and pioneered the concept of \"value-judgment,\" according to which all such judgments are ultimately subjective. He was a Professor at the universities of Strassburg, Heidelberg and Marburg.",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848 – 26 September 1915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy from the Baden region. He studied in Heidelberg and Berlin, was professor of philosophy and rector (1890–1891) at the University of Strassburg, and professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg. He is now better known for the distinction he drew between two different kinds of the history of philosophy, the “history of ideas” (Geschichte der Ideen) and the “history of doctrines” (Geschichte der Lehren). He also introduced two new terms into the philosophical vocabulary: “nomothetic” and “idiographic” which describe two different approaches to the study of the laws and sciences. Windelband's works reflect the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze and Wilhelm Dilthey. He was a neo-Kantian and has been described as “the last great Kantian in Germany.”",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of Wilhelmiancheerful disposition and broad philosophical interests, who had a considerable influence in the formation of neo-Kantian thought. He is known in the history of philosophy mainly as a historian of philosophy and as a terminologist. He introduced two terms that are still in active use: \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic\". He also introduced a tripartite distinction of logic into theoretical, practical, and aesthetic in order to allow for the non-reducibility of practical and aesthetic meaning. He worked on a wide array of topics in the fields of philosophy and psychology including logic, philosophy of science, history of philosophy, philosophy of religion, psychological histories, and science of the conscious. His most important contributions are in the areas of philosophical history, neo-Kantianism, and hermeneutics.",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) was a German philosopher of the Baden school of neo-Kantianism. He held the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. He is known for introducing the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which are used to differentiate between natural science (nomothetic) and the humanities (idiographic). He argued that the nomothetic-idiographic dichotomy was much more than just a way of distinguishing science from the humanities; it was also a way of expressing the differences in the approaches and objectives of real sciences. Stated simply, the nomothetic approach seeks general laws and theories, whereas the idiographic approach seeks to describe individual phenomena.\n\nWindelband's most important works include Präludien auf den Geist der neueren Philosophie (1878), A History of Philosophy (1888), History of Ancient Philosophy (1895), History of Medieval Philosophy (1896/1901), and Philosophy of History (1901). He was a principal member of the neo-Kantian \"Marburg school\"",
  "Wilhelm Windelband (German: [vɪlhɛlm vɪndl̩band]; April 21, 1848 – October 9, 1915) was a German philosopher of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is most well known for introducing two distinctions in philosophical method, which he believed would define the two approaches he identified in philosophic inquiry, the nomothetic-idiographic (N/I) distinction and the distinction between Wissenschaftsgeschichte and Geschichte as “philosophical, ponderous history.” He is seen as one of the founders of neo-Kantianism and was a significant contributor to “Baden School” of Neo-Kantians. Windelband's approach to philosophy had a direct impact on the sciences: he was among the first to introduce the idea of a \"categorical imperative\" in philosophy of science and sought to impose a logical consistency on the process of inquiry."
