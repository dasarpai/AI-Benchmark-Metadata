He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.\n\n[Verse 1: JAY-Z]\nThey say \&quot;They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.\&quot;\nSo on that note, I'm leavin' after this song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long\nBut at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves\nWho made love under the sycamore tree\nWhich makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain\nAlthough through the years I gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here\nShe knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care\nBut I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear\nNow I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted\nBut I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\n[Interlude: Gloria Carter]\nShawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.\n\n[Verse 2: JAY-Z]\nNow, all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me\nSo, with that disdain in my membrane\nGot on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came\nThen DeHaven introduced me to the game\nSpanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd\nAnd all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now\nMy self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag\nGot a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had\nSupposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass\nI'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap\nBut that came second to me movin' this crack\n\&quot;Gimme a second, I swear,\&quot; I would say about my rap career\n'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!\n\n[Interlude: Gloria Carter]\nShawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.\n\n[Verse 3: JAY-Z]\nGoodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush\nYour blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush\nAnd you in a drop, you're so easy to touch\nNo two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much\nAnd \&quot;trust\&quot; is a word you seldom hear from us\nHustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up\nAnd the drought will define a man when the well dries up\nYou learn the worth of water without work\nYou thirst 'til you die, yup!\nAnd niggas get tied up for product\nAnd little brothers' ring fingers get cut up\nTo show mothers they really got 'em\nAnd this was the stress I lived with\n'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven\nFor every bad decision I made, every sister I played\nâ€˜Cause I'm still paranoid to this day\nAnd it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made\nThis is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me\n[Outro: JAY-Z]\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nNow if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;14&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;98 Freestyle&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rap&quot;},&quot;lyrics&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[Verse 1]\nYo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich\nI'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks\nAnd I'm all about expanding my chips\nYou mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch\nWith both hands on her tits\nCorleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart\nI got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp\nA while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park\nCounting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark\nForever hottie hunting\nTrigger temper, I'm quick to body something\nYou looking at me like I'm probably fronting\nI fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest\nI'm older and smarter, this is me at my best\nI stopped hanging around y'all\n'Cause niggas like you be praying on my downfall\nHoping I flop, hoping I stop\nYou probably even hope I get locked\nOr be on the street corner with a pipe, smoking the rock\nI got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you\nOnly thing I haven't got is more stitches than you\nFucking punk, you ain't a leader, what?

night breeze\nWherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze\nSliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice Vs\nDressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey\nIt's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell\nUrban hell, playing park benches, burning Ls\nIt's all basics, probation, open cases\nWe ill-natured, being trained young from hatred\nTrapped in the arms of Satan, congregating\nConversating, trying to map ways of escaping\nIt's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere\nKeep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs\n[Chorus: SWV]\nHey, AZ, won't you play

low fade, waves laid and spinning\nStay paid four different ways, put my bid in\nNo sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep\nThese cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth\nTrying to stay sane amongst the madness and maintain\nThough the game changed, the message involved remained plain\nPoor advice given, we all strive for nice living\nInsights, some pay the price, others spend nights in prison\nPlea bargain, hoping my peoples peep the problem\nWe each dissolving trying to make moves to keep from starving\n[Chorus: SWV]\nHey, AZ, won't you play that song?\nKeep me fucked up (Fucked

With the goons I spar, stay in tune with ma (What up?)
She like, "Damn, this the realest since 'Kumbaya'"
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my Lord (My Lord)
Still the man with the pan, scrilla, fam, on board
Now bitches, they want to neuter me, niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's, maneuvering's nothing new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind, pan-pan: gram or dime?
Not toes or MC when I say "hammer time"
Beef: I hammer mine, when I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line, Corduroys, Cam'll shine
Canary burgundy: I call it "Lemon Red" (Red)
Yellow diamonds in my ear, call 'em "Lemonheads"
Lemonhead, end up dead, ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flintstones, you could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy, scrappy? (What's going on, Scrappy?)
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm "Tacky Daddy," Range look like Laffy Taffy

Yo, I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up? (Killa!)
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes (Killa!)
Welcome to Harlem, where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang!
Came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, "ooh he ring!"
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put them in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'ma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh
Yes sir, please confess
Just say he's the best (Killa!)

(Killa!) Yo
How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff? (everything)
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit (millions)
You a rooster nigga, just a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes
It's me, sing! Killa, uhh

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
"I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure."
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
"Let's do this," it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS â€” you see me stressed, right?

[Chorus]
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?</span></div></div>

And they can't afford chrome so they puttin Vaseline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club
And dont pass my green or my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every "K" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor
Gotta pull it on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Hook]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
[Verse 2]
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the scope its gonna blam
The infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)</span></div></div>

[Intro: Cam'ron &amp; Kanye West]
Ugh, Killa!
Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated
On murders, premeditatedâ€”absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa, so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back
[Chorus: Kanye West &amp; (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina; put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was "Touch Me, Tease Me" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!
[Chorus: Kanye West &amp; (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ugh, Killa, yo, yo, ayoâ€”
You dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice your face, you're it!
It's I who come by, drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached herâ€”"Hi, boo, how you?
Pony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good, maâ€”I fly too"
Now, a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture, though; you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said "I told you so"
Ugh, Killa!
[Chorus: Kanye West &amp; (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Outro: Cam'ron]
Mine! Killa!
You already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis
Chicago, of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside, wild hundreds
You know what it is, Ohio
Columbus, holla at your boy
You know what else I do:
Dayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati</span></div></div>

They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like, "Keep your dough," he got your ho
And the sun shines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the Birdman and I been shining ever since, like that</span></div></div>

Haha
Uh-huh
No homo (Young Mula, baby!)
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, "How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, "Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need four more hoes, we need oh, oh, oh, oh!
You know what it is when we out of town
We balling too serious, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fucking with the best in the world
[Break: Kanye West &amp; Static Major]
Lollipop
The best in the world
Sh-Sh-She lick me like a lollipop
World, world
Sheâ€” She lick me like a lollipop

[Chorus: Static Major, Lil Wayne, &amp; Both]
Shawty want a thug, thug, thug
Bottles in the club, club, club (Bottles in the club)
Shawty wanna hump (Shawty wanna)
You know I like to touch (Shawty wanna)
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps (Shawty wanna)
Shawty want a thug (I like that)
Bottles in the club (Hey, I like that)
Shawty wanna hump (I like that, haha!)
You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I Anita-bake her; now, she caught up in that "Rapture"
I got so much chips, I swear, they call me "Hewlett Packard"
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother-fudge cake; now, tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sakeâ€”soo-woo!
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy itâ€”remix!
[Chorus: Static Major, Lil Wayne, &amp; Both]
Shawty want a thug, thug, thug (Shawty want a thug, yeah!)
Bottles in the club, club, club (Bottles in the club, yeah!)
Shawty wanna hump (Yeah! Shawty wanna)
You know I like to touch (Yeah! Shawty wanna)
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps (Shawty wanna)
Shawty want a thug (I like that)
Bottles in the club (Hey, I like that)
Shawty wanna hump (I like that, haha!)
You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
â€‹iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
Haha! So wrap it up!
Bu-Bu-But he's so sweet, sh-she wanna lick the wrapper

[Chorus: Static Major &amp; Lil Wayne]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club, club, club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps (Re-Re-Re-Remix, baby!)
[Outro: Static Major]
Lick me like a lollipop (Lollipop)
Sheâ€” She lick me like a lollipop (L-Lollipop)
Sh-Sh-Sh-She lick me like a lollipop (Lollipop)
Sheâ€” She lick me like a lollipop (Lollipop)</span></div></div>

No, no, no!
I told you, I lived this shit
I ain't up here just rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit
Naw, uh-uh, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you, rapper
I'm not you, Pusha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse 3: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, "Wow, that didn't look like my man"
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the 40 up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain "Super Nigga," I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men
[Verse 4: Styles P]
Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on
Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor?
You wouldn't understand, cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Verse 5: Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, "No, I move coke" (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live for my kids and theirs and them youngins after that</span></div></div>

Killa, Dipset
Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflÃ© ya toupÃ©e and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me

[Chorus: Nicole Wray &amp; Cam'ron]
We in a zone, our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we 'bout to make the drums cry
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
We hold our own, don't think you can move us or push us
We step to the side, that's why I call this family ties
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa! Uhh
From the back of the cop-ride
To black-on-black, black when we cop rides
I will not hide, "hi ma, hot thighs"
Dick on her nose...now she's cock-eyed
From whippin' the bacon rolls to outside whippin' the bacon Rolls
Sanaa Lathan knows, I'm rakin' but makin' dough
80 holes in your shirt, there: your own Jamaican clothes
I ain't talkin' the Poconos, I'm talkin' the Aspens, to slopes we go
You get the "okey doke", play me, baby I hope he know
We break noses, call him baby Pinocchio
(Fuckin' liar), I hold him with blue mittens
2 pigeons, "what the fuck are you pitchin'?"
1 house, 2 kitchens...who's bitchin'?
I bring the diesel, won't see the Fu-Schnickens
(And I don't trust a hoe)
That's mother to baby-mother
Motherfucker, you look like a lady-lover
I'll touch slap her, dap her, plus clap her
Tell her drink, come get drunk, it's nut cracker
And it's well known that Rell home
Yup, hit E.T up on the cell phone
As your family dies, and my family rise
Call the network, Dipset, Family Ties (Killa)
[Chorus: Nicole Wray &amp; Cam'ron]
We in a zone, our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we 'bout to make the drums cry
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
We hold our own, don't think you can move us or push us
We step to the side, that's why I call this family ties
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
They see me in that lavender tank, you'd rather just faint
I was Fort Laudi, you was Saint Latter-Day Saints
Whips get lathered in paint
Rap with the rappers, scrap with the actors, cap back: abracadabra
And I'm appalled think that we at all comfortable
Me in Mauris, these rappers all Theodore Huxtable
They mother's a lawyer, they father's a doctor
Auction coke to the coppers, Glocks in the locker and
Who you supposed to be? Get hung from the rosaries
Call me "C.O.D." - that's coke and them Os of D
Some OD'ed, B off them Os of D
I ain't give a fuck as long as they ain't close to me
Put ya drugs in the air, give a toast to me
Pump that Dip in ya veins, get dope like me
Fuck Kerry and Bush, you should vote for me
For real, nigga, on the real the last hope is me
[Chorus: Nicole Wray &amp; Cam'ron]

Ay yo you wonder who I are
I guzzle up at the bar
But you see me in the cars that start with the double R
Range Rover, Rolls Royce, even got a Rocky Rolly
See more ice than a hockey goalie
Baby eating guacamole
I did without
Now I live it out
Cars? got to whip it out
Every year I get it out
(Why?) I be long gone
(Where?) probably Hong Kong
Girls with their thong on
I'm playing Don Juan
Drinking Chandon
Where the chron, ma?
"You smoke weed?" "What you think, girl? Uh-huh!"
Start the car up
Take her on a long ride
Yo she think my steering wheel on the wrong side
No I'm sorry
This is the Ferrari
Limon like Bacardi
Rock with safari
But la di da di
We like to party
And every night, believe, we gon' leave with somebody
[Hook]
We was rockin' and rollin'
Now we rollin' and smokin'
On the phone and we chokin'
While you strollin' and hopin'
For the tone which you spoke in
And I know that you're open
Live a Branson life and a brand new 5
Hot man, God damn, Killa Cam be live

[Verse 2]
Ay yo come on, girlfriend I ain't no actor, really
So when you come around here don't be acting silly
Askin "did he?"
Come on I got the baddest biddies
Ass is pretty
Like hoes down in Magic City
Now you smoke hoes and the coco
Niggas say I'm loco
Cause I'm low low from the po-po
Every night I stroke hoes
No-no for homos
F doing promos
I was Def already I just added the So-So
Wherever we at
Ready to act
Better be strapped
I live the life of Riley
Whether Teddy or Pat
And when it come to the cash
Bet I'm heavy with that
If your man want to bet
Then I bet he be cracked
And your little girlfriend
She was wet off the bat
From the Chevy tonight;
Yo, I'll bet she be back
For the one night stand
Yeah, the sex in the sack
Yo I ask her if she miss it
Then I tell her to kiss it
Come on
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ay yo your girl around me? That's like sand to a beach
Or a gram to a ki or a branch to a tree
Your money? That's my advance to a G
And you'll see me and Lance to the B
Yeah acting wild
Jimmy back me, child
How long you think an ounce gonna last me now?
But I love when hoes call me
"The Cat's Meow"
Cause I run up in them and I make their cats meow
Are you hip to the jive?
How we get to the thighs?
Half of my game? Yo, that shit be a lie
But it's true about Duke from the hoop to the 5
And I'm right behind him in a coupe that we drive
Baby am I slick
Oh your friends are sick
To see me and my chicks in DKNY kicks
And my clique
Yo we get the dank and bounce
And put another half a mil in my bank account</span></div></div>

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
With my muscle you'll be dazzled, but hustlin's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face-to-face through the glass
On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-11, but it was 9-1-1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dumb

Ayo, them niggas from the three two, said I can't breeze through
The 40 if I cop bottles, we can't believe you
Me who? Please boo, landin' in that G2
Same color as beef stew, favorite letters: GQ
That's me, true, peach/blue, Hebrew
Lawyer on my side keep me out of jail the fees stew, steep? Woo!
But it might lead to that R2D2, the mobsters creep through
We the new PE, shittin, pee-ew
To the hood: y'all don't need me, I need you
'Cause my mission's insane, you couldn't vision the pain
Always a snitch in the game, what you want: prison or fame?
Either one, dun, long as my digits the same
He lookin' frigid, dig it, make sure them digits get changed
'Cause I can't be in Hell's cell, shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell, Zeek doin' 3, he even fell, hell
He comin' home on '07 and 12 cells
'Cause you must have known, I can't trust the phones
For the dough you'll be like Doe, stuck at home

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Nowadays dog, they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze 'em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost ark
I'm like a ballplayer, shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box
More props, R.I.P. my poor pops
Can't see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers, you'll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers, cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches, Nana to watch Grandma
In pajamas I snuck out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa, you gon' watch Santana

[Chorus: Jaheim]
Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right

It gets better I know, tell you, I know
[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate, little fence - I climbed over
Little scrapes, little dents - I got over
That was just the beginning it's not over
It's been a long time comin' Cam
It's been a long time riding and a long time running, man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino, Gee Money, The Carter, and the Duh-Duh Man
It's no longer a New Jack City
It's "cop fast and move that quickly" or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap, man, I'm coming up this road
I'm talking crack, man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I receive it move it and roll
I was comin' from the Q, Zeek was comin' from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the paper-run
Yeah, waiting for a change to come
Now look: the change has come
The 7-Pick Up, Yukon, the Range is come
The day has come, Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers
In this game, we remain, it's a shame cuz</span></div></div>

Holler at your motherfuckin' boy, JR (Brr)
Birdman my pa, bitch, ball bred, born rich (Yeah)
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed 'cause my toilet paper thick
I know
But trip and that 40 make a chip out a potato-head wimp
Then like ranch, I dip (Gone)
And the hustle is all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight, I don't struggle, I just lift (One, two)
I got my hand on the game, yeah, I make a grip (Yeah)
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get key money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist (Haha)

Nigga get it in a slumber if you know how (Uh)
In the heart of the summer, we need a snowplow
What you know 'bout that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it blowjobs (Yeah)
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch, gettin' sloppy with the pots (Bitch)
Hoppin' off the boat, meetin' papi at the docks (What up?)
He tell me I'm gainin' weight, I tell him I'm gettin' paid (Yeah)
Money over bitches, I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age (What?), go after what pays (Yeah)
These Gabbana sunshades block the sun rays (Bitch)
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date (Damn)
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way (Yeah)
That cake, like it's, it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, you heard me?
Where money's more important than a person, nigga

[Verse 3]
Twisting up a blunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar (Okay)
I'm digging in the game, tryna get some money out her (Okay)
I'm so vain, it's a problem (Yeah)
There ain't a stain on these Pradas (Uh-uh)
I'm just bein' modest (Yeah)
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it (Bitch)
She still down and she don't get none of the profit (Yeah)
Wheel 'round the city, let the tints hide me

Giddy up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up, baby (Yeah)
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough, baby (Yeah)
I love it, I fuckin' love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public (Hah)
Ridin' to myself, 'cause I don't fuck with nothin'
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money

You ain't never seen a nigga this large
Motherfuck the house, the nigga's garage is as big as the projs
I move from city to city like a nigga at large
Smooth as Billy D, but it's Jigga's da bars
Like you really gon' get me
You look hard, but on the inside you softer than a silicon titty
The chilla's wrong with me
You can look at the kid and see just how them Chinchillas gonna fit me
I strut through like I conceal a chrome with me
Pockets bulgin like I got some millions with me
Any bitch that chill or jones with me
End up butt ass naked inside a Villa home with me
I got a ziplock the killer grown with me
A hit of this Bobby 'll let me feel up on Whitney
Justin will cry rivers like he feel I boned Britney
I really don't get me, I really won't get me
YEAH!

[Hook]
I think y'all know by now that I ain't nothin' to be fucked with
I think y'all know by now that I don't care 'bout who you fuck with
I think hoes know by now that I'm that nigga they should bump with
I think y'all know by now it's F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
[Verse 2]
I'm often asked, HEY, ain't you that guy
There's no one else from head to ankle that fly
Who put slugs point blank through that guy
And there's nothin' that these dudes ain't do that I, can't do at my
Earliest convenience, your girlie ain't been seen since
The feature with Lil' Mo, over 2 million people, I've reached with my little flow
They said sounded like the kid's speech was a little slow (uh huh, uh huh)
Personally I think they was reachin' a little though
But now they callin' just to get a feature so it'll blow
I'm teachin' my little bro
To stay on the grind and away from the leeches and little hoes
I use the Black Star Power on broads
Even devil worshippers gotta bow to the God
I know all you cowards, it's hard
Your career's dead so I send flowers and cards
Without regards, nigga

[Hook]
I think y'all know by now that I ain't nothin' to be fucked with

I think hoes know by now that I'm that nigga they should bump with

[Outro]
Uh, uh, nigga

Who the fuck I be
Uh, yeah, but um
I'm with that S-T-R-E-E-T-F-A-M-I-L-Y

[Verse 1]
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked â€“ that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

[Verse 2]
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

[Verse 3]
My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like, "Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!"
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off â€“ Momma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers
Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone."
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
"Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
â€˜Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...</span></div></div>

Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting
Trigger temper, I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter, this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all
'Cause niggas like you be praying on my downfall
Hoping I flop, hoping I stop
You probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader, what? Nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should've swallowed you
You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'mma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like "Dammit, this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
[Verse 2]
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeahâ€¦ Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo, check it, yo, my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you, but with that cheap shit, you ainâ€™t worth stickin'
Iâ€™ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'mma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, Iâ€™m not in the mood, son, so donâ€™t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight â€” gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
Itâ€™s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
Iâ€™mma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smoking
My album is done, so no, there ain't no parts open
Iâ€™m not a sweet stud, Iâ€™m a street thug
Thatâ€™s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week, bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ainâ€™t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you withâ€”fuck them too, Iâ€™ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal Street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fucking chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, Iâ€™mma take you out your misery
And after this, nigga
Put you in the social study book 'cause youâ€™re history</span></div></div>

Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch you

[Hook: Pusha T &amp; Birdman]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy? (Ayy)
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Ugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Ugh! The rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord:
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like "Thriller"
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon, so
Quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix-and-matchin', fella

[Hook: Pusha T &amp; Birdman]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy? (Ayy)
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy (Ayy, ayy)
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy? (Ayy)
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy (Ayy, ayy)

[Outro: Birdman]
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
There it is, niggaâ€”there you have it (You know)
Birdman, Clipse, you under-smell?
VA (VA), you know?
Uptown nigga (Uptown, ride out)
We go anywhere with this bullshit (Anywhere with this bullshit)
We flip bricks, you under-smell? (Gangster, motherfucker)
Ayy, nigga, put this puzzle together
Ayy, Pharrell, you did it this year, nigga (You did it, nigga)
Thousand pieces (Uh-huh), puzzles (Star Trak), hundred, you know
Let's get this money (Yeah, let's get the money, baby)
Hey nigga, I smell something! Coca leaf plants, bitch (Coca leaf plants, you under-smell? Let's get the money, biatch!)
Get money, motherfucker (Biatch!)
However you want it, you can get it, pimp
From gangster to blood, nigga, take it how you want it, nigga
We get it how we live
Ain't nothin' but the thug thing, nigga
Money thing, motherfucker</span></div></div>

[Verse 1]
Yo, show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah
Place shutter down, who the fuck'll fuck around?
Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumping
Like eight blacks, four crackers, get your ass jumped
Cris' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker
Go against Jigga your ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch moving I fuck
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what
Nigga what?
[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop

[Verse 2]
Separate myself from the lame, no you can't see me
I'm 6-0-0, you 300 C-E
Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ; "Hee-hee!"
Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth
Niggas said, "Bryan leave your cousin in the house"
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprainsâ€”absolutely! What!
[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop, pop

[Verse 3]
.38 revolve like the sun round the Earth
Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found round your shirt
(Crying) In surround sound from the hearse
Jiggaman, trigger man, hit your man up
Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up
Timbaland, hot shit, get them hands up

[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop

Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a car, new estate
Nah, fuck it get the beef and brocs: blue and gray
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Killa never let the drama slide
Y'all gon' hear a nigga momma die
Yell out "homicide"

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, 18 months? Please, that ain't facing time
I'm stressed anyway, need it for vacation time
I'ma do the right thing though, take shock anyway
6 months, right back on the damn block anyway
But look, money from across the street
Think it's sweet, think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And 5-0 they work for us, walk the beat
Walk with heat 'cause talk is cheap
So dun stay silent
Revolvers, automatics, guns stay silent
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent
Remember me, ODB, I'm the one from Violence, Killa
Digital ten, shit get critical friend
I got 800 invisible men
That mean it could be the bank-man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank, fam
Lady at the frank stand'll
Rat poison your relish right in the center, babe
Bitch is a renegade, she'll piss in your lemonade!
And y'all dead now
That you can bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now, hate when I gotta rep, clowns, blow TEC rounds
In a collision, I see their ambition
But they don't know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was 90 I fried
350 on the stove and it's 90 outside
I'ma get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her, she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died, her-on overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her, older man fucking her sis
But love my music, say I do nothing but hits
She'll do anything for me, nothing but hits
'Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke, needed dope, yeah, I gave her a fix
So she went across the street, gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out, flirted, played with his dick
"You know Cam?" He said, "yeah", "Don't play with his chips"
Stood back, blazed him with 6, amazing and shit
Huh, Killa, Killa, Dipset nigga
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yo, fuck losing weight
We back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Take my moms, move away
Yeah, I think I'ma cop me that new estate
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me
Until the shots get me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Niggas wanna know why I'm so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire, it's real dog, I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie, in the midst of the fire
Break work, put it in pots, sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off, I'm hitting your tires
Hittin' your door while your car's spinning, hitting the wall
That's just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villains'll finish you off
Head in your chest, brain-
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC, wave
Niggas like "fuck, is he stupid?" (Yes I am)
Cops wanna cuff me, do it
You wanna be a hero, snuff me, do it, rush me, do it
Shit, like I ain't been through the scars and bruises
Like I ain't been through the bars, seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body, I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot, I done lost so much weight
I'm telling Papi "front me a brick, let me owe that cake"
He telling me he ain't got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
I'm like "at least give me a half, I'll compress it and stretch it to one"
I'm on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops that's moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use â€˜case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked, screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger duke'll circle round your body like hula-hoops (woo!)
Mami told me son, hold your own
And one day you gon' grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her...
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me...
[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes

Huh! Watch this y'all
It's  Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!
It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!
'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah
I'm really like that

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply "I will not lose!"
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return
[Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)]
How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How right is your dough?  ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How white is your blow?  ('Cause I'm like that yo)

How tight is your flow? (Just like that yo)
How right is your dough? (Just like that, huh)
How white is your blow? (Uh huh, 'cause I'm like that)
Only, write what you know (Watch this, yeah, watch this yo)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin' the pump
Spittin' a couple of curse words, and hittin' you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin' problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha)
Rappers y'all, runnin' around like I won't gun ya down
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around
Lord, accept this offerin' here's somethin' for your crown (please)
I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won

Put your hands up, get your hands in the air
Put your hands up, get 'em up, everybody put 'em up come on!

Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church!" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott &amp; Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Chorus: Sha-ron Prescott &amp; JAY-Z]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', chyeah)
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeahâ€¦ And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above statusâ€“quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne &amp; Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve</span></div></div>

1986 a motherfucker doing tricks in the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but getting grits with black steel firesticks
Trying to build an Empire something like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nothing but a mean mug
(But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs)
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
(Treatin his sisters like a hooker) Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take pounds
Of soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protected wads of gorgeous green
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a ki
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a ki (there's a ki) but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
(So stoop down) bend over (hurry pick it up fast)
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

[HOOK]
[Verse 2 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
Knock knock (who is it?) time to visit but it's two years late
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat ends, got some more friends, (and a brand new Benz)
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch (and a chair is still a chair)
But a house is now a crackhouse, Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, taken from these dead residence
Trying in vain to kill their pain, exchanging dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlez francoise (I don't speak it but I know it)
It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists, I can't survive and not be ruthless
(So while we scrape, and scratch for bones
And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
Cause they don't let, black folks own)
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

[HOOK]

(Ahaha, yeah, what was I fidna say?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County, man)
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee, aight?

[Verse 3 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
(Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper)
Well Lonzo says the County is the slip-up, trip-up, stuck-up
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, but dig it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, "Here's the ticket"
(Now he's addicted) to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, "Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us for revolutionary ruckus
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
We'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels</span></div></div>

Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, itâ€™s another club banger
Got ya' hanginâ€™ on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre &amp; Eminem]
Timeâ€™s up, gameâ€™s over, you lose, IÂ win
â€™Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look whoâ€™s got you goinâ€™ crazy again
Iâ€™m a trend, I set one every time Iâ€™m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once youâ€™re gone, you donâ€™t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, youâ€™re off the map now, radar canâ€™t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playinâ€™ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissinâ€™ and moaninâ€™, whining and bitchinâ€™
Sit and observe, listen, youâ€™ll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, weâ€™re on the charts with a bullet, and still climbinâ€™

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot, and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre &amp; Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I donâ€™t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockinâ€™ off the hinges
We ainâ€™t showinâ€™ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressinâ€™?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, â€™cause Doc left you all guessinâ€™
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gonâ€™ have this motherfucker hoppinâ€™ in a second (Bump, bump!)
Thatâ€™s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
â€™Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasnâ€™t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
Thatâ€™s why we came toâ€¦

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Itâ€™s no secret, everybody know
When Dreâ€™s involved, thereâ€™s plenty of money involved
And plenty honeyâ€™s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8Â Mile alleys
Letâ€™s rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dreâ€™s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, banginâ€™ out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never â€™cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better

I know this stupid bitch who think she know me
She even wanna call me Blaze Her Dead Homie
Bitch keep ya mouth shut cause ya foo dang
Couldn't hold my balls, couldn't hold my wang
Stank hoes wanna see me in the grave
But I'm quick to slap a trick wit a 12 gauge
You know you was speakin my name, playin games
And sayin things you know he's actin like something changed
But I know you are reppin your fancy car
Little money, foo dangin at the tittie bar (Bitch!)
7 dicks shoved in her box nightly, is she fucking?
(Is she fuckin?) For the right price she might me
Stank hoe, I never paid for ass
So take a stray cat, and shove it in ya flat ass
Get up out my face wit that foo dang drama
Where she learn that shit? Man she get it from her mama

Bad boy on the streets, startin static since the '80s
So why you gotta front? Try and play me like a punk
If you keep talkin shit, you gon' end up in my trunk
Jackin beats from bustas, we foo dang like that
Robbin hoes for they gold then trade it in for a sack
Don't even think for a second that we high class
40 drinkin freaks with some dank and a nice ass
? identity with some eastside conflict
Bitches make me sick if they don't foo dang dick
Keep it real and I'll try to keep it real back
Try to trip in over all the bodies that I shot wit the gat
Hunt you down wit my automobile, roll down the window slow
Then punch you right in the throat
Type of shit that most people call a little fucked
But it's simple and plain, we foo dang, so don't front

And I'll slap ya wit a bat like a G should (Beeitch!!)

Keyser SÃ¶ze intention
Glide in a Hummer wit the flying saucer engine
Willied out, at my crib in the winter having cookouts
Smack my wiz, look out
I'm like Barnabas, crab niggas trying to conquer us
They mad 'cause we jump out of cabs and hop on the bus
Copping dust, Firm Clique rock the whole Metropolis
Bitches who burn dick won't put a stop to us
Niggas who-

[Intro: AZ]
See; this is what I mean
When we come together like this incredible things take place
See we connect thoughts to collect shorts
And only the strong survive
I love my black people, we are the future
[Nina Simone sample]
Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair

[Verse 1: AZ]
Chop the pie up four ways, get lyed up
Infiltrate, never violate, get tied up
It's all a chess game, choose sides, the best remains
True Lies, vibes die when bums infest the game
Bogus shit shock you broke and let your man get locked
I live this Hip Hop, stock the bank let the crys pop
Peep the next shit, push a big Benz, fuck a Lexus
The streets was hectic so I stacked and made my exit
More dough to get focused, my thoughts for me to go legit
Ferocious shit, cop a huge castle on a ocean cliff
Imagine that a few years back I was bagging cracks
Magnum gats playing street corners, committing savage acts
Twisting up, nothing but love for niggas sitting up
Hold your own, try coming home without getting touched
Two for one laws made foul how they do the young
Was new to come, try to tell shorty he should of threw the gun

{"Black is the color of my true love's hair"}

[Verse 2: Half-A-Mil]
Knowledge the green Wallys, all I see
My mind hold math like caller ID, chose the path that chose me
I'ma tell you like G-O-D told me
Greed, lust, hate and envy, sweet dust from shanty
Keeps us from simply unifying organizing
We all are falling when we think we all are rising
We pop Cris' on the horizon, topless chicks with thick thighs and
I rather be civilizing, enterprising, improvising
Temperature rising, Elohim gave me the guidance
Told me, "Leave those 85ers alone, blend with the wise men"
That bought 80 G stones, twin Mercedes on homes
Fuck it, just spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die they'll take my chromosomes and clone clones
208 bones, microchip kids, we most dominant
You know what time it is, that's why I exist
Jump out of limo, lands, fire at the place
Why are scientists supplying this Leviathan, why this?
I'm surviving this quiet tribalness
Finalist year 2000 flying the whips
9 cent, mind bent, 1999 rhyme alignment
{"Black is the color of my true love's hair"}

[Verse 3: Nature]
We went from arraignments to entertainment
24/Sev the same shit playing the strip, living dangerous
Bottle after bottle soon became a ritual
The patterns we follow, others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious as to what my hobby is
The root of all evil pollute same niggas body kids
Getting caught up, the same gang that left 'em all stuck
I reminisce on VS touching my fourth cup
Me my only problem is I'm all fucked
Knowing in my heart I can't sleep 'til I bust off nuts
Weave religion for all my niggas that beat the system
And those bitten sitting since ColecoVision
Y'all need to listen, it's journalistic
Y'all hear the whispers, the niggas in the Firm is twisted
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome 6 up the FDR, it's bless we are
See, I never let them stress me God, forever stress-free
While twisting up logs of that nestle
Who are you to question me?
It's just my destiny to kick back, kill time and live successfully

[Outro: AZ]

Talk to me, we give it to y'all either way
We working with y'all, this is for you!

Yo when times get trifle

See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change
[Chorus]

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed

She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
&amp; though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth &amp; days
&amp; though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's "Doe or Die" till I'm dead

[Chorus]

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit
The last of these real reps left turned legit
[Chorus]</span></div></div>

At the ripe age of 24, I done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time, winter, spring, summer, fall
It's crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages
Stockin' caps, summer jobs, pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be coppin' crack
I ain't knockin' that, unfortunately, life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons
Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up
Came home to the same damn dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time - it still ticks when you gone

[Verse 2: Nas]
For those who live the way I live, we came a long way
From wipin' cold outta eyelids to rap's hottest
Smokin' lye, let track guide us
Remember back then before MAC-10's, expensive bottles?
Had a sick mind, niggas taught me how to get mine
We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?
With my luck, soon as I reach the gate, they make me pay
Pray, minutes go by, Indigo high
The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then
Now, leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle
[Verse 3: AZ]
Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I iced the face of my watch</span></div></div>

What's the deal, son?
It's the world famous AZ Show (For the world), AZ Show, Show, Show

[Verse 1: AZ]
No doubt, time to mellow out, party at the yellow house
Yell it out, invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laid back with the AlizÃ©, millis concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit, stressed out, supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, squeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizarre nights, move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing, knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that choose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains
[Chorus: SWV]
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)

[Verse 2: AZ]
So many deaf and blind got caught up and left behind
I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low-keying
Me and the crew in the gold BM ODing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice Vs
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning Ls
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill-natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs
[Chorus: SWV]
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)

[Post-Chorus: SWV]
Long
Long

[Bridge: SWV &amp; AZ]
AZ, knock me out my dog gone shoes (For the world)

[Verse 3: AZ]
No more case pending, it's all a brand new beginning
AZ, I'm back winning, dressed in black linen
Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remained plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living
Insights, some pay the price, others spend nights in prison
Plea bargain, hoping my peoples peep the problem
We each dissolving trying to make moves to keep from starving
[Chorus: SWV]
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up (Fucked up) all night (All night)

[Outro: SWV]
Fucked up all night
Fucked up all night
Hey, AZ
Fucked up all night
Hey, AZ
Fucked up all night
Long (Fucked up all night)
Long (Fucked up all night)
Hey, AZ, won't you play that song?
Keep me fucked up all night</span></div></div>

See these broads, I like 'em and shit
Wish I could give all these hoes a picture-of-my dick
See I like em and psyche em, then I get in the win
I might just need you and leave you at a quarter past ten, but
I ain't gonna lie, your pussy was good
But your mouth is better so I wish you would
Work your way down to the diznick
It feels so good when you do the liznick
You got me doing push-ups and I'm taking ginseng
(Let's get ready to rumble!) In the middle of the ring
You got my dick hard like a '57 Chevy
Rocked up, ya cocked up, cause I'm ready
To go up in ya, let that other nigga send ya
Cards and shit while you suckin' my dick
I like you a little bit more than I'm diggin' my shirt
Ya little pretty ass dick suckin' expert, beeyoch!

See I love these broads but I toss em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique
See I love these broads but I toss em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique
[Verse 2: Birdman]
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could love 'em all
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could fuck 'em all
These broads, I let these hoes just drive my car
But these hoes know one thing: that I'm a superstar
These hoes get out of line, I'ma show 'em I'm a hog
And now that I'm rich, I show these hoes that they ain't shit
And every ho I fuck with, I make suck my dick
It ain't no secret, I know these hoes about my money, shit
But I tell a ho quick, that she ain't shit
My main ho Clare, I don't make her suck my dick
I might just get loose and wanna kiss my bitch
But now that I got a daughter, I'm supposed to be light on a bitch
But I'm gonna be hard on these hoes for life, shit
I'm a true U-P-T player for life, shit
But I'ma say it again, I don't love no bitches
I about my money, nigga, and fucking these bitches

Now I done been here for 25 years
I understand one thing: that life is a bitch
I done lost my ma and my pa, my brother and my sister all up in one year
I understand one thing, I gotta ball 'til I fall
And show these hoes that money ain't no thang, dawg
See, I tell a bitch that she ain't shit
And at the same time ask that ho to suck my dick
See, I don't take money and mix with no bitch
Cause one thing, these hoes would lose they mind and get lost quick
It ain't no secret, I make these hoes think I'll pay their shit
But I keep it real and I pay my nigga's shit
I say, "fuck a ho," and make these hoes back up
I keep it real and fuck with niggas who'll act up
And kick in your front door, your ho told my nigga where your dope
Now you stuck out like a ho!
And my niggas done hit a lick from your bitch
And all you hoes mad cause we done hit your shit

I got the game on ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain, I'm like a key in a drought
I spent a G on these frames, but my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas like a fuckin' psychic
Hearing through the grapevine, niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift, man, you better be Peyton
Boy, the heat's on, they makin' peace bonds
I'm in this bitch throwin' up the "17th" sign
Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times
That Tec-11, AK-47, one Beretta
Ready for whatever, tell them pussy niggas, "Come together"
Heavy better, nigga, super-soaker wet a nigga
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothin' but a petal, nigga
I'm just a little nigga tryin' to be a civil nigga
Thirty years old, shit, that'll be a given, nigga
Quit it, Wayne, your Mom is listenin'
But she ain't really trippin' 'cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas trippin' until the shots whistlin'
Hear them bullets hissin' like a cobra at attention
I got a bitch and quit callin' women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventin' the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live every day like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fuckin' good
Throw my dope like a rope, let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it, automatics in motion
We bangin' for the bread, nigga, even the molded
I got my loaf, I got my toast
Chaperone of the South, I got my coast
Yeah, and until I die
I'm the, the-the, the-the, the Best Rapper Alive</span></div></div>

Stand at the top like a tack in the roof
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes, not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking 'bout me, but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying, I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough 'til I knock off your kuf'
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me, I'm just tryna be Weezy

Been around the world, rep the same thing
Been around the world, it's the same gang
B's up, B's up, flame gang
Blaat, b-blaat, blaaa-blaaat, bang-bang
I told my homie Streets, "You can't sleep on life"
So he popped a X pill and didn't sleep all night
I ain't worrying 'bout you, I'm just trying do me
Last album did two, I'm just trying do three

Every girl that's guilty of waiting so long, sometime
So it seems like it doesn't make sense

[Female singing with laughing in the background]

[Sniffing]

[Verse]
Yeah, it was them cute pretty bitches that was smelling like coke
They kept going [egh egh] like they had shit in they throats
They had stacks on the tables, cables
I had to say it was like early May
A few days 'til my birthday date, baby date
I'll play to the sucker DJ, looking like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs-up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know we big spenders, gave us those mobster drinks
Sent us lobsters and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie-but-goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, your honey should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals, ladies far right from the stage
I'm 33, I look 26 with big furs on
What y'all inherit, the Santa Maria?
Y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say "fuck him"
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps, you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said "fuck you", took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone
Yo, you see I flip stones
Birthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned
3 rich pretty young ladies lost at 6, Gucci kicks
And they picky when it come to they dick
If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, eat well, hear bells
Before you sleep, read your books like it was my fanmail
And when you wake, you be a new woman, know the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an accountant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid
Computer wizard, you about to get paid
[Outro, over background singing]
Yea
You know I just met y'all
And I love y'all already and all that
But I gotta get off that nose candy
To make it in life and all that shit
That's why I'm here
I'm like a father figure and all that shit
I let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but
Ya'nawm sayin?
Cause I drop jewels all over the place
Y'all too pretty for that
Some of y'all nose hairs is burnt
I just want you to snap out of it
You know why? cause you's a</span></div></div>

[Intro: Raekwon &amp; Method Man]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though (Wu-Tang five finger shit, fam)
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
(Cash rules everything around me) Take you on a natural joint
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money)
(Dollar dollar bill, y'all) Here we, here we go, check this shit, yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now
[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could notâ€”
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
[Chorus: Method Man &amp; Inspectah Deck]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all (To get through, know what I'm sayin'?)
Cash rules everything around me (Because you can't just get by no more)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all (Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down)
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, yeah
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all-all-all, yeah</span></div></div>

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. &amp; Pop]
Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
[Chorus]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. &amp; Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
[Skit]
C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just gâ€” bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?
It's right over here
You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck, right here
Tsk, this better be this motherfucker's house
Oh shit
What? What's wrong?
What's that red dot on your head, man?
What red dot?
Oh shit! You got a red dot on your head, too
Oh shit!</span></div></div>

- Yo yo, what up baby boy?
- Ohhhhh

- What's the deal my nigga?
- Look at you, uh huh, you lookin like money
- You know what it is
- Yeah
- You know what it is
- Yeah
- It's been 2 or 3 years, right?

- You lookin' good though baby boy
- I mean whatever, lets get it poppin'
- Alright, well I'm with you, gimmie your number
- No doubt, no doubt
- Here go my number right here
[Verse 1]
You know the happenings, homies just yappin' and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchangin' all they math again
You usually lose touch when you travelin'
A few dudes bruised up in the battlin'
Parked on Madison across from the Radisson
We talked about the tattlin' some niggas did in Maryland
Plus discussed old homicides unravelin'
I asked, was he dabblin', he laughed and said he managin'
His Carti frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Oprah's mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird, 'fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, "Homie, hold it down"

[Hook]
You know the game insane in the brain
Big things in the Range, real niggas never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So through the fame, through the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggas do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
[Verse 2]
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be doggin' for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin'
Up in Nordstrom's for a fresh pair to floss 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em before the salesmen even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em before any celeb stylist ever saw 'em
Wore 'em soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rockin', I answered, what's poppin'
They answered and said, they shot him, now the hood got a problem
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old clique I just seen and spoke with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's Doe or Die, we survive 'till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was probably high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camouflage on any terrain
Carti frames, we go back like Bartles and James
It's a shame cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain
If they just wanted some news they could've left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged
[Hook]

Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote
"Okay, Iâ€™m reloaded," better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I donâ€™t even need light
Iâ€™m with a model broad, she donâ€™t even eat rice, ha
But, would you believe it? She eat dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes, yeah

And youâ€™re the best at never doing shit

Tr-try me and Iâ€™ll have your people reading eulogies, haha
I swear, you canâ€™t fuck with me

I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth
[Chorus: Lil' Kim &amp; Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no
All I wanna do is get my pussy sucked (Nigga!)
Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y
The BX, the chron-chron and the list goes on and on
(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': "Yeah baby, I love you long time"
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face
[Chorus: Lil' Kim &amp; Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

[Verse 3]
I'ma keep it real, for the dough I might kill
I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said "Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye"
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: "Fool, Give me my money!"
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none
[Chorus: Lil' Kim &amp; Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick</span></div></div>

Say dawg, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
"Good night friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again"
Uh, I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could, they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease
This guy's in a hurry
Ma, I can't even fuck with you if you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying their jewelry
Why's your ice cream, like it's made by Ben &amp; Jerry?
Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
E-mail snitch got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons, to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po', recovering slow
The government know, the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow
Ghetto

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I keep the streets so numb they call me "Novocaine"
I turn over 'caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures: down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, Pusha-Ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Mine's mental, others is made up stencil
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livid, they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Yves St. Laurent knitted, shorts bermuda
You would think they was Pucci if you overlooked Medusa</span></div></div>

I'm a hustla, I'm a I'm a hustla homie
'97 had a brick by the muffler crony
Wholesale to my select preferred customers only
The white horse cooked tan you can call it the pony
It's only the soft it twists like a wrestler on me
It hardens, it cools I prove I'm a juggler whoadie
Glock popped got it cheap I'mma smother you
Hovered and govern the corner you hugged then I shuffle you roadie
Face it they change, the game's never loving you sorry
You live for the moment it's gone then they cover you homie
Back against the wall, post up never fall
Never fail, keep a burner close you can fend them off
Get that 10 up off the car and you let it off
Sort of like Avon and Marlo when you set it off
[Bet it all!] Nigga it's war till the metal's off
[Dead 'em all!] Nigga we ride till the pedal's off

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Vicious with the verse Iâ€™m as genius as Ray
You niggas seeing nothing on the Zenith like Rae
Black hand white keys ya'll seen this Iâ€™m Ray
Got more white in the hood than the KKK
The grand wizard of that almighty blizzard
My numbers come scissored, I be where they breeding lizards
Now nigga go figure I ainâ€™t been out in two
Switched jewels twice the upgrade was more blue
Now if you got a question nigga save that for Clue
But if you know the answer than you probably copped from dude
Flewish blueish the hues is the newest, the sickest shit the chain is so gratuitous
Break it shake it bake it then you cools it, treat it like them whiteys at Nike and just do it
Hot as me? Fuck no, they mockeries
Flows get quoted like Socratesâ€™ philosophies
[Hook]
R-E-U-P G-A-N-G
R-E-U-P G-A-N-G

[Verse 3: Sandman]
While everybody snitching my niggas play their position
Either you hugged the block or cooked in the kitchen
Or you was a master, good with your fingers
Trying to bag a slab up while that's still wet
Cause the fiends is hovering, smothering fussing and they frustrated with headaches
The rock be their bufferin
'94 till now the block still jumping and
Proper raw was found when niggas had nothing in
I used to scuffle them, 22 illusions
Color top stop don't confuse them
Other blocks hot cause they're losing
Hot cause of shootings
Niggas getting rocked like powder, that's power
I'm in and out of there though
Your hood bitch look good de Janeiro
Rio even she know, kilos I throw at least 3 like cee-lo every time

[Verse 4: Malice]
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Conspiracy theory or life behind bars
When faced with the time they telling it all
Thatâ€™s the risk that you take playing neighborhood czar
Not just your name, your race is betrayed
Youâ€™re the bottom of the food chain, I spit on your grave
Youâ€™re the modern day African capturing slaves
How you live with yourself yet canâ€™t escape your face
I put it in the street and they canâ€™t escape the taste
It just keep calling the white when it harden
Iâ€™m so at home with it like the Knicks in the Garden
And I canâ€™t say that it donâ€™t beat starving
Any given time Malice with the arsenal
Yaâ€™ll be wearing rosary beads like the cardinal
Of the roman catholic man the boyâ€™s classic reading two hundred for the speed where the dash is</span></div></div>

All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise
A fistful of dollars, a list full of problems
I address 'em like P.O. boxes
Yeah, I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit
We so out of it, zero tolerance
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fuckin' with that block shit
Wet your ass up head to feet 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter, tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money, honeypie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screamin', "Fuck the other side"
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds, I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya after I erase ya?
Look around
We at war and you still in preparation
I'm ridin' for them reparations, no patience
Slow paper is better than no paper
Fast money don't last too long, you got to pace it
You gotta know that paper
If you got it from a caper, gotta blow that paper
Gotta know that
Photophobia, no Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em, naw
I ain't even in the school yearbook
I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look, ah
Career crook, get your career took
I'm back like a brassiere hook
Bitch, cheer
Camouflage gear, the hunter's here
Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here, and this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce, I want the whole enchilada
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em
On they head at the bottom
You ain't got to shoot 'em 'cause I already shot 'em
And I ain't got to get 'em 'cause I already got 'em
Get 'em</span></div></div>

Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

[Hook]
You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

[Verse 1]
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital â€” Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing
[Hook]
And you know that Iâ€™ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Donâ€™t worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
â€˜Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that Iâ€™m gon' be in it
The sky is the limit (Errrrrrrr!)

[Verse 2]
Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, "Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "Talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art â€” unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40-cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
[Hook]
And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

[Verse 3]
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa â€” that's fucked up, haha
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha, now that's fucked up
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets
[Hook]
So you know that I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit</span></div></div>

[Intro]
Killa! (Killa!), Dipset, man
Ayo you know I've been all over the motherfucking world, man
But ain't no place like Harlem, man
Let me break it down, man

[Verse 1]
We tie dynamite to the rhino type, wino might find yo' sight
Sell the information for a dime of white, that China-China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner
Elder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya
My mind designer. You a dime? I'll dine ya
Madonna momma, body bottled, you're fine. I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then I hymen-grind her 'til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm
Turn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw
"Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along"
Said "how?" "don't trip," but, yo, the trick is wrong
First visi-on, day job tick-a-tron
Nighttime, Mr. Mom, bootleg Cris' and Dom
Brother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm
They sell yay', you'll say "yay, this shit's the bomb"
I'ma hit my man, tell 'em you my pick upon
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know, kiss his mom, she gave him wisdom charm
And their father come from a long list of dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said "be careful"
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world (Killa!)

[Verse 2]
Everybody like, "Cam got the recipe now!"
Not them 3 girls, I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)
Specially equities, reckon we smile
Interfere, tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive, receptive of fouls
Hectic, Heckler &amp; Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals (what else?)
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy
Go to the gun show, get gun-happy (who are we?)
Stuck, killed, mugged, milled
Tone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk (what up, y'all)
Pucci baba, but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga (nigga)
Ya, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains
See dog? Rap is my aim
But I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game
Attached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be asking for Dame, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
And anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road, holding you up, you cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances one-on-one with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world (Killa!)</span></div></div>

Doctor C

[Verse 1]
Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon-14's
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain
With gamma X-rays 'til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedars-Sinai room
So I can get sick as the flu, spittin' the truth
If you ain't got this album, you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose
Give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris, Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker, my great grandfather was Irish
Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man
Put a thousand on me, put one on him
I tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo, I soak that sugar-coated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off
Call Detroit's Mafia Boss
Tell him, "Yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls"
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up
Yo, you wonder where I am right now?
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C, Ph. D, graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you can't see
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CD's
In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies
If you don't like the quality, then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep?
Punching the keys, remember that sound
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me, I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man, double the beef
To tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, et cetera et cetera
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
Nigga look, this is all I got to say
Suck my P-H-D-I-C-K</span></div></div>

It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
What people pay paper for, damn it
They can't stand it, they want something new
So let's get reacquainted, became the hood favorite
I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Refrain: Kanye West]
We outta here, baby! We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dude! Fresh off the planeâ€”Konnichiwa, bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it, I did itâ€”that asshole done did it
Talked it, then he lived it, spit it, then he shit it
I don't need writÄ“rs, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?
They say, "He goin' crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top five MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top five MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big, you can't sit behind me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

Yeah, yeah, we outta here, baby!
What? What? We outta here, baby!
Ayy, Mr. West, we so outta here, baby!
And me? I'm Mr. Weezy Baby, yeah!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm so bright, not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fuckin' good like I'm sleepin' with Meagan (Ha!)
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns, and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them"â€”I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy, you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hayvocâ€”oops, I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still col' like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties (Bow!)
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid (No homo)
And I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice, and I don't lack shit
And you can get buriedâ€”suck my bat, bitch (ha!)

We outta here, baby!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Eagle, Eagle Carter man
In a '96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Got to wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I got to do something I done blown my last
Dollar holler at your boy on the ave
And that cheap perico is what I'm known to have
Shit tend to be slow I put on the mask
And make it Halloween and take all your bags
I say Holly-hollygrove won't you go and stand up
And make these motherfuckers understand
I say, "Look coach they pitching at me under hand"
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got that jet black four at ya mami's spot
I'm trying to get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now, you better pan it down
'Fore the neighbors they overhear me tear it down
Yeah it's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, the prince

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And the handgun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya ho I don't want your contusions
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I am going to keep proving
It's Weezy F, I got ya momma groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boys she say I'm the coolest
I bought my bag of oranges its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it
I floss, a awful lot of haters try and reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid
One shot to remind you who is
That fly little nigga that's behind the trigger, Wizzle
I'm off chronic combined with liquor
But niggas'll never see me like Momma Tigger
A 80's-baby a fighting nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm something you call pepper like a Viking slick
See me over the viking stove I'm whitening bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out untightening clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting a spliff
I do this you catching my drift
Representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince
[Chorus: Reel]
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
So roll the carpet out
'Cause you fucking with a nigga from the royal South
See you either in or you out and if you out stay in 'cause them warriors out
Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
No nigga I never call your house I'm probably somewhere taking Toya out
Not answering my phone, man, ignoring ya spouse
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out
I got graveyard fliers man I'm passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the prince</span></div></div>

[Verse]
I hear the rumors, but niggas won't say they said it
They know Duke got a shooter like JJ Redick
You'd think niggas was G4s the way they jetted
'Cause when they AK's wet it, then your Pelle shredded
They sick, I got the chick that some say they sweated
But cryin' over chicks is the shit that got AJ deaded
Plus, I wipe my ass wit the pay they netted
Couple scams, couple grams, that's the way they get it
But me, wasn't for rap I'm probably down South
With the coke that give the fiends the Bobby Brown mouth
Strung like Whitney, I brung like 50
It's toxic, shit'll have em' sprung like Britney
Now nigga, you think I'm lettin' a young'n get me?
Without gettin' chest shots losin' a lung an' kidney?
I'm trey pound revolvin', butterfly carvin'
Starvin' to get my jab Antonio Tarvin
Anyone botherin' anything I'm involved in
It's Gs on they head like the helmet Brett Favre in
Got a girl I put the X on like she Malcolm
The outcome, she get to suckin' like she a vacuum
But when it wear off, she could pull a Pam Grier off
Give her a couple hours she'll knock the whole sway off
Them niggas got fired, I just took a year off
I really just was tired of niggas talkin' my ear off
I heard it all before like Sunshine Anderson
The flow'll have niggas that's unsigned panickin'
I might turn ya' back to a punchline fan again
It's crazy how many niggas that one line can offend
(Yo they think you talkin 'bout 'em Fab)
But I don't give a flyin' fuck
Bet I got that iron tucked when I'm in that Cayenne truck
I'm like crappin' out when it come to tryin' luck
I like ya ace to the dukes when you placed in the booth
Another bishop, who wanna taste of the juice?
But you gonna end up fallin' on ya face from the roof
I'm waitin' to get the call that Mase on the loose
Next time you see 'em, he'll have his face in a noose
I'm in the club snub on the waist by the boost
Just a taste of the juice just ta' chase wit' the goose
I need a mami who want her face introduced
To the man behind the zipper, and then I flip her
You could ask the strippers, I'm a very good tipper
I'm paid like a playa but move just like a skipper
I gettin' older, growin' wiser
I been shinin' since 3 fingers and high-risers
I tell the model chicks meet a nigga at the Plaza
And then I beat it up somethin' like a womanizer
Without a doubt they walkin' out like Kaiser
And you can try me when I'm comin' out but I advise ya mothafucka
[Hook]
They wan' do whatever I wan' do

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, manâ€”I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?
[Hook: Santigold &amp; (Jay-Z)]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head
[Hook: Santigold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

[Outro: Santigold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard</span></div></div>

("Fuck all you hoes!" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in BambÃº, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total &amp; Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The MoÃ«t and AlizÃ© keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total &amp; Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. &amp; Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Post-Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. &amp; Puff Daddy]
Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

[Chorus: Total]
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

[Outro: Puff Daddy &amp; Total]
Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
It's all good
Who you are
Yeah
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars

[Intro]
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye... (Good riddance!)
Hold up...

[Chorus]
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ringtone
This ainâ€™t for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct (uhh!)
This might offend my political connects (uhh!)
My raps donâ€™t have melodies
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (Uhh!)
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)
All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
[Chorus]
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...

[Verse 2]
This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ainâ€™t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 (uhh!)
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled, for we the bestin... (uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
[Chorus]
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...

[Verse 3]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy... Ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it (uhh!)
Get 3 Thou' to style on this
I just donâ€™t need nobody to smile on this (uhh!)
You niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much (uhh, uhh!)
Iâ€™m a multi-millionaire
So how is it Iâ€™m still the hardest nigga here (uhh!)
I donâ€™t be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the projects all day (uhh!)
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
[Outro]
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...</span></div></div>
