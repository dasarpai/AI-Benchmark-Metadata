Viewed this way, ADHD is a very serious disorder as it disrupts a major psychological adaptation that humans use to survive, prosper, and see to their longer-term welfare.  When you tell people that, they understand how serious this is and that a cup of Starbuck, a better nights sleep, less screen time with technology, or some nutritional supplement will not address this fundamental problem.

While certain brain regions and gray matter or somewhat smaller during development, this may not be so much the case by adulthood.  Nonetheless, we continue to see evidence of reduced connectivity of some regions with others that are part of these executive networks, of excess connectivity with non-executive regions, and especially with more variable functioning in these connections or networks that give rise to the ADHD symptoms and related executive function (EF) networks.  So in short its a problem with connectivity and functioning of networks critical for self-regulation and EF, such a inhibition, self-awareness, time management, working memory, emotional self-regulation and motivation, and planning and problem solving.  It helps to understand what is happening in ADHD by over simplifying brain activity as being where knowledge is acquired (back part of the brain) and where that knowledge is activated and applied in daily performance (frontal executive brain).  ADHD partially disconnects the typical interaction of these brain regions, in a sense.  So ADHD is far more a problem of doing what you know, not knowing what to do.  Its a performance problem, not a knowledge problem.  Adults with ADHD are not ignorant, but they struggle to apply all of what they know in key situations where such knowledge should have guided their actions and decision making, and it didn't.&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Hi Dr. Barkley, thanks for doing this.  \n\n\nWhat is your elevator pitch for what is going on in the brain due to ADHD?\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have any tips for someone figuring out which medication regimen works?\n Ans: In my opinion, ADHD arises from problems with brain maldevelopment especially in the prefrontal executive networks that can arise either from genetic factors (different gene variants and mutations for building and regulating such networks) or from acquired disruptions to the development of these networks and regions.

For example, would a kid with adhd already have anxiety or ocd along with it, or would the anxiety develop over time because of the adhd?&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I think the answer to this is above - ADHD is really SRDD (EFDD).  Social interactions, reciprocity, cooperation, and even intimacy all require appropriate degrees of self-regulation from an individual.  When such self-regulation is jeopardized by the disorder, it greatly impacts social acceptance and functioning because it raises problems with making and keeping promises, reciprocating with others (sharing), joining into cooperative team or group activities to accomplish some common goal, repaying favors, managing debts, accomplishing daily social responsibilities -- all are at risk from the disorder.  Others can detect these differences in adults with ADHD within minutes of getting to know them.  Of all the EF difficulties, it is the impulsive emotional and poor self regulation of emotion that is so harmful to social relationships.  Others can tolerate one's distractibility, activity, fizzy personality so to speak, but not someone's quickness to be impatient, frustrated, hostile, angry or even reactively verbally and physically aggressive.  That can easily lead to social rejection, being fired from your job,  road rage and related citations and license suspensions, intimate partner distress and even violence, etc. So it is the dysregulated emotion more than other symptoms that takes its toll on social relations when ADHD is unmanaged.&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Hello Dr. Barkley, thank you so much for doing this \n\nWhy is it that many people with adhd feel like they don't fit in with their peers, or just society as a whole? \n\nAlso, are comorbidities more of a nature or nurture type issue? For example, would a kid with adhd already have anxiety or ocd along with it, or would the anxiety develop over time because of the adhd?\n Ans: I think the answer to this is above - ADHD is really SRDD (EFDD).  Social interactions, reciprocity, cooperation, and even intimacy all require appropriate degrees of self-regulation from an individual.  When such self-regulation is jeopardized by the disorder, it greatly impacts social acceptance and functioning because it raises problems with making and keeping promises, reciprocating with others (sharing), joining into cooperative team or group activities to accomplish some common goal, repaying favors, managing debts, accomplishing daily social responsibilities -- all are at risk from the disorder.  Others can detect these differences in adults with ADHD within minutes of getting to know them.

Present research, which is incredibly abundant, shows that variation in humans in their ADHD symptoms is about 70-80% influenced by genetic variation (differences in genes that build and operate the brain).  The remainder is the result of non shared environmental factors, which are things that impacted just that person in their family.  This would include pregnancy complications, maternal infections, material use of alcohol when pregnant, premature delivery warranting the infant to go to an NICU, etc.  After birth, things like lead poisoning, traumatic brain injuries, and any other factor that adversely impacts brain development in the EF prefrontal brain can lead to ADHD.  So its pretty much all biology (neurology and genetics).  Rearing environment has not been found to be a contributor to ADHD.  That said, people with ADHD are more likely to experience traumatic events, including physical, sexual, and emotional trauma, as a consequence of their lack of foresight, risk taking, and other behaviors as well as the peers they select to associated with.  Such things can also arise within families not only from the behavioral difficulties and challenges posed by such children to caregivers, but also by the fact that 25-35% or more of parents have ADHD which can interfere with their own parenting and increase the  likelihood for such traumas and victimization.  Its possible that some kinds of trauma feedback to worsen the ADHD symptoms (traumatic brain injuries for instance) but less clear that emotional trauma can do this.  Regardless, because of their problems with emotional self-regulation, people with ADHD are more prone to develop PTSD if traumatized and find it more difficult to treat such PTSD.

I got into this field in 1972 when I attended UNC and was majoring in psychology and minoring in biology.  I wanted to go to graduate school but need to have done extra things besides getting good grades.  So I wandered their medical school offering to volunteer 15+ hours per week to anyone who needed a research assistant.  By chance, a faculty member had just gotten a grant to study hyperactive (ADHD) children and the role of behavior modification and medication in treating them.  I became his assistant, then his honors student, and went on to graduate school where I did all my research on ADHD and  have never stopped since.  The condition fascinated me as I wanted to understand why these children had such poor behavioral (self) control.  As I got older, I also realized that understanding ADHD could teach us a great deal about how people generally develop self regulation, what it is, how the executive functions develop so as to allow self control.  And I wrote two books just on my theory of all that (ADHD and the Nature of Self Control, 1997, and The Executive Functions, in 2012).  Studying ADHD is like holding a mirror up to ourselves - we can all learn a lot from it about self regulation and how to improve it.  As some of you know, ADHD was also in my family and so studying it helped me personally to understand and even deal with and try eo help some family members my fraternal twin brother in particular.  Regrettably, his life of impulsivity, risk taking, risky driving, and use of alcohol resulted in his death in a car accident when he was 56.

Is the individual experiencing personal suffering, functional ineffectiveness, and/or adverse consequences from displaying those symptoms.  Symptoms alone do not make a disorder.

So driving, substance use and abuse, impaired social relationships, managing money, risk taking, etc. are all ways to see if ADHD is there in high IQ people apart from just school and work, as you noted above.  So we can usually find impairment but it other domains than work and education.  The critical criterion for establishing that any disorder is present is one of harm.  Is the individual experiencing personal suffering, functional ineffectiveness, and/or adverse consequences from displaying those symptoms.  Symptoms alone do not make a disorder.  But should they be frequent and serious enough to lead to harmful consequences (impairment) then that is where a disorder gets diagnosed.  No impairment, then no disorder.  But impairment can arise in many domains than just school or work.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[deleted]&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Lots of related and good questions here.  And your concerns are very typical of the adults with ADHD we have studied in our clinical research and seen in the centers i used to manage.  First, the EF and self-regulation deficits inherent in ADHD make work as much a struggle as they did school, especially if the work is not intrinsically rewarding, and most of work isn't.  Second, ADHD delays the typical diurnal rhythm of the brain such that adults with ADHD usually report being more alert and attentive in afternoons and at night than in the morning.  Indeed, research shows that the clock gene is different in people with ADHD.  All this means that if you have a  typical day job, it is to some extent conflicting with your own natural diurnal cycle of alertness.  Some adults seek out more flexible work hours, second shifts, or even self-employment to allow them to work when they are most suitable to do so instead of just on the typical work day schedule.  As for jobs, Google ADHD Success Stories and you will see the sorts of nontraditional occupations that adults with ADHD have found better suited to their ADHD.  Also, my new book has an entire section on this issue.  And the new documentary, The Disruptors, is all about this pursuit of nontraditional routes to work and success with lots of cameos by adults with ADHD who succeeded.  See if you can find it on Amazon Prime, Netflix, PBS, etc.  Not sure who picked it up as it was just released this spring.  Its not hopeless but often adults we have known really had to go outside the box of traditional routes of occupations instead of business, medicine, law, desk jobs, etc.  They seemed to do better in the trades, as entrepreneurs, in performing arts as noted above, in athletics or teaching physical ed, in home building or destruction (Ty Pennington anyone?), in the culinary arts, as EMTs or in police or fire work, in the military, etc.  Notice they all involve movement, working at unusual hours and times, allow for inattention, focus on manual activities rather than extended forethought and planning, frequent social interactions with others (sales), etc.  Keep at it.

So that is not so much a processing problem as a gating and inhibition problem with competing sensory events not relevant to goals still crash into goal directed thinking.

Yes there is a connection both in underlying shared genetics and in causation over time.  The risk genes for ADHD are shared with those for anxiety to some extent but not completely.

We aer not sure why but experiencing repeated failure could easily lead to the acquisition of various anxiety disorders, in my opinion.  If the anxiety remains rlatively low and related to failure, then ADHD medications have been shown to improve it.

And, yes, they would be different in their neuroanatomy as injuries produce more detectable damage int he brain than would a genetically caused malformation of brain circuitry.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it common for many people with ADHD to suffer extreme work burnout?

I hope that more items of impulsivity (cognitive, motivational, emotional) get into the next one and fewer symptoms of hyperactivity and a few others added to cover EF better so that the criteria are more sensitive to the adult stage of ADHD than they are now, based entirely on children as they originally were in earlier DSMs.  But the decisions made by the  APA are also political, not just scientifically based, so its hard to know where this will go.  I just think that more emphasis on EF and self-regulation would vastly improve the DSM.  And waiving the age of onset of age 12 as its not valid or reliable.  Onset is usually during development up to age 18-24 but can arise de novo after an injury to the brain that affects the EF networks.  So the age of onset is a problem that needs fixing.  I teach clinicians to ignore it and also use 4 symptoms endorsed on either list as the threshold to diagnose as its more science based.

Just free associate to the content but be sure to write it down or that idea will be lost to you later.  Then sit down and type all your notes into a Word file.  Don't worry about sentence structure or even sequence just get the content in there.  Now that it is out of your head and physically represented on in the computer on the screen, you can manipulate it, expand, contract, edit, etc. all outside your head and not lose the pieces.  Just keep expanding first, then polishing it later all on the screen and it may help.

Then as you go about your day jot down any other freely associated ideas that spring to mind on that topic but don't force it.  Just capture the as they fly through your mind.  When you have enough ideas, take the cards or scraps and try to sequence them into some kind of order.  You can do this manually or type them into a Word file as above.

Your work is greatly appreciated in the ADHD community. Thank you for everything you do.  \n  \nI'd like to ask: what study, on people with ADHD, yielded the most fascinating or surprising results to you?&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you study something for 49 years as I have since 1973, you will be surprised more than once.  So I will give you two that stand out understanding there were others as well.  First, that ADHD greatly disrupts the  human sense of time and especially the ability to be governed by ones sense of time passing (time management).  I came upon the idea to test it by reading an essay on how animal and human minds and language/communication may differ.  From it I learned that disinhibition is related to sense of time.  So I tested it first in ADHD in children, then later in teens, adults, and my 25 year follow up study.  People at any age with ADHD were very impaired in time management and time sense.  No one had ever said that or predicted it until then.  And it was not a subtle but a massive deficit, especially when we measured it through ratings of time sense and time management, not just lab measures.  I was blown away.  Now its a rock solid finding in the ADHD literature and led me to coin the term time blind or future myopia for the condition.\n\nThe second one came in late 2018-2019.  I have always suspected that ADHD adversely affects health, and we knew it caused more accidental injuries and even early mortality from them.  But in my longitudinal study in Milwaukee we were documenting all kinds of health and medical issues as the kids became adults, from obesity, poor nutrition, impaired sleep, increased smoking, excess alcohol use, poor driving, lousy cholesterol panels, etc.  But in that year I found a way to combine all that information into a calculator that can estimate life expectancy based on 14 human factors.  No one had studied that before.  But we had all 14 of those factors in my study.  The results from the calculations were stunning and sobering.  I had to run them a second time and check all the data entry to make sure we made no mistakes.  We had not.  A diagnosis of ADHD in childhood was associated with a 9-10 year reduction in life expectancy and if the condition persisted to age 27 the reduction was 12-13 years.  That is huge!  Greater than any major health variable we try to change in people these days so they live longer.  Why, because  ADHD is predisposing to many such adverse lifestyle and health factors that all add up to a considerable reduction in lifespan if not treated.  So that was my second surprise.

As a teacher, I think this the most useful insight into working with students with ADHD. I'd like to be able to explain it well when I'm talking with colleagues and parents. Can you explain some of the specifics of the research that led to this number? \nThank you so much for doing this AMA!&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The 30% rule about which I often speak is merely a rough clinically derived approximation for how far behind a typical child with ADHD may be from their more typical peers in their development of self-regulation (SR)(executive functioning, or EF).  I developed the concept while writing the first edition of my book for parents (Taking Charge of ADHD) but also while practicing clinically at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center from 1985-2002.  I was searching for a means by which to counsel parents and teachers on the extent to which such children were behind others of their age so as to get adults to understand the concept of a delay and the need to adjust one’s expectations down to a more appropriate level for a child so delayed.  Even back then, ADHD was considered to be developmental in nature and best considered as a delay in development, not a loss of previously normal functioning as in someone with an injury.  That idea was borrowed from two other neurodevelopmental disorders - intellectual disability and learning disorders.  For both, we often speak about the functional developmental level of the child in the domain of their delay, in those cases intelligence and learning (reading, math, spelling, language etc.) specifically.  Indeed, in the field of intelligence research, the concept of a mental age rather than an IQ was used for years in clinical work with families of such children.  \nThe rule is not based on a single scientific study of that issue, which would be far too time consuming and expensive to conduct.  Instead, I was searching for a clinical rule or concept, not one of exact scientific specification as derived from a single such study.  So I went back into my own published research studies and that of many others and simply wrote down the extent to which the ADHD group's performance differed from that of typical children in the same study and looked at a wide range of children’s ages.  I did this for a wide variety of measures of EF, child social behaviors, and others.  The range of deficits was from about 25-41% or so.  The average was 32% but that is not as good for clinical use as is using a nice round number when speaking to parents.  So I rounded it down to 30%.  On average, then, a child with ADHD seems to perform about 30% behind others of their age in their EF and self-regulation.  Don't let the exact number distract you from the point of this exercise.  It is clearly a rough (imprecise) rule based on a back of the envelop type of calculation. But it worked brilliantly in advising families and others about how to understand the concept of a delay in EF, or one’s functional executive age, and start thinking about where their own child might be in that level of delay.  The point of the rule is for families to understand not just the concept of a delay but, more important to its purpose, also about the need to lower expectations to better fit with their child’s delayed level of EF/SR.    \nSo there is no single scientific paper of mine to send you.  And the number itself is a crude approximation.  Instead, one views the 30% rule as an imprecise estimate so as to better convey a concept of delayed EF/SR to families and teachers and, most importantly, the need to match expectations to functional levels of EF/SR performance.  \nI am so glad to know that my work has been of value to you in understanding ADHD and its management.&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Hi Dr Barkley! \nIn one of your lectures, you described ADHD adolescents as being about 30% behind their age-level peers in terms of emotional maturation.

I was searching for a means by which to counsel parents and teachers on the extent to which such children were behind others of their age so as to get adults to understand the concept of a delay and the need to adjust one’s expectations down to a more appropriate level for a child so delayed.  Even back then, ADHD was considered to be developmental in nature and best considered as a delay in development, not a loss of previously normal functioning as in someone with an injury.  That idea was borrowed from two other neurodevelopmental disorders - intellectual disability and learning disorders.  For both, we often speak about the functional developmental level of the child in the domain of their delay, in those cases intelligence and learning (reading, math, spelling, language etc.) specifically.  Indeed, in the field of intelligence research, the concept of a mental age rather than an IQ was used for years in clinical work with families of such children.  \nThe rule is not based on a single scientific study of that issue, which would be far too time consuming and expensive to conduct.  Instead, I was searching for a clinical rule or concept, not one of exact scientific specification as derived from a single such study.  So I went back into my own published research studies and that of many others and simply wrote down the extent to which the ADHD group's performance differed from that of typical children in the same study and looked at a wide range of children’s ages.  I did this for a wide variety of measures of EF, child social behaviors, and others.  The range of deficits was from about 25-41% or so.  The average was 32% but that is not as good for clinical use as is using a nice round number when speaking to parents.  So I rounded it down to 30%.  On average, then, a child with ADHD seems to perform about 30% behind others of their age in their EF and self-regulation.  Don't let the exact number distract you from the point of this exercise.  It is clearly a rough (imprecise) rule based on a back of the envelop type of calculation. But it worked brilliantly in advising families and others about how to understand the concept of a delay in EF, or one’s functional executive age, and start thinking about where their own child might be in that level of delay.  The point of the rule is for families to understand not just the concept of a delay but, more important to its purpose, also about the need to lower expectations to better fit with their child’s delayed level of EF/SR.    \nSo there is no single scientific paper of mine to send you.  And the number itself is a crude approximation.  Instead, one views the 30% rule as an imprecise estimate so as to better convey a concept of delayed EF/SR to families and teachers and, most importantly, the need to match expectations to functional levels of EF/SR performance.  \nI am so glad to know that my work has been of value to you in understanding ADHD and its management.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm very interested in your theory about the potential second attention disorder, Sluggish Cognitive Tempo/Concentration Deficit Disorder.

While nearly all psychiatric disorder adversely affect attention in some form, only ADHD is a disorder of attention to the future, the next, or the later and involves disrupted goal directed attention.  Other disorders are more likely to create an SCT pattern of inattention in which the mind decouples from the external environment and overly engages in attention to mental content, as in mind wandering, rumination, daydreaming, rexperiencing as in PTSD.

Do you have any advice on how to explain ADHD, more specifically late diagnosis (40’s) to friends and family?  So many people seem to just think it’s about being distracted or hyperactive without acknowledging all the other symptoms/traits that come along with it.  

After my diagnosis last fall and reading a lot of books (including some of yours!), etc, I’ve realized a lot of my failures and faults were adhd caused (and I’m now addressing)..  I can’t expect them to all read like I have though.

 Ans: I like to explain to others that ADHD is far more than merely a disorder of attention or activity; it is a disorder of self-regulation and of the major executive brain functions that permit us to self-regulate.  As we develop, self-regulation becomes increasingly critical to our well being and becoming independent of our families and self-governing in society.  Thus, ADHD is disrupting one of the most essential psychological capacities, which is that of self-control.  We use self-regulation to organize our actions over time in anticipation of and preparation for future events, goals, assigned tasks, etc.  It is, simply put, attention to the future and that is what people with ADHD struggle to attend to.  They attend just fine to the now and external environment.  But they struggle to attend to the next; to the impending future and what must be done to prepare for its arrival.  Viewed this way, ADHD is a very serious disorder as it disrupts a major psychological adaptation that humans use to survive, prosper, and see to their longer-term welfare.  When you tell people that, they understand how serious this is and that a cup of Starbuck, a better nights sleep, less screen time with technology, or some nutritional supplement will not address this fundamental problem.

I got into this field in 1972 when I attended UNC and was majoring in psychology and minoring in biology.  I wanted to go to graduate school but need to have done extra things besides getting good grades.  So I wandered their medical school offering to volunteer 15+ hours per week to anyone who needed a research assistant.  By chance, a faculty member had just gotten a grant to study hyperactive (ADHD) children and the role of behavior modification and medication in treating them.  I became his assistant, then his honors student, and went on to graduate school where I did all my research on ADHD and  have never stopped since.  The condition fascinated me as I wanted to understand why these children had such poor behavioral (self) control.  As I got older, I also realized that understanding ADHD could teach us a great deal about how people generally develop self regulation, what it is, how the executive functions develop so as to allow self control.  And I wrote two books just on my theory of all that (ADHD and the Nature of Self Control, 1997, and The Executive Functions, in 2012).  Studying ADHD is like holding a mirror up to ourselves - we can all learn a lot from it about self regulation and how to improve it.  As some of you know, ADHD was also in my family and so studying it helped me personally to understand and even deal with and try eo help some family members my fraternal twin brother in particular.

Like many other adults during quarantine, I was diagnosed at 42. I am still absolutely astonished that it was missed during grade school and absolutely appalled at the hurdles that we have to jump to get treatment. 

I see new posts daily about someone being told “adults can’t have ADHD” “you can read, you don’t have it” “you got good grades, it’s not affecting you”. I don’t know how some of these people are still allowed to practice.

For instance, people with ASD often have sensory perceptual problems as you know related to lighting, clothes and their texture, touch, loud noise, etc.  This often occurs at very early stages of processing.  That is not so typical of ADHD unless it coexists with ASD. Instead, in ADHD, the problem is one of inhibition and gating at higher levels of cognitive activity in which competing forms of sensations distract or disrupt thinking and goal directed actions.  So that is not so much a processing problem as a gating and inhibition problem with competing sensory events not relevant to goals still crash into goal directed thinking.

 Ans: Problems with sensory processing can occur at various levels of brain processing of information and can be found in several disorders.  For instance, people with ASD often have sensory perceptual problems as you know related to lighting, clothes and their texture, touch, loud noise, etc.  This often occurs at very early stages of processing.  That is not so typical of ADHD unless it coexists with ASD. Instead, in ADHD, the problem is one of inhibition and gating at higher levels of cognitive activity in which competing forms of sensations distract or disrupt thinking and goal directed actions.  So that is not so much a processing problem as a gating and inhibition problem with competing sensory events not relevant to goals still crash into goal directed thinking.  NTs would have inhibited such competing information effortlessly but the ADHD brain and its weaker inhibitory systems may not do so as easily, at least by my line of reasoning.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Glad to.  Yes there is a connection both in underlying shared genetics and in causation over time.  The risk genes for ADHD are shared with those for anxiety to some extent but not completely.  About 20-25% of children with ADHD have one or more anxiety disorders.  That figure nearly doubles by adulthood (about age 35-45) to 45-50% if the ADHD goes untreated in adulthood.  Even over a typical 4 year period in adulthood, research shows that ADHD at time 1 is linked to increased risk for an anxiety disorder at time 2, even controlling for level of any anxiety at time 1.  We aer not sure why but experiencing repeated failure could easily lead to the acquisition of various anxiety disorders, in my opinion.  If the anxiety remains rlatively low and related to failure, then ADHD medications have been shown to improve it.  If it is greater and related to excess fearfulness, panic, worry over the future, etc. as occurs in anxiety disorders even without ADHD, then adding some anti-anxiety medication along with cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety among other psychological methods would likely be suggested to that person by an informed clinician.</span></div></div>

Is there any observable difference between a brain that has ADHD "naturally" versus one that "develops" it? That is, if someone receives an injury to the frontal lobe, can changes in behavior be differentiated from someone who has had it their entire life? Is there any difference on a mechanical, chemical, or other such level?

I ask because my father had a traumatic brain injury and I suspect my mother is part of the genetic link to my ADHD. Both of my parents had traumatic childhoods, but I don't believe my mother has ever been diagnosed with an injury. I was born after my dad's injury, so I didn't observe the changes others had.

I hope that more items of impulsivity (cognitive, motivational, emotional) get into the next one and fewer symptoms of hyperactivity and a few others added to cover EF better so that the criteria are more sensitive to the adult stage of ADHD than they are now, based entirely on children as they originally were in earlier DSMs.  But the decisions made by the  APA are also political, not just scientifically based, so its hard to know where this will go.

I teach clinicians to ignore it and also use 4 symptoms endorsed on either list as the threshold to diagnose as its more science based.

You can read more about SCT on my website under Fact Sheets and also using Google Scholar to find journal articles.  Briefly, its characterized more by daydreaming, staring, spaciness, mental confusion, underactivity, even slowness to react or respond.  We are studying if it is a pathological form of mind wandering or daydreaming or mind blanking or all three.  Half of people with SCT also have ADHD and vice versa, but the other half do not.  SCT is related to passivity, social withdrawal or even shyness, risk for depression, and can be seen in autism spectrum disorder.

So I will give you two that stand out understanding there were others as well.  First, that ADHD greatly disrupts the  human sense of time and especially the ability to be governed by ones sense of time passing (time management).  I came upon the idea to test it by reading an essay on how animal and human minds and language/communication may differ.  From it I learned that disinhibition is related to sense of time.  So I tested it first in ADHD in children, then later in teens, adults, and my 25 year follow up study.  People at any age with ADHD were very impaired in time management and time sense.  No one had ever said that or predicted it until then.  And it was not a subtle but a massive deficit, especially when we measured it through ratings of time sense and time management, not just lab measures.  I was blown away.  Now its a rock solid finding in the ADHD literature and led me to coin the term time blind or future myopia for the condition.

The second one came in late 2018-2019.  I have always suspected that ADHD adversely affects health, and we knew it caused more accidental injuries and even early mortality from them.  But in my longitudinal study in Milwaukee we were documenting all kinds of health and medical issues as the kids became adults, from obesity, poor nutrition, impaired sleep, increased smoking, excess alcohol use, poor driving, lousy cholesterol panels, etc.  But in that year I found a way to combine all that information into a calculator that can estimate life expectancy based on 14 human factors.  No one had studied that before.  But we had all 14 of those factors in my study.  The results from the calculations were stunning and sobering.  I had to run them a second time and check all the data entry to make sure we made no mistakes.  We had not.  A diagnosis of ADHD in childhood was associated with a 9-10 year reduction in life expectancy and if the condition persisted to age 27 the reduction was 12-13 years.  That is huge!  Greater than any major health variable we try to change in people these days so they live longer.  Why, because  ADHD is predisposing to many such adverse lifestyle and health factors that all add up to a considerable reduction in lifespan if not treated.  So that was my second surprise.

The drug company package inserts advise against taking them when pregnant but that is just to protect them from future liability.  The latest approach is for a physician to have a long and sensitive discussion of the risks and benefits.  After all, there are considerable risks posed by stopping medication, such as increased risks for accidental injuries, car crashes, suicide, anxiety, depression, early mortality, obesity, impaired employment, difficulties managing a household or other children, etc.  All that risk comes back if the medications are ceased.

 Ans: This is an important but tough question.  And presently we don't have a lot of research on the possible toxic (teratogenic) effects of ADHD medications on the fetus if  used by a pregnant woman.  However, this past year or two several large scale population wide studies (Denmark, Sweden, etc.) looked at any risk for major malformations int he babies in women who continued on meds and those who didn't.  They found none except both studies found a small increased risk for heart malformations (about 2-3% as I recall) over what was seen in moms not taking the meds.

In what ways does ADHD interact with high intelligence (IQ &amp;gt; 130)? Do children/adults with high IQ get diagnosed later in life, due to them being able to go through most of school without having to rely on concentration or having to learn?

Does the treatment of these children/adults differ from the treatment of patients with average IQ?

ADHD does not interact much with IQ.  its the same disorder in intelligent and typical people.  High IQ merely protects one from an earlier onset of educational problems.  Otherwise, it provides no protection from other nonacademic impairments.

Treatment does not differ based on IQ.

There is no research on self-worth in high IQ people with ADHD.

Evidence for mindfulness based practices is promising but better controlled studies are needed.  See the new book on this for adult ADHD by Zylowska and Mitchell ([www.guilford.com](https://www.guilford.com) or Amazon).  There review of the available evidence indicates it may be helpful for some aspects of ADHD but even that is inconsistent at the moment.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The 30% rule about which I often speak is merely a rough clinically derived approximation for how far behind a typical child with ADHD may be from their more typical peers in their development of self-regulation (SR)(executive functioning, or EF).  I developed the concept while writing the first edition of my book for parents (Taking Charge of ADHD) but also while practicing clinically at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center from 1985-2002.  I was searching for a means by which to counsel parents and teachers on the extent to which such children were behind others of their age so as to get adults to understand the concept of a delay and the need to adjust one’s expectations down to a more appropriate level for a child so delayed.  Even back then, ADHD was considered to be developmental in nature and best considered as a delay in development, not a loss of previously normal functioning as in someone with an injury.  That idea was borrowed from two other neurodevelopmental disorders - intellectual disability and learning disorders.  For both, we often speak about the functional developmental level of the child in the domain of their delay, in those cases intelligence and learning (reading, math, spelling, language etc.) specifically.  Indeed, in the field of intelligence research, the concept of a mental age rather than an IQ was used for years in clinical work with families of such children.  
The rule is not based on a single scientific study of that issue, which would be far too time consuming and expensive to conduct.  Instead, I was searching for a clinical rule or concept, not one of exact scientific specification as derived from a single such study.  So I went back into my own published research studies and that of many others and simply wrote down the extent to which the ADHD group's performance differed from that of typical children in the same study and looked at a wide range of children’s ages.  I did this for a wide variety of measures of EF, child social behaviors, and others.  The range of deficits was from about 25-41% or so.  The average was 32% but that is not as good for clinical use as is using a nice round number when speaking to parents.  So I rounded it down to 30%.  On average, then, a child with ADHD seems to perform about 30% behind others of their age in their EF and self-regulation.  Don't let the exact number distract you from the point of this exercise.  It is clearly a rough (imprecise) rule based on a back of the envelop type of calculation. But it worked brilliantly in advising families and others about how to understand the concept of a delay in EF, or one’s functional executive age, and start thinking about where their own child might be in that level of delay.  The point of the rule is for families to understand not just the concept of a delay but, more important to its purpose, also about the need to lower expectations to better fit with their child’s delayed level of EF/SR.    
So there is no single scientific paper of mine to send you.  And the number itself is a crude approximation.  Instead, one views the 30% rule as an imprecise estimate so as to better convey a concept of delayed EF/SR to families and teachers and, most importantly, the need to match expectations to functional levels of EF/SR performance.  
I am so glad to know that my work has been of value to you in understanding ADHD and its management.</span></div></div>

I would like to know tips, tricks, and strategies for adults who want to go back to school.  
How do we go about picking a field of study when we impulsively dive into an exciting new topic, only to get bored with it before finishing a degree?  I have a few core ideas I come back to, but worry they won't lead to a career that would be worth taking on the work and debt of school.  Or I'd start a career and burn out five years later.
How do we navigate the system of actually applying and getting to the first day of classes?  
What are the pros and cons of working with student disability services for accommodations?  How do we work with professors so we can do well in classes?

I'd also like to know more about rejection sensitivity as a concept/symptom vs rejection sensitive dysphoria which seems to be viewed more like a diagnosis. How much of a difference does the word "dysphoria" make when talking about this subject?</span></div></div>
