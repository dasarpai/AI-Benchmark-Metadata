approaches beyond scope paper noted approaches used serve backbone cryptocurrency bitcoin state transition system ethereum state transition technical standpoint ledger cryptocurrency bitcoin thought state transition system state consisting ownership status existing bitcoins state transition function takes state transaction outputs new state result standard banking system example state balance sheet transaction request move x b state transition function reduces value account x increases value b account x account less x first place state transition function returns error hence one formally define apply tx error banking system defined apply alice bob send alice bob alice bob apply alice bob send alice bob error state bitcoin collection coins technically unspent transaction outputs utxo

btc bob address owner second output remaining btc change owner alice mining ethereum blocks access trustworthy centralized service system would trivial implement could simply coded exactly described using centralized server hard drive keep track state however bitcoin trying build decentralized currency system need combine state transaction system consensus system order ensure everyone agrees order transactions bitcoin decentralized consensus process requires nodes network continuously attempt produce packages transactions called blocks network intended produce roughly one block every ten minutes block containing timestamp nonce reference ie hash previous block list transactions taken place since previous block time creates persistent ever growing blockchain constantly updates represent latest state bitcoin ledger algorithm checking block valid expressed paradigm follows check previous block referenced block exists valid check timestamp block greater previous blockfn less hours future check proof work block valid let state end previous block suppose tx block transaction list n transactions n set apply tx application returns error exit return false return true register n state end block essentially transaction block must provide valid state transition canonical state transaction executed new state note state encoded block way purely abstraction remembered validating node securely computed block starting genesis state sequentially applying every transaction every block additionally note order miner includes transactions block matters two transactions b block b spends utxo created block valid comes b otherwise one validity condition present list found systems requirement proof work precise condition double sha hash every block treated bit number must less dynamically adjusted target time writing approximately purpose make block creation computationally hard thereby preventing sybil attackers remaking entire blockchain favor sha designed completely unpredictable pseudorandom function way create valid block simply trial error repeatedly incrementing nonce seeing new hash matches current target network must make average tries valid block found general target recalibrated network every blocks average new block produced node network every ten minutes order compensate miners computational work miner every block entitled include transaction giving btc nowhere additionally transaction higher total denomination inputs outputs difference also goes miner transaction fee incidentally also mechanism btc issued genesis state contained coins order better understand purpose mining let us examine happens event malicious attacker since bitcoin underlying cryptography known secure attacker target one part bitcoin system protected cryptography directly order transactions attacker strategy simple send btc merchant exchange product preferably rapid delivery digital good wait delivery product produce another transaction sending btc try convince network transaction one came first step taken place minutes miner include transaction block say block number one hour five blocks added chain block blocks indirectly pointing transaction thus confirming point merchant accept payment finalized deliver product since assuming digital good delivery instant attacker creates another transaction sending btc attacker simply releases wild transaction processed miners attempt run apply tx notice tx consumes utxo longer state instead attacker creates fork blockchain starting mining another version block pointing block parent new transaction place old one block data different requires redoing proof work furthermore attacker new version block different hash original blocks point thus original chain attacker new chain completely separate rule fork longest blockchain taken truth legitimate miners work chain attacker alone working chain order attacker make blockchain longest would need computational power rest network combined order catch hence attack merkle trees spv bitcoin left suffices present small number nodes merkle tree give proof validity branch right attempt change part merkle tree eventually lead inconsistency somewhere chain important scalability feature bitcoin block stored multi level data structure hash block actually hash block header roughly byte piece data contains timestamp nonce previous block hash root hash data structure called merkle tree storing transactions block merkle tree type binary tree composed set nodes large number leaf nodes bottom tree containing underlying data set intermediate

alternative blockchain applications idea taking underlying blockchain idea applying concepts also long history nick szabo came concept secure property titles owner authority document describing new advances replicated database technology allow blockchain based system storing registry owns land creating elaborate framework including concepts homesteading adverse possession georgian land tax however unfortunately effective replicated database system available time protocol never implemented practice however bitcoin decentralized consensus developed number alternative applications rapidly began emerge namecoin created namecoin best described decentralized name registration database decentralized protocols like tor bitcoin bitmessage needs way identifying accounts people interact existing solutions kind identifier available pseudorandom hash like lwwpzbqahwjltcibcrhqythaguwy ideally one would like able account name like george however problem one person create account named

successful implementation name registration system using idea colored coins purpose colored coins serve protocol allow people create digital currencies important trivial case currency one unit digital tokens bitcoin blockchain colored coins protocol one issues new currency publicly assigning color specific bitcoin utxo protocol recursively defines color utxo color inputs transaction creating spent special rules apply case mixed color inputs allows users maintain wallets containing utxo specific color send around much like regular bitcoins backtracking blockchain determine color utxo receive metacoins idea behind metacoin protocol lives top bitcoin using bitcoin transactions store metacoin transactions different state transition function apply metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions appearing bitcoin blockchain rule added apply tx returns error protocol defaults apply tx provides easy mechanism creating arbitrary cryptocurrency protocol potentially advanced features cannot implemented inside bitcoin low development cost since complexities mining networking already handled bitcoin protocol metacoins used implement classes financial contracts name registration decentralized exchange thus general two approaches toward building consensus protocol building independent network building protocol top bitcoin former approach reasonably successful case applications like namecoin difficult implement individual implementation needs bootstrap independent blockchain well building testing necessary state transition networking code additionally predict set applications decentralized consensus technology follow power law distribution vast majority applications would small warrant blockchain note exist large classes decentralized applications particularly decentralized autonomous organizations need interact bitcoin based approach hand flaw inherit simplified payment verification features bitcoin spv works bitcoin use blockchain depth proxy validity point ancestors transaction go far enough back safe say legitimately part state blockchain based meta protocols hand cannot force blockchain include transactions valid within context protocols hence fully secure spv meta protocol implementation would need backward scan way beginning bitcoin blockchain determine whether certain transactions valid currently light implementations bitcoin based meta protocols rely trusted server provide data arguably highly suboptimal result especially one primary purposes cryptocurrency eliminate need trust scripting even without extensions bitcoin protocol actually facilitate weak version concept smart contracts utxo bitcoin owned public key also complicated script expressed simple stack based programming language paradigm transaction spending utxo must provide data satisfies script indeed even basic public key ownership mechanism implemented via script script takes elliptic curve signature input verifies transaction address owns utxo returns verification successful otherwise complicated scripts exist various additional use cases example one construct script requires signatures two given three private keys validate multisig setup useful corporate accounts secure savings accounts merchant escrow situations scripts also used pay bounties solutions computational problems one even construct script says something like bitcoin utxo provide spv proof sent dogecoin transaction denomination essentially allowing decentralized cross cryptocurrency exchange however scripting language implemented bitcoin several important limitations lack turing completeness say large subset computation bitcoin scripting language supports nearly support everything main category missing loops done avoid infinite loops transaction verification theoretically surmountable obstacle script programmers since loop simulated simply repeating underlying code many times statement lead scripts space inefficient example implementing alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require repeated multiplication rounds individually included code value blindness way utxo script provide fine grained control amount withdrawn example one powerful use case oracle contract would hedging contract b put worth btc days script sends worth btc rest b would require oracle determine value btc usd even massive improvement terms trust infrastructure requirement fully centralized solutions available however utxo nothing way achieve inefficient hack many utxo varying denominations eg one utxo k every k pick utxo send b lack state utxo either spent unspent opportunity multi stage contracts scripts keep internal state beyond makes hard make multi stage options contracts decentralized exchange offers two stage cryptographic commitment protocols necessary secure computational bounties also means utxo used build simple one contracts complex stateful contracts decentralized organizations makes meta protocols difficult implement binary state combined value blindness also mean another important application withdrawal limits impossible blockchain blindness utxo blind blockchain data nonce timestamp previous block hash severely limits applications gambling several categories depriving scripting language potentially valuable source randomness thus see three approaches building advanced applications top cryptocurrency building new blockchain using scripting top bitcoin building meta protocol top bitcoin building new blockchain allows unlimited freedom building feature set cost development time bootstrapping effort security using scripting easy implement standardize limited capabilities meta protocols easy suffer faults scalability ethereum intend build alternative framework provides even

protocol implementation would need backward scan way beginning bitcoin blockchain determine whether certain transactions valid currently light implementations bitcoin based meta protocols rely trusted server provide data arguably highly suboptimal result especially one primary purposes cryptocurrency eliminate need trust scripting even without extensions bitcoin protocol actually facilitate weak version concept smart contracts utxo bitcoin owned public key also complicated script expressed simple stack based programming language paradigm transaction spending utxo must provide data satisfies script indeed even basic public key ownership mechanism implemented via script script takes elliptic curve signature input verifies transaction address owns utxo returns verification successful otherwise complicated scripts exist various additional use cases example one construct script requires signatures two given three private keys validate multisig setup useful corporate accounts secure savings accounts merchant escrow situations scripts also used pay bounties solutions computational problems one even construct script says something like bitcoin utxo provide spv proof sent dogecoin transaction denomination essentially allowing decentralized cross cryptocurrency exchange however scripting language implemented bitcoin several important limitations lack turing completeness say large subset computation bitcoin scripting language supports nearly support everything main category missing loops done avoid infinite loops transaction verification theoretically surmountable obstacle script programmers since loop simulated simply repeating underlying code many times statement lead scripts space inefficient example implementing alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require repeated multiplication rounds individually included code value blindness way utxo script provide fine grained control amount withdrawn example one powerful use case oracle contract would hedging contract b put worth btc days script sends worth btc rest b would require oracle determine value btc usd even massive improvement terms trust infrastructure requirement fully centralized solutions available however utxo nothing way achieve inefficient hack many utxo varying denominations eg one utxo k every k pick utxo send b lack state utxo either spent unspent opportunity multi stage contracts scripts keep internal state beyond makes hard make multi stage options contracts decentralized exchange offers two stage cryptographic commitment protocols necessary secure computational bounties also means utxo used build simple one contracts complex stateful contracts decentralized organizations makes meta protocols difficult implement binary state combined value blindness also mean another important application withdrawal limits impossible blockchain blindness utxo blind blockchain data nonce timestamp previous block hash severely limits applications gambling several categories depriving scripting language potentially valuable source randomness thus see three approaches building advanced applications top cryptocurrency building new blockchain
