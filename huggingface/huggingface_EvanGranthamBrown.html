Earlier, supervised, non-contrastive methods were capable of finer-grained alignment, but required dense annotations that were not scalable. We propose a single stream architecture that aligns images and language at multiple levels: global, fine-grained patch-token, and conceptual/semantic, using two novel tasks: symmetric cross-modality reconstruction (XMM) and a pseudo-labeled key word prediction (PSL). In XMM, we mask input tokens from one modality and use cross-modal information to reconstruct the masked token, thus improving fine-grained alignment between the two modalities. In PSL, we use attention to select keywords in a caption, use a momentum encoder to recommend other important keywords that are missing from the caption but represented in the image, and then train the visual encoder to predict the presence of those keywords, helping it learn semantic concepts that are essential for grounding a textual token to an image region. We demonstrate competitive performance and improved data efficiency on image-text retrieval, grounding, visual question answering/reasoning against larger models and models trained on more data.

Cities expand rapidly, which leads to increased population growth and exceeding vehicle expansion. A city can increase its commercial prospects, reduce sprawl, and promote a feeling of community through transit-oriented development by incorporating public transportation options and considerations into more comprehensive economic and land use planning. Public transportation benefits both users and non-users since it decreases travel times, air pollution, energy use, and traffic congestion. To better understand the features and advantages of Metro Transit, surveys on car ownership, transit use frequency, and trip purpose are crucial. These surveys are nothing more than case studies of specific transit operators from all throughout the country. Case studies explore the various city conditions, the role of MRTS problems which are created by them, problems solved by them and to envisage the future problems over a period of time. They also provide the clarity of the various issues and challenges faced by the city at different time of the day. Bengaluru is an outstanding example how a pensioner’s paradise has resulted now as a Meta city. It has undergone a huge metamorphosis trying to solve the various demands put forth by the economic activities. Transit oriented development(TOD) seems the logical way to address the traffic and transportation problems which results in a mixeduse development, high rise, high density. After Delhi and Hyderabad, Bengaluru has entered the queue to embrace Namma Metro and implement Phases 2A and 2B after Phases 1 and 2. An inventory into selected case studies will relate and differentiate the conditions and systems in Bengaluru thus enriching our capability to tackle the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) issues at bay.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, METRO RAIL, CASE STUDY, NAMMA METRO, BENGALURU, TOD&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This paper is concerned with the well-posedness of a diffusion-reaction system for a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model. This model is written in terms of four nonlinear partial differential equations with nonlinear diffusions, depending on the total amount of the SEIR populations. The model aims at describing the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a variation of the one recently introduced, discussed and tested in [A. Viguerie et al, Diffusion-reaction compartmental models formulated in a continuum mechanics framework: application to COVID-19, mathematical analysis, and numerical study, Comput. Mech. 66 (2020) 1131-1152]. Here, we deal with the mathematical analysis of the resulting Cauchy–Neumann problem: the existence of solutions is proved in a rather general setting and a suitable time discretization procedure is employed. It is worth mentioning that the uniform boundedness of the discrete solution is shown by carefully exploiting the structure of the system. Uniform estimates and passage to the limit with respect to the time step allow to complete the existence proof. Then, two uniqueness theorems are offered, one in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient and the other for more regular data, in combination with a regularity result for the solutions.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;COVID-19, COMPARTMENTAL MODEL, PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, DIFF- USION-REACTION SYSTEM, INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM, EXISTENCE OF SOLUTIONS, UNI- QUENESS&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:8,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;8&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this paper we introduce the notion of Shimura’s period symbols over function fields in positive characteristic and establish their fundamental properties.

There are two sides in this controversy. Using extensive data from several industries and areas of research, one side argues that research productivity is currently in decline. The other side disputes this conclusion. It contends that the data used in making this argument are selective and limited; they do not reflect the overall state of research. The conclusion that follows from this critique is that the indicators of research productivity we currently use are not reliable and do not warrant a definitive answer to the problem. The article agrees that we need a new set of indicators in assessing research productivity. It proposes that we should look at global indicators related to knowledge production in general, rather than look at selective data that are inevitably limited in their scope. The article argues that the process of creation plays the essential role in knowledge production. Therefore, the perspective that uses the process of creation as its central organizing principle offers a unique and global view on the production of knowledge and makes a definitive resolution of the controversy possible.

Instead, the analysis showed that the system’s coherence, while changing continuously with entanglement strength on the global scale, remains zero on the local level. This effect, common for bi-photons and bi-fermions, can be named “total mutual intolerance” between local and global coherence.

Given the extent to which the brain has been studied, there is also available ontological knowledge encoding the current state of the art regarding its different areas, activation patterns, key words associated with studies, etc. Furthermore, there is an inherent uncertainty associated with brain scans arising from the mapping between voxels—3D pixels—and actual points in different individual brains. Unfortunately, there is currently no unifying framework for accessing such collections of rich heterogeneous data under uncertainty, making it necessary for researchers to rely on ad hoc tools. In particular, one major weakness of current tools that attempt to address this kind of task is that only very limited propositional query languages have been developed. In this paper, we present NeuroLang, an ontology language with existential rules, probabilistic uncertainty, and built-in mechanisms to guarantee tractable query answering over very large datasets.

Based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional theory, we calculate the most probable transition pathway between the metastable and oscillatory states via a neural shooting method, and further explore the effects of external random carbon input rates on the most probable transition pathway, which provides a basis to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.

Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of 81%, 74%, and 80% for bug reports, enhancements, and questions, respectively.

The metric and topological properties of the ring polymers depend on the phase, and may change abruptly at the critical point. In this paper we examine the thermodynamics and linking of two ring polymers close in space in both the segregated and mixed phases using a cubic lattice model of two polygons interacting with each other. Our results show that the probability of linking is low in the segregated phase, but that it increases through the critical point as the model is taken into the mixed phase.

It is assumed that the process generating the conditional expected ranges at each time point switches between two regimes, labeled as upward market and downward market states. The disturbance term of the error process is also allowed to switch between two distributions depending on the regime. It is assumed that a self-adjusting threshold component that is driven by the past values of the time series determines the current market regime. The proposed model is able to capture aspects such as asymmetric and heteroscedastic behavior of volatility in financial markets. The proposed model is an attempt at addressing several potential deficits found in existing price range models such as the Conditional Autoregressive Range (CARR), Asymmetric CARR (ACARR), Feedback ACARR (FACARR) and Threshold Autoregressive Range (TARR) models. Parameters of the model are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. A simulation study shows that the ML method performs well in estimating the TACARR model parameters. The empirical performance of the TACARR model was investigated using IBM index data and results show that the proposed model is a good alternative for in-sample prediction and out-of-sample forecasting of volatility.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;VOLATILITY MODELING, ASYMMETRIC VOLATILITY, CARR MODELS, REGIME SWITCHING&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:16,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;16&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Koebe problem for univalent polynomials with real coefficients is fully solved only for trinomials, which means that in this case the Koebe radius and the extremal polynomial (extremizer) have been found.

Findings Zwitterionic wetting agents effectively stabilize the tear film by reducing the film thickness at the onset of dewetting, and delaying dewetted region propagation across the lens. Furthermore, tuning wetting agent surface concentrations in binary mixtures can enhance wetting characteristics. Finally, despite disparities in wetting agent molecular properties, the time to dewet 50% of the lens scales linearly with the product of the receding contact angle and contact angle hysteresis.

First, a real mini-scale robot car was assembled and trained on a 6 feet by 9 feet real world track using imitation learning. During the process, a handle controller was used to control the mini-scale robot car to drive on the track by imitating a human expert driver and manually recorded the actions using Microsoft AirSim's API. 331 accurate human-like reward training samples were able to be generated and collected. Then, an agent was trained in the Microsoft AirSim simulator using reinforcement learning for 6 hours with the initial 331 reward data inputted from imitation learning training. After a 6-hour training period, the mini-scale robot car was able to successfully drive full laps around the 6 feet by 9 feet track autonomously while the mini-scale robot car was unable to complete one full lap round the track even after 30 hour training pure RL training. With 80% less training time, the new methodology produced significantly more average rewards per hour. Thus, the new methodology was able to save a significant amount of training time and can be used to accelerate the adoption of RL in autonomous driving, which would help produce more efficient and better results in the long run when applied to real life scenarios.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL), IMITATION LEARNING (IL), AUTONOMOUS DRIVING, HUMAN DRIVING DATA, CNN&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:33,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;33&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The wave-particle duality, while being supported by overwhelming scientific evidence, is now claimed outdated by some physics professionals.

Using 3D datasets instead of 2D traditional images improves the visualization of anatomical structures, and volume visualization helps radiologists and surgeons to review large datasets comprehensively so that diagnosis and treatment can be enhanced. In liver surgery, blood vessel detection is important. Liver vessels have various shapes and due to the presence of noise in the ultrasound images, they can be confused with noise. Suboptimal images can sometimes lead to surgical errors where the surgeon may cut the blood vessel in error. The ultrasound system is versatile and portable and has the advantage of being able to be used in the operating theatre. Due to the nature of B-mode ultrasound, 1-D transfer function volume visualization of images cannot abrogate shadow artifacts. While multi-dimensional transfer function improves the ability to define features of interest, the high dimensionality in the parameter domain renders it unwieldy and difficult for clinicians to work with. To overcome these limitations, an algorithm for volume visualization that can provide effective 3D visualization of noisy B-mode ultrasound images, which can be useful for clinicians, is proposed. We propose a method that is appropriate for liver ultrasound images focusing on vessels and tumors (if present) in order to delineate their structure and positions clearly to preempt surgical error during operation. This method can prevent possible errors during liver surgery by providing more detailed high quality 3D images for clinicians&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;VISUALIZATION, 3D ULTRASOUND IMAGE, VOLUME RENDERING, LIVER SURGERY, LIVER VESSELS&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:36,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;36&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;We consider a risk-sensitive optimization of consumption-utility on infinite time horizon where the one-period investment gain depends on an underlying economic state whose evolution over time is assumed to be described by a discrete-time, finite-state, Markov chain.

For the sake of generality, the utility and the production functions are allowed to be unbounded from above. Under the Markov regime-switching model, it is shown that the value function of optimization problem satisfies an optimality equation and that the optimality equation has a unique solution in a particular class of functions. Furthermore, we show that an optimal policy exists in the class of stationary policies. We also derive the Euler equation of optimal consumption. Furthermore, the existence of the unique joint stationary distribution of the optimal growth process and the underlying regime process is examined.

These methods are tested on synthetic data sets and will be implemented on subsets of a real university campus WIFI data set. The applicability of all methods are discussed, where we provide insights on both some of their benefits and pitfalls. This article ends with our conclusion on which method is better for our WIFI data. Time series data is generated in practically every discipline, and it comes in countless forms. This means that analyzing time series data is important, and potential new approaches that can be developed and used to extract information from them can lead to recognizing important new patterns and possibly to lead to new insights and discoveries. In this article, novel Least Squares techniques that are \&quot;data driven\&quot; are presented. The approaches presented provide a powerful framework that allows polynomial regression, and differentiation, of virtually any set of data points, including time series and streaming data. We also present a different point of view on the problem and propose improvements to previous algorithms. To develop the derivative approximations we implement a degree finder that allows us to create low error approximations.

As is believed usually, a new particle suits the conditions that the ratio of the width to the mass is less than 1−3% and a narrow width approximation (NWA) is applicable to identify such type resonant peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the collision products. In the present paper, in the framework of generalized Yukawa model, we find out the properties of the searched particle when its width is larger than a maximal one expected during experiments and so this state could be confused with a noise. We also ascertain the values of particle’s parameters when the NWA is not applicable and estimate the width value when it happens. These estimations are relevant to interactions between the Standard model and dark matter particles. Such approach is focused on the role of couplings and mass values introduced in the model describing interaction of visible and dark matter&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;DARK MATTER, RESONANCE, NARROW WIDTH APPROXIMATION, MIXING OF FIELDS&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:41,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;41&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In our paper the new algorithm enhanced multi gradient Dilution Preparation (EMDP) is discussed.

Here, in the case of the viscous system, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution as the parameter σ appearing in the operator B2σ decreasingly tends to zero.

In Bangladesh, where bureaucracy and legislature operate with little effective accountability or checks and balances, traditional horizontal or vertical accountability proved to be very blunt and weak. In the presence of such faulty mechanisms, ordinary citizens access to information is frequently denied, and their voices are kept mute. It impasses the formation of an enabling environment, where activists and civil society institutions representing the ordinary peoples interest are actively discouraged. They become vulnerable to retribution. Social accountability, on the other hand, provides an enabling environment for activists and civil society institutions to operate freely. Thus, leaders and administration become more accountable to people. An enabling environment means providing legal protection, enhancing the availability of information and increasing citizen voice, strengthening institutional and public service capacities and directing incentives that foster accountability. Donors allocate significant shares of resources to encouraging civil society to partner with elites rather than holding them accountable.

However, annotations of large scale datasets in FER has been a key challenge as these datasets suffer from noise due to various factors like crowd sourcing, subjectivity of annotators, poor quality of images, automatic labelling based on key word search etc. Such noisy annotations impede the performance of FER due to the memorization ability of deep networks. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This report presents Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework used in our submission to expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) 2021 competition. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage.

In this case, the matrix A is said to be Hurwitz stable or shortly a stable matrix. In practice, stability of a system can be violated because of arbitrarily small perturbations such as modeling errors. In such cases, one deals with the robust stability of the system rather than its stability. The system above is said to be robustly stable if the system, as well as all of its arbitrarily small perturbations, are stable. To measure the robustness of the system subject to perturbations, a quantity of interest is the stability radius or in other words distance to instability. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the structured real stability radius for large-scale systems. We propose a subspace framework to estimate the structured real stability radius and prove that our new method converges at a quadratic rate in theory. Our method benefits from a onesided interpolatory model order reduction technique, in a sense that the left and the right subspaces are the same.

Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision rules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available information about the individual's status and progress should be used in practice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver. The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental design widely used to empirically inform the development of DTRs. Sample size planning resources for SMARTs have been developed for continuous, binary, and survival outcomes. However, an important gap exists in sample size estimation methodology for SMARTs with longitudinal count outcomes. Further, in many health domains, count data are overdispersed - having variance greater than their mean.

Available hardware restricts the Hamiltonians to be of a structure that allows only pairwise interactions, an aspect that will likely remain for the foreseeable future. This requires that the original optimization problem to be first converted – from its polynomial form – to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which we frame as a problem in algebraic geometry. Additionally, the hardware graph where such a QUBO-Hamiltonian needs to be embedded – assigning variables of the problem to the qubits of the physical optimizer – is not a complete graph, but rather one with limited connectivity. This “problem graph to hardware graph” embedding can also be framed as a problem of computing a Groebner basis of a certain specially constructed polynomial ideal. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational approach to prepare a given polynomial optimization problem for AQC in three steps. The first step reduces an input polynomial optimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner basis of a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function. The second step computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian associated to a given embedding. These steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial optimization problem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure that can be used directly as a translator to solve polynomial integer optimization. Alternatively, it can be used as a test-bed (with small size problems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum compilers by studying various choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive manner.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently suffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be tightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous advection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has recently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the gas’ radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the traditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the disk’s viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of orbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have performed 2D (r, θ) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded in locally isothermal α-disks in steadystate accretion, with various values of α. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to diminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the migration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk’s viscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We show that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions. From these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a giant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while the gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus limiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk’s viscosity. Hence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration should still be very slow.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, PLANET-DISK INTERACTIONS, PLANETS AND SATELLITES: FORMATION&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:78,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;78&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The aim of the paper is to show that the presence of one possible type of outliers is not connected to that of heavy tails of the distribution.

We find that the magnetic moments and the g-factors do show a particle number independent behavior in multi-j configura- tions, as expected in the seniority scheme. The calculated results explain the experimental trends quite well. We find that the g-factors of all the seniority states arising from a given multi-j configuration for identical nucleons is equal to the g-factor of the seniority v = 1 state from that configuration. Also, the g-factors are found to be a sensitive probe for fixing the multi-j configuration, which are fully consistent with the configurations assigned to explain the B(EL) properties in our previous works.

This source of information constitutes a rich input for data analytics processes, either offline (e.g. cluster analysis, hot motion discovery) or online (e.g. short-term forecasting of forthcoming positions). This paper focuses on predictive analytics for moving objects (could be pedestrians, cars, vessels, planes, animals, etc.) and surveys the state-of-the-art in the context of future location and trajectory prediction. We provide an extensive review of over 50 works, also proposing a novel taxonomy of predictive algorithms over moving objects. We also list the properties of several real datasets used in the past for validation purposes of those works and, motivated by this, we discuss challenges that arise in the transition from conventional to Big Data applications.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;mobility data, moving object trajectories, trajectory prediction, future location prediction&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:81,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;81&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In the recent paper “Well-posedness and regularity for a generalized fractional Cahn–Hilliard system” by the same authors, general well-posedness results have been established for a a class of evolutionary systems of two equations having the structure of a viscous Cahn–Hilliard system, in which nonlinearities of double-well type occur. The operators appearing in the system equations are fractional versions in the spectral sense of general linear operators A, B having compact resolvents, which are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and monotone in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain. In this work we complement the results given in the quoted paper by studying a distributed control problem for this evolu- tionary system. The main difficulty in the analysis is to establish a rigorous Fr ́echet differentiability result for the associated control-to-state mapping. This seems only to be possible if the state stays bounded, which, in turn, makes it necessary to postulate an additional global boundedness assumption. One typical situation, in which this assumption is satisfied, arises when B is the negative Laplacian with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and the nonlinearity is smooth with polynomial growth of at most order four. Also a case with logarithmic nonlinearity can be handled. Under the global boundedness assumption, we establish existence and first-order necessary optimality conditions for the optimal control problem in terms of a variational inequality and the associated adjoint state system.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;fractional operators, Cahn-Hilliard systems, optimal control, necessary optimality conditions&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:81,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:82,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;82&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Purpose: An approach for the automated segmentation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcu- taneous adipose tissue (SAT) in multicenter water-fat MRI scans of the abdomen was investigated, using two different neural network architectures. Methods: The two fully convolutional network architectures U-Net and V-Net were trained, evalu- ated and compared on the water-fat MRI data. Data of the study Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold cross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks was determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the multicenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity (BetaJudo), which involved a different study population and scanning device. Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both cross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average dice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute quantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the multi-center test data, the U-Net performs only slightly worse, with average dice scores of 0.970 (VAT) and 0.987 (SAT) and quantification errors of 2.80% (VAT) and 1.65% (SAT). Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable quantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated measurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale stud- ies with minimal need for human intervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore shows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient demographics and imaging centers, as long as a consistent imaging protocol is used.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;deep learning, fully convolutional networks, segmentation, water-fat MRI, adipose tissue, abdominal&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:82,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:83,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;83&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Nowadays, metaheuristic optimization algorithms are used to find the global optima in difficult search spaces. Pontogammarus Maeoticus Swarm Optimization (PMSO) is a metaheuristic algorithm imitating aquatic nature and foraging behavior. Pontogammarus Maeoticus, also called Gammarus in short, is a tiny creature found mostly in coast of Caspian Sea in Iran. In this algorithm, global optima is modeled as sea edge (coast) to which Gammarus creatures are willing to move in order to rest from sea waves and forage in sand. Sea waves satisfy exploration and foraging models exploitation. The strength of sea wave is determined according to distance of Gammarus from sea edge. The angles of waves applied on several particles are set randomly helping algorithm not be stuck in local bests. Meanwhile, the neighborhood of particles change adaptively resulting in more efficient progress in searching. The proposed algorithm, although is applicable on any optimization problem, is experimented for partially shaded solar PV array. Experiments on CEC05 benchmarks, as well as solar PV array, show the effectiveness of this optimization algorithm.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Pontogammarus Maeoticus, Gammarus swarm, metaheuristic optimization&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:83,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:84,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;84&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;We are interested in topological and ergodic properties of one dimen- sional cellular automata.

The operators A and B are supposed to be densely defined, unbounded, self-adjoint, monotone in the Hilbert space L2(Ω), for some bounded and smooth domain Ω, and have compact resolvents. Our definition of the fractional powers of operators uses the approach via spectral theory. A nonlinearity of double-well type occurs in the phase equation and either a regular or logarithmic potential, as well as a non-differentiable potential involving an indicator function, is admitted in our approach. We show general well-posedness and regularity results, extending the corresponding results that are known for the non-fractional elliptic operators with zero Neumann conditions or other boundary conditions like Dirichlet or Robin ones. Then, we investigate the longtime behavior of the system, by fully characterizing every element of the ω-limit as a stationary solution. In the final part of the paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the system a as the parameter σ appearing in the operator B2σ that plays in the phase equation decreasingly tends to zero. We can prove convergence to a phase relaxation problem at the limit, in which an additional term containing the projection of the phase variable on the kernel of B appears.&quot;},&quot;CLEANED KEYWORDS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fractional operators, Allen-Cahn equations, phase field system, well-posedness, regularity, asymptotics&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;RESULT #&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:86,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;86&quot;},&quot;CLEANED ABSTRACT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;We obtain the best possible upper bounds for the moments of a single order statistic from independent, non-negative random variables, in terms of the pop- ulation mean.

They approach the Earth and other planets in the complex pattern of rigidity’s dependence, generally excluded by the magnetosphere. GCRs revealed by images of single nuclear reactions also called spallation events are described here. Such an event was seen on Nov. 29, 2015 using a unique LASCO C3 space coronagraph routine image taken during the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) mission observing uninterruptedly at the Lagrangian L1 point. The spallation signature of a GCR identified well outside the Earth’s magnetosphere is obtained for the 1st time. The resulting image includes different diverging linear \&quot;tracks\&quot; of varying intensity, leading to a single pixel; this frame identifies the site on the silicon CCD chip of the coronagraph camera. There was no solar flare reported at that time, nor Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and no evidence of optical debris around the spacecraft. More examples of smaller CR events have been discovered through the 20 years of continuous observations from SoHO. This is the first spallation event from a CR, recorded outside the Earth’s magnetosphere.

Earlier, supervised, non-contrastive methods were capable of finer-grained alignment, but required dense annotations that were not scalable. We propose a single stream architecture that aligns images and language at multiple levels: global, fine-grained patch-token, and conceptual/semantic, using two novel tasks: symmetric cross-modality reconstruction (XMM) and a pseudo-labeled key word prediction (PSL). In XMM, we mask input tokens from one modality and use cross-modal information to reconstruct the masked token, thus improving fine-grained alignment between the two modalities. In PSL, we use attention to select keywords in a caption, use a momentum encoder to recommend other important keywords that are missing from the caption but represented in the image, and then train the visual encoder to predict the presence of those keywords, helping it learn semantic concepts that are essential for grounding a textual token to an image region. We demonstrate competitive performance and improved data efficiency on image-text retrieval, grounding, visual question answering/reasoning against larger models and models trained on more data.

Cities expand rapidly, which leads to increased population growth and exceeding vehicle expansion. A city can increase its commercial prospects, reduce sprawl, and promote a feeling of community through transit-oriented development by incorporating public transportation options and considerations into more comprehensive economic and land use planning. Public transportation benefits both users and non-users since it decreases travel times, air pollution, energy use, and traffic congestion. To better understand the features and advantages of Metro Transit, surveys on car ownership, transit use frequency, and trip purpose are crucial. These surveys are nothing more than case studies of specific transit operators from all throughout the country. Case studies explore the various city conditions, the role of MRTS problems which are created by them, problems solved by them and to envisage the future problems over a period of time. They also provide the clarity of the various issues and challenges faced by the city at different time of the day. Bengaluru is an outstanding example how a pensioner’s paradise has resulted now as a Meta city. It has undergone a huge metamorphosis trying to solve the various demands put forth by the economic activities. Transit oriented development(TOD) seems the logical way to address the traffic and transportation problems which results in a mixeduse development, high rise, high density. After Delhi and Hyderabad, Bengaluru has entered the queue to embrace Namma Metro and implement Phases 2A and 2B after Phases 1 and 2. An inventory into selected case studies will relate and differentiate the conditions and systems in Bengaluru thus enriching our capability to tackle the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) issues at bay.</span></div></div>

The model aims at describing the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a variation of the one recently introduced, discussed and tested in [A. Viguerie et al, Diffusion-reaction compartmental models formulated in a continuum mechanics framework: application to COVID-19, mathematical analysis, and numerical study, Comput. Mech. 66 (2020) 1131-1152]. Here, we deal with the mathematical analysis of the resulting Cauchy–Neumann problem: the existence of solutions is proved in a rather general setting and a suitable time discretization procedure is employed. It is worth mentioning that the uniform boundedness of the discrete solution is shown by carefully exploiting the structure of the system. Uniform estimates and passage to the limit with respect to the time step allow to complete the existence proof. Then, two uniqueness theorems are offered, one in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient and the other for more regular data, in combination with a regularity result for the solutions.</span></div></div>

There are two sides in this controversy. Using extensive data from several industries and areas of research, one side argues that research productivity is currently in decline. The other side disputes this conclusion. It contends that the data used in making this argument are selective and limited; they do not reflect the overall state of research. The conclusion that follows from this critique is that the indicators of research productivity we currently use are not reliable and do not warrant a definitive answer to the problem. The article agrees that we need a new set of indicators in assessing research productivity. It proposes that we should look at global indicators related to knowledge production in general, rather than look at selective data that are inevitably limited in their scope. The article argues that the process of creation plays the essential role in knowledge production. Therefore, the perspective that uses the process of creation as its central organizing principle offers a unique and global view on the production of knowledge and makes a definitive resolution of the controversy possible. The article also outlines some steps for improving research productivity and realizing the full potential of the human capacity to produce knowledge.</span></div></div>

The detailed comparison of the two cases showed the range of distinctions and similarities in their monitoring. The general results contradict the “Concurrency Rule” stating that intimately linked characteristics of a simple system must change concurrently under changing conditions. Instead, the analysis showed that the system’s coherence, while changing continuously with entanglement strength on the global scale, remains zero on the local level. This effect, common for bi-photons and bi-fermions, can be named “total mutual intolerance” between local and global coherence. We can thus predict mutual intolerance as a general effect for all pairs of entangled qubits regardless of their physical nature</span></div></div>

Given the extent to which the brain has been studied, there is also available ontological knowledge encoding the current state of the art regarding its different areas, activation patterns, key words associated with studies, etc. Furthermore, there is an inherent uncertainty associated with brain scans arising from the mapping between voxels—3D pixels—and actual points in different individual brains. Unfortunately, there is currently no unifying framework for accessing such collections of rich heterogeneous data under uncertainty, making it necessary for researchers to rely on ad hoc tools. In particular, one major weakness of current tools that attempt to address this kind of task is that only very limited propositional query languages have been developed. In this paper, we present NeuroLang, an ontology language with existential rules, probabilistic uncertainty, and built-in mechanisms to guarantee tractable query answering over very large datasets. After presenting the language and its general query answering architecture, we discuss real-world use cases showing how NeuroLang can be applied to practical scenarios for which current tools are inadequate.</span></div></div>

Particularly, we investigate the effect of the transition time on the transition pathway and further compute the optimal transition time using physics informed neural network, towards the maximum carbonate concentration state in the oscillatory regimes.

Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of 81%, 74%, and 80% for bug reports, enhancements, and questions, respectively. We also develop an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), which automatically assigns labels to newly reported issues on GitHub repositories with high accuracy.</span></div></div>

These phases are separated by a critical point which has a θ-point character. The metric and topological properties of the ring polymers depend on the phase, and may change abruptly at the critical point. In this paper we examine the thermodynamics and linking of two ring polymers close in space in both the segregated and mixed phases using a cubic lattice model of two polygons interacting with each other. Our results show that the probability of linking is low in the segregated phase, but that it increases through the critical point as the model is taken into the mixed phase.

It is assumed that the process generating the conditional expected ranges at each time point switches between two regimes, labeled as upward market and downward market states. The disturbance term of the error process is also allowed to switch between two distributions depending on the regime. It is assumed that a self-adjusting threshold component that is driven by the past values of the time series determines the current market regime. The proposed model is able to capture aspects such as asymmetric and heteroscedastic behavior of volatility in financial markets. The proposed model is an attempt at addressing several potential deficits found in existing price range models such as the Conditional Autoregressive Range (CARR), Asymmetric CARR (ACARR), Feedback ACARR (FACARR) and Threshold Autoregressive Range (TARR) models. Parameters of the model are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. A simulation study shows that the ML method performs well in estimating the TACARR model parameters. The empirical performance of the TACARR model was investigated using IBM index data and results show that the proposed model is a good alternative for in-sample prediction and out-of-sample forecasting of volatility.</span></div></div>

The present work is motivated from an elementary statistical problem, namely, the unbiased estimation of a parametric function of the scale in the basic model of a random sample from exponential distribution. The form of the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of a parametric function h(λ), as well as its variance, are obtained as series in Laguerre polynomials and the corresponding Fourier coefficients, and a particular application of this result yields a novel inversion formula for the Laplace transform</span></div></div>

Clarifying destabilization characteristics across key physio-chemical variables will provide a rational basis for identifying optimal wetting agents. Experiments We employ an in-house, in vitro platform to comprehensively evaluate drainage and dewetting dynamics of five wetting agents across seventeen different formulations and two model tear film solutions: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and artificial tear solution (ATS). We consider the film thickness evolution, film thickness at breakup, dewetted front propagation, and develop correlations to contact angle to compare the samples. Findings Zwitterionic wetting agents effectively stabilize the tear film by reducing the film thickness at the onset of dewetting, and delaying dewetted region propagation across the lens. Furthermore, tuning wetting agent surface concentrations in binary mixtures can enhance wetting characteristics. Finally, despite disparities in wetting agent molecular properties, the time to dewet 50% of the lens scales linearly with the product of the receding contact angle and contact angle hysteresis. Hence, we fundamentally establish the importance of minimizing both the absolute contact angle values and contact angle hysteresis for effective wetting performance.</span></div></div>

This research develops a new learning methodology and systematic approach in both a simulated and a smaller real world environment by integrating supervised imitation learning into reinforcement learning to make the RL training data collection process more effective and efficient. By combining the two methods, the proposed research successfully leverages the advantages of both RL and IL methods. First, a real mini-scale robot car was assembled and trained on a 6 feet by 9 feet real world track using imitation learning. During the process, a handle controller was used to control the mini-scale robot car to drive on the track by imitating a human expert driver and manually recorded the actions using Microsoft AirSim's API. 331 accurate human-like reward training samples were able to be generated and collected. Then, an agent was trained in the Microsoft AirSim simulator using reinforcement learning for 6 hours with the initial 331 reward data inputted from imitation learning training. After a 6-hour training period, the mini-scale robot car was able to successfully drive full laps around the 6 feet by 9 feet track autonomously while the mini-scale robot car was unable to complete one full lap round the track even after 30 hour training pure RL training. With 80% less training time, the new methodology produced significantly more average rewards per hour. Thus, the new methodology was able to save a significant amount of training time and can be used to accelerate the adoption of RL in autonomous driving, which would help produce more efficient and better results in the long run when applied to real life scenarios.</span></div></div>

Using 3D datasets instead of 2D traditional images improves the visualization of anatomical structures, and volume visualization helps radiologists and surgeons to review large datasets comprehensively so that diagnosis and treatment can be enhanced. In liver surgery, blood vessel detection is important. Liver vessels have various shapes and due to the presence of noise in the ultrasound images, they can be confused with noise. Suboptimal images can sometimes lead to surgical errors where the surgeon may cut the blood vessel in error. The ultrasound system is versatile and portable and has the advantage of being able to be used in the operating theatre. Due to the nature of B-mode ultrasound, 1-D transfer function volume visualization of images cannot abrogate shadow artifacts. While multi-dimensional transfer function improves the ability to define features of interest, the high dimensionality in the parameter domain renders it unwieldy and difficult for clinicians to work with. To overcome these limitations, an algorithm for volume visualization that can provide effective 3D visualization of noisy B-mode ultrasound images, which can be useful for clinicians, is proposed. We propose a method that is appropriate for liver ultrasound images focusing on vessels and tumors (if present) in order to delineate their structure and positions clearly to preempt surgical error during operation. This method can prevent possible errors during liver surgery by providing more detailed high quality 3D images for clinicians</span></div></div>

Using the concept of “multiple intelligences” rather than a single type of intelligence, we categorize and provide working definitions of various AGI depending on their cognitive skills or capacities. Future AI systems will be able not only to communicate with human users and each other, but also to efficiently exchange knowledge and wisdom with abilities of cooperation, collaboration and even co-creating something new and valuable and have meta-learning capacities. Multi-agent systems such as these can be used to solve problems that would be difficult to solve by any individual intelligent agent</span></div></div>

The applicability of all methods are discussed, where we provide insights on both some of their benefits and pitfalls. This article ends with our conclusion on which method is better for our WIFI data. Time series data is generated in practically every discipline, and it comes in countless forms. This means that analyzing time series data is important, and potential new approaches that can be developed and used to extract information from them can lead to recognizing important new patterns and possibly to lead to new insights and discoveries. In this article, novel Least Squares techniques that are "data driven" are presented. The approaches presented provide a powerful framework that allows polynomial regression, and differentiation, of virtually any set of data points, including time series and streaming data. We also present a different point of view on the problem and propose improvements to previous algorithms. To develop the derivative approximations we implement a degree finder that allows us to create low error approximations. Finally, we apply our methods to a real-world WIFI data set and find that our approach based on SSA is the best result</span></div></div>

As is believed usually, a new particle suits the conditions that the ratio of the width to the mass is less than 1−3% and a narrow width approximation (NWA) is applicable to identify such type resonant peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the collision products. In the present paper, in the framework of generalized Yukawa model, we find out the properties of the searched particle when its width is larger than a maximal one expected during experiments and so this state could be confused with a noise. We also ascertain the values of particle’s parameters when the NWA is not applicable and estimate the width value when it happens. These estimations are relevant to interactions between the Standard model and dark matter particles. Such approach is focused on the role of couplings and mass values introduced in the model describing interaction of visible and dark matter</span></div></div>

The operators appearing in the system equations are fractional powers A2r and B2σ (in the spectral sense) of general linear operators A and B, which are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and monotone in the Hilbert space L 2 (Ω), for some bounded and smooth domain Ω ⊂ R 3 , and have compact resolvents. Existence, uniqueness, and regularity results have been proved in the quoted paper. Here, in the case of the viscous system, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution as the parameter σ appearing in the operator B2σ decreasingly tends to zero.

In the case of a logarithmic potential, we need to prove an ad hoc strict separation property, and for this reason we have to restrict ourselves to the case d=2.

In Bangladesh, where bureaucracy and legislature operate with little effective accountability or checks and balances, traditional horizontal or vertical accountability proved to be very blunt and weak. In the presence of such faulty mechanisms, ordinary citizens access to information is frequently denied, and their voices are kept mute. It impasses the formation of an enabling environment, where activists and civil society institutions representing the ordinary peoples interest are actively discouraged. They become vulnerable to retribution. Social accountability, on the other hand, provides an enabling environment for activists and civil society institutions to operate freely. Thus, leaders and administration become more accountable to people. An enabling environment means providing legal protection, enhancing the availability of information and increasing citizen voice, strengthening institutional and public service capacities and directing incentives that foster accountability. Donors allocate significant shares of resources to encouraging civil society to partner with elites rather than holding them accountable. This paper advocate for a stronger legal environment to protect critical civil society and whistle-blowers, and for independent grant-makers tasked with building strong, self-regulating social accountability institutions.</span></div></div>

Photon post release reflection from a plane mirror is considered. The changing shape of the form during reflection contains moving discontinuities in electric and magnetic components of the pulse.

However, annotations of large scale datasets in FER has been a key challenge as these datasets suffer from noise due to various factors like crowd sourcing, subjectivity of annotators, poor quality of images, automatic labelling based on key word search etc. Such noisy annotations impede the performance of FER due to the memorization ability of deep networks. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This report presents Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework used in our submission to expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) 2021 competition. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage. Co-training reduces overall error, and consistency loss prevents overfitting to noisy samples. The performance of the model is validated on challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset for categorical expression classification. Our code is made publicly available1</span></div></div>

This linear dynamical system is said to be asymptotically stable if all of the eigenvalues of A lie in the open left-half of the complex plane. In this case, the matrix A is said to be Hurwitz stable or shortly a stable matrix. In practice, stability of a system can be violated because of arbitrarily small perturbations such as modeling errors. In such cases, one deals with the robust stability of the system rather than its stability. The system above is said to be robustly stable if the system, as well as all of its arbitrarily small perturbations, are stable. To measure the robustness of the system subject to perturbations, a quantity of interest is the stability radius or in other words distance to instability. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the structured real stability radius for large-scale systems. We propose a subspace framework to estimate the structured real stability radius and prove that our new method converges at a quadratic rate in theory. Our method benefits from a onesided interpolatory model order reduction technique, in a sense that the left and the right subspaces are the same. The quadratic convergence of the method is due to the certain Hermite interpolation properties between the full and reduced problems. The proposed framework estimate the structured real stability radius for large-scale systems efficiently. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several numerical experiments.</span></div></div>

The system of Euler equations for dynamics of torus rotation is explored in regard to the existence of an analytic way of presentation for the approximated solution (where we consider the case of laminar flow at slow regime of torus rotation). The second finding is associated with the fact that the Stokes boundary layer phenomenon on the boundaries of the torus is also been assumed at formulation of basic Kelvin&amp;Kirchhoff equations (for which analytical expressions for the components of fluid torque vector {T_2, T_3} were obtained earlier). The results of calculations for the components of angular velocity should then be used for full solving the momentum equation of Kelvin&amp;Kirchhoff system.

DTRs are motivated to address the unique and changing needs of individuals by delivering the type of treatment needed, when needed, while minimizing unnecessary treatment. Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision rules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available information about the individual's status and progress should be used in practice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver. The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental design widely used to empirically inform the development of DTRs. Sample size planning resources for SMARTs have been developed for continuous, binary, and survival outcomes. However, an important gap exists in sample size estimation methodology for SMARTs with longitudinal count outcomes. Further, in many health domains, count data are overdispersed - having variance greater than their mean. We propose a Monte Carlo-based approach to sample size estimation applicable to many types of longitudinal outcomes and provide a case study with longitudinal overdispersed count outcomes.

Available hardware restricts the Hamiltonians to be of a structure that allows only pairwise interactions, an aspect that will likely remain for the foreseeable future. This requires that the original optimization problem to be first converted – from its polynomial form – to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which we frame as a problem in algebraic geometry. Additionally, the hardware graph where such a QUBO-Hamiltonian needs to be embedded – assigning variables of the problem to the qubits of the physical optimizer – is not a complete graph, but rather one with limited connectivity. This “problem graph to hardware graph” embedding can also be framed as a problem of computing a Groebner basis of a certain specially constructed polynomial ideal. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational approach to prepare a given polynomial optimization problem for AQC in three steps. The first step reduces an input polynomial optimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner basis of a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function. The second step computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian associated to a given embedding. These steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial optimization problem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure that can be used directly as a translator to solve polynomial integer optimization. Alternatively, it can be used as a test-bed (with small size problems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum compilers by studying various choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive manner. An added benefit of our framework is in designing Ising architectures through the study of Y−minor universal graphs.</span></div></div>

The proposed algorithm is based on mathematical tree subject and improves performance and speed of search by iteratively removing parts of the search space having low fitness, in order to minimize and purify the search space. The experimental results on several well-known benchmarks show the outperforming performance of TBO algorithm in finding the global solution. Experiments on high dimensional search spaces show significantly better performance when using the TBO algorithm.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently suffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be tightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous advection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has recently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the gas’ radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the traditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the disk’s viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of orbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have performed 2D (r, θ) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded in locally isothermal α-disks in steadystate accretion, with various values of α. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to diminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the migration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk’s viscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We show that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions. From these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a giant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while the gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus limiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk’s viscosity. Hence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration should still be very slow.</span></div></div>

We find that the magnetic moments and the g-factors do show a particle number independent behavior in multi-j configura- tions, as expected in the seniority scheme. The calculated results explain the experimental trends quite well. We find that the g-factors of all the seniority states arising from a given multi-j configuration for identical nucleons is equal to the g-factor of the seniority v = 1 state from that configuration. Also, the g-factors are found to be a sensitive probe for fixing the multi-j configuration, which are fully consistent with the configurations assigned to explain the B(EL) properties in our previous works.

The operators appearing in the system equations are fractional versions in the spectral sense of general linear operators A, B having compact resolvents, which are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and monotone in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain. In this work we complement the results given in the quoted paper by studying a distributed control problem for this evolu- tionary system. The main difficulty in the analysis is to establish a rigorous Fr ́echet differentiability result for the associated control-to-state mapping. This seems only to be possible if the state stays bounded, which, in turn, makes it necessary to postulate an additional global boundedness assumption. One typical situation, in which this assumption is satisfied, arises when B is the negative Laplacian with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and the nonlinearity is smooth with polynomial growth of at most order four. Also a case with logarithmic nonlinearity can be handled. Under the global boundedness assumption, we establish existence and first-order necessary optimality conditions for the optimal control problem in terms of a variational inequality and the associated adjoint state system.</span></div></div>

Methods: The two fully convolutional network architectures U-Net and V-Net were trained, evalu- ated and compared on the water-fat MRI data. Data of the study Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold cross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks was determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the multicenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity (BetaJudo), which involved a different study population and scanning device. Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both cross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average dice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute quantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the multi-center test data, the U-Net performs only slightly worse, with average dice scores of 0.970 (VAT) and 0.987 (SAT) and quantification errors of 2.80% (VAT) and 1.65% (SAT). Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable quantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated measurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale stud- ies with minimal need for human intervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore shows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient demographics and imaging centers, as long as a consistent imaging protocol is used.</span></div></div>

Pontogammarus Maeoticus, also called Gammarus in short, is a tiny creature found mostly in coast of Caspian Sea in Iran. In this algorithm, global optima is modeled as sea edge (coast) to which Gammarus creatures are willing to move in order to rest from sea waves and forage in sand. Sea waves satisfy exploration and foraging models exploitation. The strength of sea wave is determined according to distance of Gammarus from sea edge. The angles of waves applied on several particles are set randomly helping algorithm not be stuck in local bests. Meanwhile, the neighborhood of particles change adaptively resulting in more efficient progress in searching. The proposed algorithm, although is applicable on any optimization problem, is experimented for partially shaded solar PV array. Experiments on CEC05 benchmarks, as well as solar PV array, show the effectiveness of this optimization algorithm.</span></div></div>

Our definition of the fractional powers of operators uses the approach via spectral theory. A nonlinearity of double-well type occurs in the phase equation and either a regular or logarithmic potential, as well as a non-differentiable potential involving an indicator function, is admitted in our approach. We show general well-posedness and regularity results, extending the corresponding results that are known for the non-fractional elliptic operators with zero Neumann conditions or other boundary conditions like Dirichlet or Robin ones. Then, we investigate the longtime behavior of the system, by fully characterizing every element of the ω-limit as a stationary solution. In the final part of the paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the system a as the parameter σ appearing in the operator B2σ that plays in the phase equation decreasingly tends to zero.
