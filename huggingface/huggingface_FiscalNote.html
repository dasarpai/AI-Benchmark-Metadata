SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The people of the United States consider the national \n        and international protection and promotion of human rights and \n        the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The \n        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill \n        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and \n        protection in the Constitution.\n            (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents \n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are \n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \n        citizens of the United States.\n            (3) The United States will continue to receive requests \n        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human \n        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. \n        In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish \n        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the \n        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. \n        Currently, the United States responds to declassification \n        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential \n        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of \n        the United States in the protection and promotion of human \n        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant \n        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, \n        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').\n            (4) The expedient declassification of human rights \n        documents in full compliance with United States security \n        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will \n        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law \n        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of \n        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of \n        Government resources.\n            (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \n        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States \n        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military \n        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, \n        consistent with the national interests and international \n        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless \n        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and \n        citizens of the United States promote human rights and \n        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if \n        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken \n        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed \n        United States engagements in those areas remains.\n            (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \n        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a \n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.\n            (7) The United States has long provided international \n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\n            (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against \n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one \nanother the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \nproceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or \ncomplicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at \ntheir disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a \nmember State of the Organization of American States, the United States \nshould seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the \nInter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the \nOrganization of American States adopt legislative and such other \nmeasures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to \ninformation in files and documents in the power of the State, \nparticularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal \nresponsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human \nrights.''\n            (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \n        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and \n        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission \n        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and \n        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \n        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \n        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, \n        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human \n        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the \n        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification \n        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal \n        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan \n        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, \n        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the \n        relatives.''\n            (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, \n        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery \n        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the \n        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.\n            (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, \n        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I \n        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence \n        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the \n        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] \n        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. \n        We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace \n        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''\n            (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting \n        documentation of the United States on human rights violations \n        in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \n        has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \n        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \n        United States Government containing information about gross \n        violations of internationally recognized human rights committed \n        after 1944.\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \n        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \n        policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, \n        the Department of State, the Agency for International \n        Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its \n        components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \n        Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of \n        its components), the National Security Council, and the \n        Executive Office of the President.\n            (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human \n        rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally \n        recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in \n        section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n        U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).\n\nSEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS \n              RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nprovisions of this Act shall govern the declassification and public \ndisclosure of human rights records by agencies.\n    (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and \norganize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in \nGuatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and \ndisclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, \nall records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available \nto the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section \nis completed.\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding \neach agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a \nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \nonly if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing \nevidence that--\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \n        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \n        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \n        such public disclosure would reveal--\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently \n                requires protection;\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \n                        Government;\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \n                        disclosed; and\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \n                        activities; or\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \n                of foreign relations of the United States, the \n                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the \n                national security of the \n                United States;\n            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided \n        confidential information to the United States and would pose a \n        substantial risk of harm to that individual;\n            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\n            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \n        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a \n        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public \n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \n        interest.\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \nrelationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection \n(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an \n``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\n\nSEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN \n              OTHER COUNTRIES.\n\n    In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request \nfor human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations, \nthe Organization of American States or a similar entity, a national \ntruth commission or entity of similar nature, or from the principal \njustice or human rights official of a country that is investigating a \npattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, \nthe agency shall conduct a review of records as described in section 4 \nand shall declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance \nwith the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.\n\nSEC. 7.

LEASES OF RESTRICTED LANDS FOR THE NAVAJO NATION.\n\n    Subsection (e)(1) of the first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 \n(25 U.S.C. 415(e)(1); commonly referred to as the ``Long-Term Leasing \nAct''), is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``, except a lease for'' and inserting ``, \n        including leases for'';\n            (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``25'' the first place \n        it appears and all that follows and inserting ``99 years;'';\n            (3) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n        inserting ``; and''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(C) in the case of a lease for the exploration, \n        development, or extraction of mineral resources, including \n        geothermal resources, 25 years, except that any such lease may \n        include an option to renew for one additional term not to \n        exceed 25 years.''.\n\nSEC. 11. NONAPPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN RULES.\n\n    No rule promulgated by the Department of the Interior regarding \nhydraulic fracturing used in the development or production of oil or \ngas resources shall have any effect on any land held in trust or \nrestricted status for the benefit of Indians except with the express \nconsent of the beneficiary on whose behalf such land is held in trust \nor restricted status.&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Native American Energy Act - (Sec. 3) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allow the Secretary of the Interior, an affected Indian tribe, or a certified third-party appraiser under contract with the Indian tribe to appraise Indian land or trust assets involved in a transaction requiring the Secretary's approval.  Deems an appraisal that is conducted by an Indian tribe or by an appraiser under contract with an Indian tribe to be approved if the Secretary does not approve or disapprove of the appraisal within 60 days of receiving it. Gives tribes the option of waiving such appraisals if they give the Secretary an unambiguous indication of tribal intent to do so that includes an express waiver of any claims they might have against the United States that result from forgoing the appraisal. (Sec. 4) Requires each agency within the Department of the Interior involved in the review of oil and gas activities on Indian lands to use a uniform system of reference numbers and tracking systems for oil and gas wells. (Sec. 5) Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to make the environmental impact statement for major federal action on Indian lands available for review and comment only to the affected Indian tribe and individuals residing within the affected area. (Sec. 6) Prohibits the Secretary from collecting a fee for: (1) applying for a permit to drill on Indian land, (2) oil or gas inspection activities on such lands, or (3) any oil or gas lease for nonproducing acreage on Indian land. (Sec. 7) Requires plaintiffs who obtain a preliminary injunction or administrative stay in Indian energy related actions to post bond. (Indian energy related actions are those concerned with energy activities undertaken on Indian land or by Indian tribes on other lands.)  Subjects plaintiffs to liability for a defendant's harm should they not ultimately prevail on the merits of the energy related action. Prohibits plaintiffs in Indian energy related actions against the federal government from receiving certain federal payments for their fees or expenses. (Sec. 8) Amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to direct the Secretary to enter into agreements with Indian tribes, from FY2014-FY2018, to carry out demonstration projects that promote biomass energy production on Indian forest land and in nearby communities by providing tribes with reliable supplies of woody biomass from federal lands. Requires the creation of at least four new demonstration projects during each of those fiscal years. Directs the Secretary, when reviewing project applications, to consider whether a proposed demonstration project will:  increase the availability or reliability of local or regional energy, enhance the tribe's economic development, improve the connection of electric power transmission facilities serving the tribe with other electric transmission facilities, improve the forest health or watersheds of federal land or Indian forest land or rangeland, or  otherwise promote woody biomass use.  Directs the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to incorporate management plans in effect on Indian forest land or rangeland into demonstration project agreements affecting those lands. Prohibits the agreements from having a term that exceeds 20 years, but allows them to be renewed for up to ten additional years. (Sec. 9) Considers activities conducted or resources harvested or produced pursuant to a tribal resource management plan or an integrated resource management plan approved by the Secretary to be a sustainable management practice when sustainability is federally required. (Sec. 10) Amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to authorize the Navajo Nation to enter into commercial or agricultural leases of up to 99 years on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval, provided they are executed under tribal regulations approved by the Secretary.  Allows the Navajo Nation to enter into mineral resource leases on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval if they are executed under approved tribal regulations and do not exceed 25 years, though they may include a renewal option for one additional term not exceeding 25 years. (Sec. 11) Prohibits any Department of the Interior rule regarding hydraulic fracturing, used in oil and gas development or production, from having any effect on land held in trust or restricted status for Indians, except with the express consent of its Indian beneficiaries.  &quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Native American Energy Act&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief \nAct of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 \n        European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and \n        communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one \n        of the most tragic crimes in modern history.\n            (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \n        many were rejected because the claimants did not have death \n        certificates or physical possession of policy documents that \n        had been confiscated by the Nazis.\n            (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the \n        only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging to \n        Holocaust victims.\n            (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been \n        fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to settle \n        unpaid insurance claims.\n            (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \n        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \n        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \n        insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of \n        international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, to \n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \n        issued to Holocaust victims.\n            (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that were \n        not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.\n            (7) The ICHEIC's deadline for receiving claims applications \n        is January 31, 2002.\n            (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of \n        unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold \n        thousands of names on dormant accounts.\n            (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 \n        claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle because \n        the claimants could not identify the company holding the \n        policy.\n            (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United \n        States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of \n        insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their \n        related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid \n        resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to \n        eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and their \n        families.\n            (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, \n        Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in \n        efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of insurers \n        to engage in business transactions in those States until the \n        insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era policyholders.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide information \nabout Holocaust-era insurance policies to Holocaust victims and their \nheirs and beneficiaries to enable them to expeditiously file their \nrightful claims under the policies.\n\nSEC. 3. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY.\n\n    (a) Establishment and Maintenance.--Chapter 21 of title 44, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 2119.

Allows an agency head to waive or delay the completion of some or all of such requirements to the same extent such agency head may waive or delay completion of requirements for initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses.Requires the head of an agency promulgating a rule that may have a significant privacy impact on individuals or on a substantial number of individuals to use specified techniques to assure that individuals have been given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking.Requires each agency to: (1) carry out a periodic review of promulgated rules that have such impact to determine whether each such rule can be amended or rescinded in a manner that minimizes such impact while remaining in accordance with applicable statutes; (2) carry out such review in accordance with a plan that provides for the review of each rule every ten years after the rule was published as a final rule; and (3) publish annually a list of the rules to be reviewed.Sets forth provisions governing judicial review of agency compliance with this Act.Requires submission of an agency's actions under this Act for congressional review.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To amend title 5, United States Code, to require that agencies, in promulgating rules, take into consideration the impact of such rules on the privacy of individuals, and for other purposes.&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:18949,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODg3OSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0Zpc2NhbE5vdGUvYmlsbHN1bSIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyMjQ3OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.C8RvUqQtEg6yP4Uuxq1SuW1Qauk3YrAo1T8W0QLC4EVQxBST-NSfuhKJzn6YTdP59YCoN7ooWWH2q6rjAyusBQ&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;FiscalNote/billsum&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1673649342093-63c1dc60726f62e411fa4b26.png&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;FiscalNote&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FiscalNote&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:14},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The people of the United States consider the national 
        and international protection and promotion of human rights and 
        the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The 
        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill 
        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and 
        protection in the Constitution.
            (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents 
        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are 
        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and 
        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic 
        gross human rights violations, including those directed against 
        citizens of the United States.
            (3) The United States will continue to receive requests 
        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human 
        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. 
        In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish 
        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the 
        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. 
        Currently, the United States responds to declassification 
        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential 
        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of 
        the United States in the protection and promotion of human 
        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant 
        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, 
        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').
            (4) The expedient declassification of human rights 
        documents in full compliance with United States security 
        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will 
        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law 
        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of 
        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of 
        Government resources.
            (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human 
        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States 
        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military 
        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, 
        consistent with the national interests and international 
        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless 
        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and 
        citizens of the United States promote human rights and 
        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if 
        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken 
        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed 
        United States engagements in those areas remains.
            (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest 
        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies 
        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human 
        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a 
        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the 
        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national 
        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, 
        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.
            (7) The United States has long provided international 
        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations 
        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing 
        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in 
        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among 
        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former 
        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
            (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against 
        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one 
another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal 
proceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or 
complicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at 
their disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a 
member State of the Organization of American States, the United States 
should seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the 
Organization of American States adopt legislative and such other 
measures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to 
information in files and documents in the power of the State, 
particularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal 
responsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human 
rights.''
            (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of 
        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and 
        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission 
        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and 
        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan 
        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification 
        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, 
        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human 
        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the 
        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification 
        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal 
        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan 
        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, 
        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the 
        relatives.''
            (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, 
        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery 
        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the 
        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.
            (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, 
        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I 
        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence 
        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the 
        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] 
        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. 
        We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace 
        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''
            (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human 
        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting 
        documentation of the United States on human rights violations 
        in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request 
        has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' 
        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the 
        United States Government containing information about gross 
        violations of internationally recognized human rights committed 
        after 1944.
            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the 
        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign 
        policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, 
        the Department of State, the Agency for International 
        Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its 
        components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National 
        Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of 
        its components), the National Security Council, and the 
        Executive Office of the President.
            (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human 
        rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally 
        recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in 
        section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
        U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).

SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
              RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
provisions of this Act shall govern the declassification and public 
disclosure of human rights records by agencies.
    (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and 
organize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in 
Guatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and 
disclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, 
all records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available 
to the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section 
is completed.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding 
each agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.

SEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.

    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a 
human rights record or particular information in a human rights record 
only if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing 
evidence that--
            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence 
        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United 
        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record 
        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and 
        such public disclosure would reveal--
                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently 
                requires protection;
                    (B) an intelligence source or method--
                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably 
                        expected to be utilized, by the United States 
                        Government;
                            (ii) which has not been officially 
                        disclosed; and
                            (iii) the disclosure of which would 
                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence 
                        activities; or
                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the 
                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct 
                of foreign relations of the United States, the 
                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the 
                national security of the 
                United States;
            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would 
        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided 
        confidential information to the United States and would pose a 
        substantial risk of harm to that individual;
            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could 
        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of 
        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so 
        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or
            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would 
        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality 
        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a 
        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public 
        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public 
        interest.
    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be 
grounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an 
individual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset 
of the United States Government, although the existence of such 
relationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection 
(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an 
``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section 
606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).

SEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN 
              OTHER COUNTRIES.

    In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request 
for human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations, 
the Organization of American States or a similar entity, a national 
truth commission or entity of similar nature, or from the principal 
justice or human rights official of a country that is investigating a 
pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, 
the agency shall conduct a review of records as described in section 4 
and shall declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance 
with the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.

SEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS.

    (a) Duties of the Appeals Panel.--The Interagency Security 
Classification Appeals Panel or any other entity subsequently 
established by law or Executive order and charged with carrying out the 
functions currently carried out by such Panel (referred to in this Act 
as the ``Appeals Panel'') shall review all determinations by an agency 
to postpone public disclosure of any human rights record.
    (b) Determinations of the Appeals Panel.--
            (1) In general.--The Appeals Panel shall direct that all 
        human rights records be disclosed to the public, unless the 
        Appeals Panel determines that there is clear and convincing 
        evidence that--
                    (A) the record is not a human rights record; or
                    (B) the human rights record or particular 
                information in the human rights record qualifies for 
                postponement of disclosure pursuant to section 5.
            (2) Treatment in cases of nondisclosure.--If the Appeals 
        Panel concurs with an agency decision to postpone disclosure of 
        a human rights record, the Appeals Panel shall determine, in 
        consultation with the originating agency and consistent with 
the standards set forth in this Act, which, if any, of the alternative 
forms of disclosure described in paragraph (3) shall be made by the 
agency.
            (3) Alternative forms of disclosure.--The forms of 
        disclosure described in this paragraph are as follows:
                    (A) Disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion 
                of the human rights record after deletion of the 
                portions described in paragraph (1).
                    (B) Disclosure of a record that is a substitute for 
                information which is not disclosed.
                    (C) Disclosure of a summary of the information 
                contained in the human rights record.
            (4) Notification of determination.--
                    (A) In general.--Upon completion of its review, the 
                Appeals Panel shall notify the head of the agency in 
                control or possession of the human rights record that 
                was the subject of the review of its determination and 
                shall, not later than 14 days after the determination, 
                publish the determination in the Federal Register.
                    (B) Notice to president.--The Appeals Panel shall 
                notify the President of its determination. The notice 
                shall contain a written unclassified justification for 
                its determination, including an explanation of the 
                application of the standards contained in section 5.
            (5) General procedures.--The Appeals Panel shall publish in 
        the Federal Register guidelines regarding its policy and 
        procedures for adjudicating appeals.
    (c) Presidential Authority Over Appeals Panel Determination.--
            (1) Public disclosure or postponement of disclosure.--The 
        President shall have the sole and nondelegable authority to 
        review any determination of the Appeals Panel under this Act, 
        and such review shall be based on the standards set forth in 
        section 5. Not later than 30 days after the Appeals Panel's 
        determination and notification to the agency pursuant to 
        subsection (b)(4), the President shall provide the Appeals 
        Panel with an unclassified written certification specifying the 
        President's decision and stating the reasons for the decision, 
        including in the case of a determination to postpone 
        disclosure, the standards set forth in section 5 which are the 
        basis for the President's determination.
            (2) Record of presidential postponement.--The Appeals Panel 
        shall, upon receipt of the President's determination, publish 
        in the Federal Register a copy of any unclassified written 
        certification, statement, and other materials transmitted by or 
        on behalf of the President with regard to the postponement of 
        disclosure of a human rights record.

SEC. 8. REPORT REGARDING OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS.

    Upon completion of the review and disclosure of the human rights 
records relating to Guatemala and Honduras, the Information Security 
Policy Advisory Council, established pursuant to Executive Order No. 
12958, shall report to Congress on the desirability and feasibility of 
declassification of human rights records relating to other countries. 
The report shall be available to the public.

SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

    (a) Freedom of Information Act.--Nothing in this Act shall be

who have demonstrated substantial human rights expertise and who are 
able to meet the security requirements for the positions. The President 
shall seek recommendations with respect to such positions from 
nongovernmental human rights organizations.</span></div></div>

        action'' means a cause of action that--
                    (A) is filed on or after the effective date of this 
                Act; and
                    (B) seeks judicial review of a final agency action 
                (as defined in section 702 of title 5, United States 
                Code), to issue a permit, license, or other form of 
                agency permission allowing:
                            (i) any person or entity to conduct 
                        activities on Indian Land, which activities 
                        involve the exploration, development,

SEC. 10. LEASES OF RESTRICTED LANDS FOR THE NAVAJO NATION.

    Subsection (e)(1) of the first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 
(25 U.S.C. 415(e)(1); commonly referred to as the ``Long-Term Leasing 
Act''), is amended--

        including leases for'';
            (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``25'' the first place 
        it appears and all that follows and inserting ``99 years;'';

consent of the beneficiary on whose behalf such land is held in trust 
or restricted status.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Native American Energy Act - (Sec. 3) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allow the Secretary of the Interior, an affected Indian tribe, or a certified third-party appraiser under contract with the Indian tribe to appraise Indian land or trust assets involved in a transaction requiring the Secretary's approval.  Deems an appraisal that is conducted by an Indian tribe or by an appraiser under contract with an Indian tribe to be approved if the Secretary does not approve or disapprove of the appraisal within 60 days of receiving it. Gives tribes the option of waiving such appraisals if they give the Secretary an unambiguous indication of tribal intent to do so that includes an express waiver of any claims they might have against the United States that result from forgoing the appraisal. (Sec. 4) Requires each agency within the Department of the Interior involved in the review of oil and gas activities on Indian lands to use a uniform system of reference numbers and tracking systems for oil and gas wells. (Sec. 5) Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to make the environmental impact statement for major federal action on Indian lands available for review and comment only to the affected Indian tribe and individuals residing within the affected area. (Sec. 6) Prohibits the Secretary from collecting a fee for: (1) applying for a permit to drill on Indian land, (2) oil or gas inspection activities on such lands, or (3) any oil or gas lease for nonproducing acreage on Indian land. (Sec. 7) Requires plaintiffs who obtain a preliminary injunction or administrative stay in Indian energy related actions to post bond. (Indian energy related actions are those concerned with energy activities undertaken on Indian land or by Indian tribes on other lands.)  Subjects plaintiffs to liability for a defendant's harm should they not ultimately prevail on the merits of the energy related action. Prohibits plaintiffs in Indian energy related actions against the federal government from receiving certain federal payments for their fees or expenses. (Sec. 8) Amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to direct the Secretary to enter into agreements with Indian tribes, from FY2014-FY2018, to carry out demonstration projects that promote biomass energy production on Indian forest land and in nearby communities by providing tribes with reliable supplies of woody biomass from federal lands. Requires the creation of at least four new demonstration projects during each of those fiscal years. Directs the Secretary, when reviewing project applications, to consider whether a proposed demonstration project will:  increase the availability or reliability of local or regional energy, enhance the tribe's economic development, improve the connection of electric power transmission facilities serving the tribe with other electric transmission facilities, improve the forest health or watersheds of federal land or Indian forest land or rangeland, or  otherwise promote woody biomass use.  Directs the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to incorporate management plans in effect on Indian forest land or rangeland into demonstration project agreements affecting those lands. Prohibits the agreements from having a term that exceeds 20 years, but allows them to be renewed for up to ten additional years. (Sec. 9) Considers activities conducted or resources harvested or produced pursuant to a tribal resource management plan or an integrated resource management plan approved by the Secretary to be a sustainable management practice when sustainability is federally required. (Sec. 10) Amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to authorize the Navajo Nation to enter into commercial or agricultural leases of up to 99 years on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval, provided they are executed under tribal regulations approved by the Secretary.  Allows the Navajo Nation to enter into mineral resource leases on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval if they are executed under approved tribal regulations and do not exceed 25 years, though they may include a renewal option for one additional term not exceeding 25 years. (Sec. 11) Prohibits any Department of the Interior rule regarding hydraulic fracturing, used in oil and gas development or production, from having any effect on land held in trust or restricted status for Indians, except with the express consent of its Indian beneficiaries.  </span></div></div>

SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief 
Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 
        European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and 
        communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one 
        of the most tragic crimes in modern history.
            (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims 
        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, 
        many were rejected because the claimants did not have death 
        certificates or physical possession of policy documents that 
        had been confiscated by the Nazis.
            (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the 
        only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging to 
        Holocaust victims.
            (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been 
        fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to settle 
        unpaid insurance claims.
            (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era 
        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the 
        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of 
        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European 
        insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of 
        international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, to 
        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies 
        issued to Holocaust victims.
            (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed 
        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation 
        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which 
        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that were 
        not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.
            (7) The ICHEIC's deadline for receiving claims applications 
        is January 31, 2002.
            (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of 
        unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold 
        thousands of names on dormant accounts.
            (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 
        claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle because 
        the claimants could not identify the company holding the 
        policy.
            (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United 
        States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of 
        insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their 
        related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid 
        resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to 
        eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and their 
        families.
            (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, 
        Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in 
        efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of insurers 
        to engage in business transactions in those States until the 
        insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era policyholders.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide information 
about Holocaust-era insurance policies to Holocaust victims and their 
heirs and beneficiaries to enable them to expeditiously file their 
rightful claims under the policies.

        insurer or a related company of the insurer.
            (2) The name of the entity that issued the covered policy.
            (3) The name of the entity that is responsible for the

is liable under section 6.

SEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES.

    (a) Preemption.--Nothing in this Act preempts the right of any 
State to adopt or enforce any State law requiring an insurer to 
disclose information regarding insurance policies that may have been 
confiscated or stolen from victims of Nazi persecution.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that if any 
litigation challenging any State law described in subsection (a) is 
dismissed because the State's commissioner of insurance chooses to rely 
on this Act and therefore no longer seeks to enforce the State law, 
each party should bear its own legal fees and costs.

SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS.

    (a) In General.--Subpart 14 of title V of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7269 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by inserting after the subpart heading the following:

   ``CHAPTER A--SYSTEMS INTEGRATION; PROMOTION OF SCHOOL READINESS'';

        and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

 ``CHAPTER B--SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS

``SEC. 5545. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has 
        found that although 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer 
        from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of 
        impairment, in any given year fewer than 1 in 5 of these 
        children receives needed treatment. The short- and long-term 
        consequences of untreated childhood mental disorders are 
        costly, in both human and fiscal terms.
            ``(2) School counselors, school social workers, and school 
        psychologists are needed to help these children and to provide 
        a variety of crucial support services.
            ``(3) Across the United States, there are insufficient 
        resources for school-based counseling professionals, and often 
        students do not get the help they need. The current national 
        average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary 
        and secondary schools is 561 to 1.
            ``(4) United States schools need more mental health 
        professionals, and they need the flexibility to hire the 
        professionals that will best serve their students.
            ``(5) According to the Institute of Medicine of the 
        National Academy of Sciences, the maximum recommended ratio 
        of--
                    ``(A) students to school counselors is 250 to 1;
                    ``(B) students to school psychologists is 1,000 to 
                1; and
                    ``(C) students to school social workers is 800 to 
                1.
            ``(6) In some States, 1 school counselor typically serves 
        over 1,000 students. Ratios for school psychologists and school 
        social workers are also extremely high. In some schools, no 
        school-based mental health and student service provider is 
        available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any 
        other time.
            ``(7) The number of students is expected to grow 
        significantly over the next few years. During this time, many 
        school-based mental health professionals who currently serve 
        the Nation's youth will retire.
            ``(8) Model programs using school-based mental health and 
        student service providers have reduced school suspensions, 
        reduced referrals to the principal's office, reduced the use of 
        weapons, force, and threats, and increased students' feelings 
        of safety.

``SEC. 5546. PURPOSES.

    ``The purposes of this chapter are to assist States and local 
educational agencies in hiring additional school-based mental health 
providers, including additional school counselors, school 
psychologists, and school social workers to achieve each of the 
following:
            ``(1) To reduce the ratios of school-based mental health 
        and student service providers to students in elementary and 
        secondary schools in the United States to the following minimum 
        ratios recommended by the Institute of Medicine of the National 
        Academy of Sciences in its 1997 report `Schools and Health: Our 
        Nation's Investment':
                    ``(A) 1 school counselor for every 250 students;
                    ``(B) 1 school psychologist for every 1,000 
                students; and
                    ``(C) 1 school social worker for every 800 
                students.
            ``(2) To provide school-based mental health and student 
        services.
            ``(3) To remove emotional, behavioral, and psychosocial 
        barriers to learning so as to enhance students classroom 
        preparedness and ability to learn.
            ``(4) To support school staff and teachers in improving 
        classroom management, conducting behavioral interventions to 
        improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and 
        skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need 
        for mental health services.
            ``(5) To support parental involvement in improving the 
        school behavior and academic success of their children.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States and the Indian tribes have a unique 
        legal and political government-to-government relationship;
            (2) pursuant to the Constitution, treaties, statutes, 
        Executive orders, court decisions, and course of conduct, the 
        United States has a trust obligation to provide certain 
        services to Indian tribes and to Indians;
            (3) Federal departments and agencies charged with 
        administering programs and providing services to, or for the 
        benefit of, Indians have not furnished Congress with adequate 
        information necessary to assess such programs on the needs of 
        Indians and Indian tribes;
            (4) such lack of information has hampered the ability of 
        Congress to determine the nature, type, and magnitude of such 
        needs as well as its ability to respond to them; and
            (5) Congress cannot properly fulfill its obligation to 
        Indian tribes and Indian people unless and until it has an 
        adequate store of information related to the needs of Indians 
        nationwide.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) ensure that Indian needs for Federal programs and 
        services are known in a more certain and predictable fashion;
            (2) require that Federal departments and agencies carefully 
        review and monitor the effectiveness of the programs and 
        services provided to Indians;
            (3) provide for more efficient and effective cooperation 
        and coordination of, and accountability from, the Federal 
        departments and agencies providing programs and services, 
        including technical and business development assistance, to 
        Indians; and
            (4) provide Congress with reliable information regarding 
        Indian needs and the evaluation of Federal programs and 
        services provided to Indians nationwide.

        valuable research information on these complex social concerns, 
        taking into account a wide range of social, medical, economic 
        and community influences from an interdisciplinary, family-

the agency promulgating the rule or the official of the agency with 
statutory responsibility for the promulgation of the rule shall assure 
that individuals have been given an opportunity to participate in the 
rulemaking for the rule through techniques such as--
            ``(1) the inclusion in an advance notice of proposed 
        rulemaking, if issued, of a statement that the proposed rule 
        may have a significant privacy impact on individuals, or a 
        privacy impact on a substantial number of individuals;

        review of the rules promulgated by the agency that have a 
        significant privacy impact on individuals, or a privacy impact 
        on a substantial number of individuals. Under such periodic 
        review, the agency shall determine, for each such rule, whether 
        the rule can be amended or rescinded in a manner that minimizes 
        any such impact while remaining in accordance with applicable 
        statutes. For each such determination, the agency shall 
        consider the following factors:
                    ``(A) The continued need for the rule.
                    ``(B) The nature of complaints or comments received 
                from the public concerning the rule.
                    ``(C) The complexity of the rule.

                governmental rules.

                reviewed under this subsection.

                conditions, or other factors have changed in the area 
                affected by the rule since the rule was last reviewed 
                under this subsection.
            ``(2) Plan required.--Each agency shall carry out the 
        periodic review required by paragraph (1) in accordance with a 
        plan published by such agency in the Federal Register. Each 
        such plan shall provide for the review under this subsection of 
        each rule promulgated by the agency not later than 10 years 
        after the date on which such rule was published as the final 
        rule and, thereafter, not later than 10 years after the date on 
        which such rule was last reviewed under this subsection. The 
        agency may amend such plan at any time by publishing the 
revision in the Federal Register.
            ``(3) Annual publication.--Each year, each agency shall 
        publish in the Federal Register a list of the rules to be 
        reviewed by such agency under this subsection during the 
        following year. The list shall include a brief description of 
        each such rule and the need for and legal basis of such rule 
        and shall invite public comment upon the determination to be 
        made under this subsection with respect to such rule.
    ``(f) Judicial Review.--

        individual who is adversely affected or aggrieved by final 
        agency action is entitled to judicial review of agency 
        compliance with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) in 
        accordance with chapter 7. Agency compliance with subsection 
        (d) shall be judicially reviewable in connection with judicial 
        review of subsection (b).

                period beginning on the date of final agency action and 
                ending 1 year later, except that where a provision of 
                law requires that an action challenging a final agency 
                action be commenced before the expiration of 1 year, 
                such lesser period shall apply to an action for

                        made available to the public; or
                            ``(ii) where a provision of law requires 
                        that an action challenging a final agency 
                        regulation be commenced before the expiration 
                        of the 1-year period, the number of days 
                        specified in such provision of law that  is 
after the date the analysis is made available to the public.
            ``(4) Relief.--In granting any relief in an action under 
        this subsection, the court shall order the agency to take 
        corrective action consistent with this section and chapter 7,

                    ``(A) remanding the rule to the agency; and
                    ``(B) deferring the enforcement of the rule against 
                individuals, unless the court finds that continued 
                enforcement of the rule is in the public interest.
            ``(5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to limit the authority of any court to stay 
        the effective date of any rule or provision thereof under any 
        other provision of law or to grant any other relief in addition 
        to the requirements of this subsection.
            ``(6) Record of agency action.--In an action for the 
        judicial review of a rule, the privacy impact analysis for such 
        rule, including an analysis prepared or corrected pursuant to 
        paragraph (4), shall constitute part of the entire record of 
        agency action in connection with such review.
            ``(7) Exclusivity.--Compliance or noncompliance by an 
        agency with the provisions of this section shall be subject to 
        judicial review only in accordance with this subsection.
            ``(8) Savings clause.--Nothing in this subsection bars 
        judicial review of any other impact statement or similar 
        analysis required by any other law if judicial review of such 
        statement or analysis is otherwise permitted by law.
    ``(g) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`personally identifiable information' means information that can be 
used to identify an individual, including such individual's name, 
address, telephone number, photograph, social security number or other 
identifying information. It includes information about such 
individual's medical or financial condition.''.
    (b) Periodic Review Transition Provisions.--
            (1) Initial plan.--For each agency, the plan required by 
        subsection (e) of section 553a of title 5, United States Code 
        (as added by subsection (a)), shall be published not later than 
        180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) In the case of a rule promulgated by an agency before 
        the date of the enactment of this Act, such plan shall provide 
        for the periodic review of such rule before the expiration of 
        the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of 
        this Act. For any such rule, the head of the agency may provide 
        for a 1-year extension of such period if the head of the 
        agency, before the expiration of the period, certifies in a 
        statement published in the Federal Register that reviewing such 
        rule before the expiration of the period is not feasible. The 
        head of the agency may provide for additional 1-year extensions 
        of the period pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no 
        event may the period exceed 15 years.
    (c) Congressional Review.--Section 801(a)(1)(B) of title 5, United 
States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating clauses (iii) and (iv) as clauses (iv) 
        and (v), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after clause (ii) the following new 
        clause:
            ``(iii) the agency's actions relevant to section 553a;''.
    (d) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after 
the item relating to section 553 the following new item:

``553a. Privacy impact analysis in rulemaking.''.
