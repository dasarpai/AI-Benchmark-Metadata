My apartment is a fucking pigsty, with no exaggeration of the word. I live by myself and my house is beyond messy into dirty, I haven't been able to have anyone over for months. My girlfriend has a few preteen/teen kids and is working two jobs right now, and I spend most of my time at her place. She has very little time to clean, and dishes pile up super fast. Whenever I go over and she's not home, I get the urge to clean to help her out, and feel so much more motivated to do every chore I absolutely hate at my house. She doesn't ask me to, but it feels good being able to help out. I just wish I could get that kind of motivation at my house; instead of the feeling of dread and self hatred.

Pre 6 months ago I was surviving fine on my medication but I feel it only fixes whatever mode my mind is in. The last few months have been pushing my brain to the limit to where my medicine doesn't do much and effectively, my brain is in permanent fog mode. Whilst my medicine works in pushing away inattentiveness it has lead me to become always on and I struggle to thoroughly relax which is slowly frying my brain, more is coming in than going out. \n\nI'm glad the Christmas break is here, I need it. Taking a week off the meds, no work, no study and just allowing my brain to refresh. I think, as an inattentive, we focus on pushing our brains harder to meet the expectations but ignore the necessary maintenance to keep it running. Engines that are worked harder are maintained more often.\n\n(I'm not recommending anyone to stop their medications btw, just to consciously make the effort to give yourself deserved TLC). \n\nTake care&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:13:15.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmb47u&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Using Christmas to take a break&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmb47u/using_christmas_to_take_a_break/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Field-cave1519&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm a newly diagnosed 42 yr old female, who started Adderall about a month ago.  The 5mg I started with quieted things down in my brain a tiny bit but didn't really do much else.  I've gone up to 10mg with a 5mg booster in the afternoon.   About 30 mins after the initial dose, I feel calmer and I'm able to internally narrate my thoughts step by step a bit (which is a bit odd for me, although it may be more \&quot;normal\&quot; than 40000 thoughts circling around) but that's about the only real difference for me.   I also initially felt almost grossly hungover at around 1pm (without taking the  5mg booster) but that seems to have dissipated a bit \n\nI'll discuss with my therapist and then my prescriber in 2 weeks at my next appointment, but I'm wondering if I should be getting more out of it?

Feeling really disheartened, if in a similar boat, what worked for you in the end/do you have any advice?\n\n\n\nSo I've been titrating up on concerta for about two months, currently coming to the end of my 36mg. \n\n- 18mg worked wonders the first day, then slowly went more to the background as time went on, and the benefit was kind of unnoticeable. \n\n- 27mg again felt very calming and focusing on the first day, felt like it was my dose, but then as the two weeks went on I felt incredibly tired, zoned out, couldn't keep my eyes open etc., they worked for my symptoms but otherwise felt awful, like I'd had no sleep. \n\n- 36mg then came along and holy crap, first day I felt extreme anxiety/anger, and I would hyperfocus on thoughts resulting in me taking nothing in people said to me. This did eventually level out as the month went on, and for a little while it felt okay - again it did a lot for my symptoms and focus. But now the anger and strong emotions are slowly creeping back, I'm feeling very spaced out when out of the house, and it's almost a feeling of being so focused to the exclusion of the world around me, but without feeling tired thankfully. I just feel so absent. \n\nThis whole experience has left me feeling really disheartened and like a fake - my psych initially told me he thought I'd end up on a high dose due to my severe symptoms, but I'm reacting to these middling doses awfully. I've told him via my online portal but I haven't heard anything I think due to the leadup to Christmas (fun fact didn't organise my next round in time so will be without anything for the first week of 2022 🙃) and it's just making me worry like crazy I won't find the right med/I'm just faking my condition. \n\nI guess I'm just asking if anyone has had a similar experience and what worked for them in the end. It's hard because I don't think I get regular meetings with Psychiatry UK, so it's difficult to explain my experiences in a succint manner via messages, given how much it's fluctuated, so I think I'd really just appreciate some perspective so I can go into it with suggestions/clarity in mind in order to explain my situation better.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:09:50.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmb1ib&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Xaggatin: zoned out and angry&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmb1ib/xaggatin_zoned_out_and_angry/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:10,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;etyf12&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[removed]&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:09:33.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmb1av&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;i need help&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmb1av/i_need_help/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;terrapin09&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I have ADHD and I highly suspect I have OCD.\n\nI  hear a lot about intrusive thoughts and specific obsessions but for me  that often isn't my experience? Because of my ADHD all my thoughts come  at me at breakneck speed and there's so many of them - it's hard to  process them or identify specific obsessions sometimes and as a result I  tend to doubt whether I do have OCD or not. Instead, often I just  experience a general heightened level of anxiety and I have certain  physical compulsions like cracking my knuckles and blinking hard three  times (3 and 5 are my \&quot;good numbers\&quot;).\n\nHowever,  my more ritualistic compulsions are usually preceded by much more  identifiable specific obsessions, for example I run the tap for five  seconds before filling my glass up and I have to turn the tap off after  five seconds, as a response to the obsession that the water will taste  bad and/or make me sick.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone experiences something similar.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:04:08.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmawy6&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD and OCD&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmawy6/adhd_and_ocd/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;-seeker_&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hello everyone,\n\nMy life is falling apart and I have to take action now.  I go to bed when most people wake up. And these days I stay in bed for the whole day today. Doing literally almost nothing on several days. I started with my internship in september, but had to quit 5 weeks ago because of mental &amp; physical health problems.\n\nI am also thinking of quitting my study, for the 5th time!!!  \nI find it really difficult to have a side job next to my study. When I am studying, all of my mental focus goes into that. Which drains my mental battery totally. One of the reasons that I want to quit, is that I can start to earn money and focus only on photography. Instead of getting deeper in debt, without knowing if this study is going to benefit me in the future.\n\n\\*\\*A little background story (studies &amp; balance)\\*\\*  \nI am a 27 years old, creative guy. Photography is my passion, as I am a visual person. In the past, I've quit my studies multiple times(4x).\n\nI am now studying for the fifth time, but this time a creative study (multimedia design). During my 1st year I lived with family, so they did everything for me in the house. During the 2nd year, I moved on my own, just when the covid pandemic started. Studying from home made living on my own feel as if I am riding a bike with side wheels. Because I didn't have to go by train to the university, which saved me time and energy. With several other benefits. During the 3rd year, this year, things changed drastically... i started an internship and my bad focus gave me a hard time! I was forgetful too sometimes. I came also often too late. My life had no stability/balance anymore and I became very tired. There was also something going on with my physical health **(see side note)**. So I decided to quit my internship to focus on my physical and mental health.\n\nIt has been five weeks since I quit. Now I am thinking of quitting my study again and to follow my passion: photography. But.... I am doubting if this is the right decision.\n\n**side note: TRT** In the 2nd year of my study I started TRT(testosterone replacement therapy) which gave me extra energy and I went to the gym a lot with the extra time I had, due studying at home. I lowered my dosage, because it had a negative impact on studying and because of side-effects. And eventually I quit TRT when I left my internship, because of these side-effects. So my testosterone is now being 'restarted'. Initially I didn't need TRT, but I was stubborn. Symptoms of ADHD could have been the reason that I thought that I had low testosterone symptoms.\n\n**Therapy** In april 2021 I stopped after being 2 years in therapy (for my anxiety, emotion regulation and forming my own identity). During therapy I learned where my intense emotions arised from (scheme therapy) so that I could be more rational. Therapy helped me a lot, by giving me mental space and it made me mentally more stable.\n\n**Diagnosis &amp; personality disorder interview** In my diagnosis it was mentioned that:-my attachment style is: anxious-ambivalent(in Dutch: onveilig (ambivalent) gehecht).-that i have traits in my personality from cluster B and C personality disorders, which also could be coming from ADHD.I have social anxiety and agora phobia.\n\nI also had an interview to asses if I had a personality disorder. Only thing, this was with a woman and I am shy with women, so I held myself in during this interview... so no personality disorder and my psychologist told me one that I don't have one, because my problems are not that severe when compared to people with a personality disorder diagnosis.\n\n\\*\\*ADHD(medication, research, childhood)\\*\\*  \nIn July/August this year, I went to my GP to ask for a new ADHD medicine, but he told me that I had to go to a psychiatrist. the appointment is scheduled halfway February(6months later).  \nDuring the two years of therapy I wanted to start with adhd medication and insisted on having an adhd research, because in the past I used &amp; abused drugs and knew that amphetamine made me stable and gave me a calm feeling from within. I also was tired of my chaotic mind full of thoughts.\n\nI had an adhd research done in 2019, but to an extent I think it wasn't done very well. As an adult I have symptoms of combined ADHD. However the diagnosis was 'delayed', because they were not sure if I had it as a child. My my mother told the psychologist that I was normal as a kid. But she also doesn't really buy the idea of ADHD and as I've known her, I think that she wasn't aware of the symptoms, because she doesn't and didn't know anything about ADHD...\n\nDuring my last conversation with the adhd research psychologist, I tried to ask for some clarification and I didn't get much out of it. I also said that my report cards showed *only* good/excellent results. End of conversation. -.-\n\nWhen I now look closely at my school report cards, from when I was 6-7 years, there are a couple of remarks mentioned about my behavior that could be related to adhd? I don't know for sure if that's the case, but I would love to hear from you guys what you think? So that I can help from a new psychologist and get a new research done.\n\nelementary class 2 - **6 years old**  \n*\&quot;repeating sentences of 4 words is difficult\&quot;(note that I emigrated to the Netherlands when I was 4)*  \n*\&quot;LISTEN closely/carefully!\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;Take your time!!!\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;wants to quickly > innacurate\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;fails according to his own idea\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;...thinks now before he speaks\&quot;*\n\nelementary class 3 - **7 years old**  \n*\&quot;sometimes he wants to do his best so much that he forgets to listen\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;Should wait on your turn &amp; think before you speak\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;should focus more on his work\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;don't hesitate/doubt yourself!\&quot;*  \n*\&quot;is interested in everything!\&quot;*\n\n**School performance &amp; adolescence years at school**  \nAll my school reports and school performance afterwards were good/excellent. I liked school when I was a kid/teenager. Until when I was 15/16, everything went well. I chose a level halfway highschool that was somehow too difficult for me and subjects that were not in my interest, because I thought that I needed those subjects to become a doctor (lolz).. and I started drinking &amp; using drugs from age 16/17. From that point everything went downwards. I started neglecting my homework more(I think that I was inconsistent before neglecting it). Slept always late and came often too late. I also remember that I was the \&quot;class clown\&quot; and loved showing resistance towards some teachers that \&quot;didn't like me\&quot;.\n\n**ADHD medication**  \nI tried ritalin (several brands) and also Vyvanse via the psychiatrist. The results were mixed. I could definitely sit still for a longer period of time and focus on 1 task. Without switching to 1000 other activities. My mind becomes quiet (sometimes). I also was very positive and told my psychologists one time when I took it: \&quot;everything is fine, there are no problems in my life\&quot;. But retention of information during conversations(calling or whats app) wasn't always better, sometimes even worse.. I sometimes felt dumber on them. Also my creativity got worse sometimes and my \&quot;photo editing\&quot; skills were impacted, because I would be less detail oriented. So it really impacts me negatively visually..\n\nAs of now, I got my hands on ritalin (not prescribed). Just took 5mg half way this post, because I was switching to FB and insta constantly. I also experience the same as before: sitting still is way easier for me, I can focus on 1 task &amp; I have more patience. For example when watching tutorial videos. But it's not that I am focussed completely on everything what the guy in the tutorial says, only on the important stuff that I can apply. However sometimes at the beginning I feel rushed &amp; I sense a dopamine high and then after 30-40 minutes I can be chaotic/make more mistakes/ messy. < *is this because I don't have adhd*? People say that the effect of medication is subtle.. Finally my way of thinking gets also blocked/disrupted (thinking deeply &amp; in a diverge way).\n\n**ADHD symptoms?**  \n*I am chaotic when I work &amp; talk. (but I can also be very orderly and detail oriented)*  \n*Shy*  \noften s*low*  \n*I tend to forget what I said or should say during conversations*  \n*I can ramble/talk a lot.*  \n*Low frustation tolerance/ no patience.*  \n*Intrusive thoughts.*  \n*A very busy mind.*  \n*Can't sit still too long with boring tasks.*  \n*hyperfocus and I can read a lot when I am interested in /obsessed with something.*  \n*Especially on Reddit...*  \n*Procastinating until last minute*  \nA*ddictive personality*\n\n\\*\\*OCD or perhaps undiagnosed Borderline personality disorder?\\*\\*  \nDuring this summer I experienced scary intrusive thoughts that really made me scared. So I started researching and found that it was related to OCD. I am 100% sure that I have OCD if I look at my behavior and thoughts... I also read that some of OCD symptoms could overlap with ADHD. And I also found out that some of borderline symptoms could overlap with ADHD. I also can find myself in some of the BPD symptoms. I also know that these disorders are not mutually exclusive, so they can be present in 1 person.\n\n**Finally** I don't want to get a diagnosis from you guys, but I want some insights &amp; help. Also if you can relate to my problems and tell me your experience, that would really help me out.\n\n**Questions:** \\-Do you guys think that I might have adhd? Or am I too obsessed with getting a diagnosis?-Should I go back go former psychologist?  \n\\-Or should I search for another mental health institution with a different adhd research team?(I found one, but the waiting list is: 5-6 months again...)?  \n\\-Concerning adhd medication, have you also experienced the same effects? any similarities?  \n\\-If you have OCD or BPD (with/without adhd), could you share your story/experience/advice with me?\n\n**TLDR:** I am looking for help, advice &amp; experiences.. I am unsure whether I have ADHD, OCD and/or BPD, which are causing problems in my life, especially at school/internship. I have quit several studies and I am thinking of quitting again. Because I find it really difficult to have a stable and balanced life. I have tried adhd medication with mixed result. I also share some remarks from my teachers during elementary school and also some symptoms that I have.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:04:04.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmawvm&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Need your support, advice &amp; help please!

It's interesting work because I switch from firm to firm and things don't stay the same. Now there are times when there's no work but that's not a problem because the contract covers this in between. A blessing because it's like paid offtime. Now here lies also the trap I fall in everytime.\n\nI sleep, wake up and there's nothing I get done because I don't find the motivation. I literally just laze around and read stories, books etc. on my phone the whole day until I'm tired out. I also become literally the Personification of unsocial, because suddenly my introvert personality is like hiked up to the maximum. When family or friends are contacting me, I'm just filled to the brim with annoyance and the desire to not being disturbed.\n\nI sink my entire energy in the task of reading and wholly ignore things like doing household chores, washing dishes, contacting people, just because I find them boring and can't bring myself to care. The days blur together. Then when there's a new task for work suddenly it changes. I come home tired from work, but thanks to my Medikinet medication I can go through the day and even when tired I finish boring task because I care. I have a routine then \n\nBut this laziness periods are dangerous. I don't even work out during them, so all the effort invested are gone and I start from scratch. It's a spiral but I don't really know how to get out of it..&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T18:00:37.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmatz5&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Laziness, Apathie and no motivation&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmatz5/laziness_apathie_and_no_motivation/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;RobGioRomo&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I need advice. I don’t know what to do. I’ve ruined my relationship with my wife. She’s had enough and is planning to move out in January. \n\nMost of the time, I don’t help with the tasks around the house such as laundry, dishes, taking out the trash, etc…I do them when I remember to or when I can get myself to actually even get them started, but I struggle so much to actually get up and do things. It’s embarrassing and I hate that I’m like this. It’s gotten extremely bad and my wife has had enough. We have 3 kids. A soon to be 5yo daughter, a 3yo daughter, and an 8mo son. She has a lot on her plate every day. On top of taking care of the kids all day, she also has a couple of side businesses that she tries to manage all on her own. It’s really hard for her to keep up with all the house work with everything else she has going on. Yet, I still come home from work and manage to just loaf around most of the time. I feel like a piece of shit for it as well, but most of the time, I can’t control it.\n\nI just recently started talking to a counselor, but it might be to late. I want us to try couples counseling, but she’s never believed in it. I told her we need to at least try it and she says that doesn’t mean she’s not going to move out. I don’t want that to happen. I don’t want to put my kids through any of this. I just hate the idea of my babies wondering what is going on and wanting for either one of us to be there and we just can’t be.

It is funny, because when I see these posts, I think “this is normal”.I am now realizing that most of my best friends I grew up with and consider my only close friends, all have been diagnosed with adhd. I also have close family members with adhd. So, when asking everyone with advice everyone seems to think these things are “normal”. Well anyways… I have been grieving the loss of my 10 year old dog. She died two weeks ago and at first I felt extremely lost but a healthy grief. The new thing is that I went and met a rescue dog and brought him home even though my gut was telling me no and introduced home to the family and existing dog. When I realized it wouldn’t work, I “woke up” and realized how bad of an idea it was. I took him back to the foster and felt extreme guilt and told myself that I’m not going to put another creature through my impulsive behavior while I’m grieving. Not to mention I’m going to nursing school and do not need to take in another dog. Well a few days later, I see a dog that needs a new home and I start feeling incredibly passionate and almost obsessive making plans for a new dog. Then the next day I let it go and then at some point the cycle sparks again. Is this what impulsivity is? Can adhd symptoms be more intense during bereavement?&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:48:28.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmake5&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Impulsive tendencies&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmake5/impulsive_tendencies/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;shirayuku_desu&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hi, I’m college student who has a boyfriend with ADHD. He has trouble putting focus into his work, despite telling himself he’d do his best for the semester. His under performance put a toll on his mental health, and I feel helpless for not being able to help. \n\nBefore recommending using meds- He has. I believe he’s taking Adderall, since he always mentions it before studying. But the side effects that come along are extreme, it makes him feel numb and super depressed. I remember talking about taking a new prescription, something that’s less intense, but provides the focus to concentrate on his studies. Well- he instantly panicked . As a psyc student, I felt inconsiderate because he probably did take other meds- but they were probably just as bad…. felt very insensitive, so I reassured him afterwards. I love him so much, though I’m not sure what I can do to help\n\nThe only thing I saw that might help is studying or doing work for short periods at a time (5-10 minutes). So suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-Thank you&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:47:23.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmajk8&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Studying tips&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmajk8/studying_tips/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;eht_amgine_enihcam&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Some days the Vyvance works really well.

However, I did a proper search on what foods are actually acidic. \n\nOat meal is highly acidic. The cheese I chuck on is also acidic. I think this is what killed the Vyvance. Just looking at it, I would have thought it was basic/neutral. \n\nI like bacon/salami/high fat meats. These also apparently decrease absorbtion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould a more alkaline diet boost medication effectiveness for most people with ADHD as the western diet tends to be fairly acidic?

Everyday I drank a ton of water, but I still felt awful at the end of the day. Well, I found a solution! Stimulants can cause dehydration, but if you drink too much water, it’ll dilute the important minerals and electrolytes your body needs. To get around this, I’ve started making my own electrolyte drink. I’ve been feeling so much better!\n\nJust put a pinch or two of Himalayan pink salt in your water and then add some liquid flavor to cover up the taste of the salt. That’s it! \n\nYou can use other salt, but pink salt is best because it has extra minerals in it or something.\n\nHappy hydration!&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:41:29.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmaewd&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;DIY Gatorade/Liquid IV for those on stimulants!&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmaewd/diy_gatoradeliquid_iv_for_those_on_stimulants/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;-sushithegoldfish-&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hey y'all!\nI got diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD in September of this year after a lifetime of what now seem like very obvious symptoms haha. My psychiatrist also said that I exhibit anxious tendencies and some people find that their anxiety becomes worse on stimulants. I'm currently taking 60mg of Vyvanse daily because I've found that anything lower does not help regulste my ADHD symptoms at all. Unfortunately, I've also found that my anxiety is worse when I'm on my medication. I become anxious very easily, and struggle to bring myself down from it, essentially causing me to shut down and become very snappy with people around me (which I feel awful about afterwards and always apologize).\nDoes anyone else experience this?\nI'm just nervous to talk to my primary care doctor or my psychiatrist about it because I really do not want to go through changing medications again.\nThank you in advance for any advice or support!&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:38:57.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rmacxi&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Anxious on Vyvanse&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmacxi/anxious_on_vyvanse/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;iliketxt&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is my first post on here, I'm sorry but I just need to get this off of my chest\n\nI had issues since I was young but I was always unable to treat them due to money problems (America) or people not taking me seriously. I always hoped that it would go away when I'm older but now it feels like it had gotten worse. Ever since the start of high school, I struggled to pay attention in class or it will take me hours to do a simple worksheet because I can't force myself to focus. I was always scolded by my parents for not being able to sit still. I started to lose track of time easily (I would take time to think for a few minutes but it ends up being an hour as an example) and I would have these mood swings where I would be energetic and happy one minute then depressed and lethargic the next. Everyone around me noticed these things and pointed them out to me so I wasn't the only one who realized something was wrong. I began doing research on my own and discovered what ADHD was. I would take all of these questionnaires and read all these articles off of medical sites that highly suggest that I should get consulted for ADHD. I came across the subreddit and it was the first time I felt like I was understood. The thing is, I can't get consulted for ADHD because my parents tell me that it would cost too much out-of-pocket money we don't have. I have other siblings that cost money also so I'm not exactly a priority right now. Yet my GPA is at an all-time low because my symptoms are getting worse. 5 minutes of daydreaming turned into 2 hours, my teachers would talk for an entire hour and I would listen and take notes yet I forget that I'm in the classroom twenty minutes in. I struggle to keep focus no matter how much I force myself to do it. That's just some of it and I'm so scared that I can't do anything about it because I can't get these issues treated. I'm so scared that my GPA will stay low because I can't pull myself together. I'm in my junior year and it's halfway through, I'm afraid that I won't get accepted into any good colleges. I don't want to be like everyone else in my family but I feel like I will.

Mostly monotonous data processing. However I’m beginning to think it’s ADHD symptom as I physically cannot tolerate the boredom of it, it makes me very apathetic. For example I cannot focus on a piece of work for more than 5 minutes without my mind wandering and looking stuff up online or chatting or going on my phone. Has anybody has this symptom and attributed it to ADHD? It’s to the point the boredom is extremely uncomfortable. Also the same goes for meetings. I can’t sit still after about 15 minutes in and feel desperate for it to end, and restless and unable to engage.\n\nThanks in advance!&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:28:22.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rma4fy&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Boredom intolerance&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rma4fy/boredom_intolerance/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Illustrious_Gur_5908&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I’m currently freaking out a little and I’m scared that my mental health won’t get fixed and I’ll die alone because no one wants to be around me.

I do Pilates/yoga type stuff and on my meds I can really focus on activating the elusive deep core, I feel strong, so in tune with my body, and energized throughout.

I'm F23 and I've only been diagnosed with combined-type ADHD in September, so things are quite new to me.\n\nIn February, I'll be starting a new study at a school that I've always wanted to go to. Now, I've done multiple studies in the past, but never been able to finish them because I found out it wasn't really what I'm looking for. Looking back at it, I also kind of struggled in class because of my ADHD, I think. I think I'm a fast learner, I just get distracted real fast and long explanations don't do anything for me. It's funny though because I never had issues back in middle school... I always used to be the top goody-two-shoes kid and now I'm just not. Which kinda messes with me as well.\n\nI was wondering if people in here can share tips or experiences on how they followed their studies/managed to do their homework/etc? I'm really scared I'll fail again, but I'm also motivated! \n\nIm looking forward to it!&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:06:34.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm9n55&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD and studying?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm9n55/adhd_and_studying/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Motherfunkers&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[removed]&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T17:01:02.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm9inb&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Getting bored with relationships&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm9inb/getting_bored_with_relationships/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gator--wave&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I went to one of the top public universities in my state, got a 32 on the ACT, and had my whole life planned out.

guys, I got diagnosed not too long ago (I'm 27 and a woman). I know maladaptive daydreaming is often associated with ADHD and I just wondered whether my irrational and strong bond with my Teddy bear (his name is Teddy) may in any way be connected to this. \n\nLike, I have a whole backstory for him, there is a whole world of teddies (they're just nocturnal, so people and teddies keep missing each other) and Teddy always knows or is related to other teddies we (my husband got in on this lore) come across. Like on TV or in a store front and it's be like \&quot;Oh, that's his cousin Gladys\&quot; \n\nAnd I genuinely love that Teddy. Like, I would mourn him like I would a person if anything happened to him. \n\nDo any of you have a plushie/doll/thing you love/anthropomorphize? If not, mind giving your two cents on the matter of whether you think it may be related to ADHD or not? :)&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T16:50:14.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm9a99&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Do you still have a plushie?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm9a99/do_you_still_have_a_plushie/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fendaren&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I was in my 30s when I first made the realization that I had executive function problems. Looking back on my childhood it's so evident now, but being told I was lazy and emotional growing up had convinced me I was. \n\nMy wife and I are veterans and get our healthcare through the VA. We luckily have a local VA clinic in our community, so we don't have to drive to KC for every appointment. Being children of the 70s, we grew up and developed our mental health issues and didn't get diagnosed or treated. So it took until our mid 30s before we did anything about it. \n\nI approached my VA therapist about possible executive function issues, maybe adhd, maybe emotional issues. It was all blown off. She didn't like labels and my masking was good enough to make her think I was fine. So I got zoloft and that was it. I didn't think to talk to my psychiatrist about it, so I let it go. But things got worse.  \n\nThis was 6 or 8 years ago, I'm now almost 45. In that time I have educated myself about attention and mood disorders, but you can only do so much with executive dysfunction and little to no professional help. I would let it go, but things would get bad, financially or relationship wise. So I would try to get help. I was passed between 4 or 5 different psychiatrists in this time, all of which were less than helpful. I haven't had a therapist in a couple years. \n\nI finally wrote a message to the mental help department itself pleading for help. I thought I had it, but it's clear the mental health department of the kcva is understaffed and at least partially incompetent (I say partially because my wife has gotten pretty good care with her mental health.)\n\nI have decided to go outside the VA, but my finances are horrible, thanks in large part to my untreated whatever I have. I don't know where to go that's cheap enough but actually will help me.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T16:49:56.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm99zl&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm giving up on VA mental health care, is there somewhere else to go that's good and inexpensive?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm99zl/im_giving_up_on_va_mental_health_care_is_there/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:46,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;naura_&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I had to make a call to talk (!) to a customer service person.

I am on adderall (40 in the AM, 20 in the PM) and Zoloft. My therapist suggested Seroquel for sleep as well as not taking my PM Adderall (I take it at 3pm). She feels 3pm is too late and may be feeding into my sleep issues. \nI started with Seroquel a few days; at 1st 25mg but this didn't do much so I upped it to 50mg before bed (per therapist directions). I am sleeping at night but I am tired and groggy for 2 to 4 hours in the AM...even after 40mg of adderall and a cup of coffee. Also, by 5pm or so I find I get easily angered...more like free-floating aggression than explosive anger. Everything annoys me and I grumble a lot. \nSo, my question is this...have any of you been prescribed  Seroquel for insomnia? How was it/is it? Anyone take anything else for insomnia?\nI like getting sleep but hate feeling groggy when I wake. I stopped waking-and-baking years ago to avoid this feeling.\n\n(My current insomnia: awake until 2am-4am, tossing and turning, switching from my bed to my couch, beginning to drift off only to wake up and be awake for some time, getting 2-4 hours sleep (I have school-age kids), naps are VERY RARE).\n\nThanks Everyone.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T16:18:32.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm8lob&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Seroquel for sleep/insomnia&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm8lob/seroquel_for_sleepinsomnia/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:55,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;oceanrue&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Maybe I live under a rock, but imagine a college that was structured like high school.  It may be just me, but the annoying block scheduling and same 5 classes for 70 minutes a day is what kept my grades up.  \nInstead of seemingly impossible goals, and days between classes, inaccessible professors… Everything was so much easier to retain and pay attention to when there was more time spread out with teachers and subjects.  So why not do it in college?  Why not force a schedule where you don’t have the abundant free-time and instead are given information slowly and consistently.  We all got straight A’s in high school because we mirrored each other and were forced to focus.\n\nWork and school are two different things.  Work, in my opinion, is much easier to pay attention to than phalanges and thoraxes.  Or numbers and logic..?

Since corona happened we made up with most members of the group and regularly meet on online calls.\n\nRecently I have been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD by a professional and have been prescribed meds. I decided to tell this to my friends in the group. One of my friends in the group told me that he doubts that I have ADHD, because in his opinion I dont have the right symptoms, and that he knows it well from experience with living with his gf (hyperactive ADHD) and reading on the subject. He also accused me of not reading enough, which is fair, I have just been diagnosed last month.\n\nThis really hurt me and I started questioning about opening up to people on the issue. I know that there is a common joke in the adhd subs that people don't take the diagnosis seriously, but when I faced the same reaction from a close friend it really hit me.\n\nMy question is, is this friendship salvageable?

Basically I just have to train my brain to be more open to new things.  Some little things I can do to work on it are things like take a different route to work, order something new from a restaurant, or try an experience that I've never done before.\n\nHas anyone else here had an issue with cognitive flexibility and was there anything that helped you deal with it?

I feel like I can’t continue like this but I just can’t afford the private route. \n\nWhen I read up on ADHD articles “get medicated” is just thrown around like it’s easy, I just don’t know what to do.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:55:03.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm82vg&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How do people get medication so easily?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm82vg/how_do_people_get_medication_so_easily/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:62,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;extrovert-actuary&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;So I’m all for people being safe and such, but I’m fucking dying inside working remote for 2yrs straight.

I have always been super highly functional in social settings, but hours will slip by in an ADHD fog without others around.\n\nIn school I could ace tests and participate in class but could never get my homework done.\n\nI tried running my own business until I realized I just couldn’t get the solo back office stuff done when I wasn’t with clients.\n\nNow I went back into an office environment… only to have to work remote.  Just because I’m collecting a paycheck doesn’t mean I can stay focused at home any better than I could before.  My wife (teacher) gets home at 4 and I feel like someone finally turned the lights on in my brain and I’m ashamed of how much time slipped by uselessly the rest of the day.\n\nFuck.\n\nAnyway, thank you to whoever read this far.

(it’s never aggressive emotions, always sads or upset.) he feels like im attacking him and pointing all the blame on him when it’s not true and we know this is a cause of his adhd and ive tried wording things better in order to not cause this but i also cannot word things properly in english always so this can really hurt it too. i think this may also be due to him starting a higher dose of vyvanse over the summer?  i know the crashes are a lot worse as well as low appetite which after awhile will make people irritable. i’m currently at a loss right now due to an argument that we couldnt solve properly and i would just like some advice on how i could help take care of him and navigate his feelings better. it’s hard for him to express himself properly plus we cant have proper schedule due to my work which affects some object permanence issues (when im gone it’s very emotionally hard for him; gets upsets or disturbed more easily (almost like if im gone i’ll always be gone) maybe a fight is more likely to happen, but then when we’re reunited it’s like a puppy, very happy everything is okay again.) and also delays the solving of problems. (we see each other for 4 days then away 4 days). when you’re having all these emotions or a crash what can someone do for you? is there a way to make this easier? although i care for him and want to make him have a comfortable time, it’s really hard having a partner with this diagnosis at times..if anyone has and suggestions on things i can implement to either help support him or the relationship i would gladly appreciate it.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:50:34.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm7zdz&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;seeking advice for partners adhd&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm7zdz/seeking_advice_for_partners_adhd/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;captansam&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[removed]&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:47:38.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm7x9i&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Online options for diagnoses?

Certainly willing to rediagnose for ADD/ADHD and ensure no other health factors, etc. But....I'd specifically like adderall because it is what I tried with such great results.

I've suspected it for awhile but was kind of in denial? I And sorry if I ramble - but I'm trying to figure out how to express this feeling. \n\nThroughout my life, all the signs that pointed towards me having ADHD that I've written off or been told that are character flaws or even failures of myself are all bubbling up to the surface again. \n\nThe biggest one that I've struggled with is how all these things such as lack of consistency, forgetfulness, missing details (a BIG one in my career) aren't just needing to \&quot;TRY HARDER\&quot; \&quot;you just need to have better time management\&quot; \n\n**\&quot;That's not an excuse.**\&quot; - that is the biggest thing that has stuck with me throughout my life for all these things. I've been told by multiple people and it's been hammered into my brain. So a lot of times I've just sat there and beat myself up for **\&quot;making excuses\&quot;** or **not taking personal accountability**, I **just need consistency or I need to do better**,  **all while wondering why it was SO hard for me to do normal things.** \n\nLike if I failed somehow, whether it be meeting a deadline or making a careless mistake, everyone (I say everyone for the sake of rambling) would remind me that I just wasn't up to par and how did that happen? and I shouldn't be making excuses and do better. \n\nI guess the hardest part is coming to terms with all these things I've thought are personal failures and character flaws were because I wasn't trying hard enough or I was making excuses - I always needed to take accountability for my failures and do better and try harder. I'm not just \&quot;lackadaisical\&quot; or need to focus better and pay attention to details as my mom used to tell me throughout life.  \n\n**I guess its realizing I'm not just playing the victim, or making excuses or a failure as a person - this is an ACTUAL thing this is how my brain operates.** \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk lol&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:36:08.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm7op1&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:21,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;21&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:19,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;19&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;That's Not An Excuse\&quot;&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm7op1/thats_not_an_excuse/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:70,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;eht_amgine_enihcam&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I had all the symptoms.

I hate how if you're relatively high functioning you automatically get slapped with \&quot;he has no problems since smart, he's just eccentric\&quot;.\n\nI've just finished my masters and got medicated a few weeks ago. Before that, I got really good at a bunch of hobbies but dropped them after 1-2 years. People get impressed by the amount of shit I've done, but it's all just jack of all trades. Now I can actually sit through videos explaining stuff, I can give my full attention to people teaching me, I can self teach using textbooks. I thought I was lazy for 20 years and that it was eventually going to catch up to me, and was resigned to just staying on the dole. I knew working 8 hours a day would kill me. I've finally got my licence. There's no ticking time bombs of having to do something in that you've forgotten about. My relationships have improved cause I'm not constantly tired and irritable. \n\nI feel if I was medicated I'd be at a professional level in at least 1 of them. I used to love math but I'm just re-finding my passion for it. Now I have 10 years of catching up to do compared to people who are neurotypical. People say not doing anything catches up to you in university, but I kinda wish it did so I could have had my hand forced to find professional help earlier.

I went back to college as an adult (now medicated)\nI had been a challenge, but I struggle with one teacher/subject in particular.\n\nIt's a very theoretical subject in an otherwise practical course, that's one. So the boredom is real.\n\nBut I realized today the way he words/outlines tasks is specifically ADHD-unfriendly.\n\nTo begin with, his description are often unclear and ambiguous, which makes me have to re-read the instructions several times and still not quite getting it.\n\nThe parameters of the assignments are always VERY outlined, up to the point of micromanaging - stifling any actual creativity.\n\nHe sort of \&quot;scatters\&quot; around information and important data in different places, so it's not centralized. All that, while being really boring. So, I constantly have to search for important info  in several places, getting distracted all the time, making it take much longer.\n\nI have tried to bring up the latter with him, which made him quite hostile toward me.\n\nThis is an individual in quite high standing in my school - and I hate that people like this wil likely sit in that spot until they die and never change anything.\n\nFull disclosure: I used to be a journalist and KNOW I can write.

I knew it wasn't realistic but I'd always hoped I would magically be able to get rid of the feeling of being \&quot;fake adhd\&quot; if a professional could tell me that I in fact do have adhd.\nUntil the past couple months I didn't ever consider myself to be because I never fit any of the hyperactive symptoms. I get good grades (a lot of delayed last minute studying and tears and frustration but hey, results are results.) and I could always get my way out of any authority problems by talking my way out of it (thankfully I rarely take rule breaking to an extreme). Forgetfulness and getting distracted has always been an issue but I always chalk that up to me being lazy. \nCovid gave me a lot less structure in life and I've also freshly graduated and am taking a gap year to write a research paper. It has been an absolutely terrible for me. All the symptoms (that I didn't know were symptoms) seemed to intensify. I only accidentally came across the word \&quot;adhd\&quot; again after I was looking up \&quot;how to fix concentration issues\&quot;.\n\nWhen I pieced it all together, it dawned on me that? Maybe? I might have adhd? I had already started second guessing myself at that moment.  \&quot;Lazy\&quot; \&quot;airhead\&quot; \&quot;disruptful\&quot; are some terms that I've been associated with for so long that it's hard to imagine the problem being anything neurological and not just me at fault.\n\nBut anyway, got my diagnosis. I feel a little validated and it helped that the doctor was so understanding. But the feeling of being an imposter is still there, especially since I was so quick to reach out to a psychiatrist. \&quot;You only think you have adhd because you read up about it and want to associate yourself with it.\&quot; It's a stupid thought, I know. But I can't help it.\n\nThe kicker was that my dad was so unimpressed by the diagnosis. To him, it's not that big of a deal and something I can overcome if I just try hard enough. I'm just worried sometimes that he's right.\n\nI really want to know if there are others who feel that way too and what you do to combat the feeling.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:10:55.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm75bn&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I feel like an imposter&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.84,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.84&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm75bn/i_feel_like_an_imposter/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ancaaremere&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;White F26, 1,58cm, 54kg. Diagnosed with ADHD, currently on Concerta 36mg and Gabaran. Severe myopia as well, treated with glasses/ contacts. \nThis phenomenon I first experienced in 2014, when I was diagnosed with depression and put on Venlafaxine and Rivotril. I took them at noon, felt nothing different whatsoever until I went to sleep and turned off the light and everything was fractals, triangles, mandalas, letters were floating above my phone screen, if I looked outside all the buildings were wavy. This persisted for a week or so, getting milder and milder.\nI have been on Concerta for a month (after a 3 year break) and was also prescribed Rivotril to help with the crash and sleep issues (which I was having already). I took 3 (0,5mg) on different nights, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. \nYesterday I asked my psychiatrist to replace the Rivotril with something that wouldn’t make me drowsy if I had to wake up early, plus I wasn’t feeling too great about benzos. So he gave me 15 0,75mg Zopiclone. I took my evening Gabaran at 8ish and took a Zopiclone at 1AM. Started feeling a bit sleepy, and I start noticing the letters on my phone were distorted. I thought ‘not again’, turned off the light and there we go, beasts dressed in circus clothes, my lipstick crawling like a worm, trees outside dancing and waving at me, cars dismantling an repairing themselves again and again, creatures morphing in and out of existence, all vanishing the moment I turned on the light or my flashlight. \nI have no idea what’s going on, two different occasions, two different treatments, I cannot find anything on Google about visual hallucinations while completely sober and aware especially ONLY in the dark.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T15:05:15.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm716l&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Full blown visual hallucinations EXCLUSIVELY in the dark?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm716l/full_blown_visual_hallucinations_exclusively_in/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;MotherCirce&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm on Concerta.

It's been a long wait with many ups and downs. My worry is what's going to happen? I mean I've lived like this for so long and I'm okay I guess so why diagnose me?\n\nGranted, I have lost countless really quite good jobs due to being unreliable mainly, destroyed relationships for reasons I am yet to understand, 2 attempts on my life, I still make poor choices (I only realise in hindsight), I constantly lose things, I can't concentrate (I should be working right now but after about 30 seconds I'm back here), history of using substances to 'help' but again, turns out that's a bad idea. The usual sort of stuff I guess. They ask for a relative to be there too but my dad doesn't really know what to do and my mum is so against me seeking a diagnosis I don't think she will help. My younger sister is just like me and understands but will they accept what she says?\n\nSide story, I was supposed to be assessed when I was 12/13 due to being somewhat disruptive at home but my mum put an end to me being assessed for some reason.\n\nWhat are they going to ask me? Is this going to be like the Spanish inquisition? What if they say \&quot;no, you're fine\&quot;? I will be absolutely mortified as there has to be something up! If they say yes then it would vindicate all these traits or actions and more importantly open doors to get it sorted. If you really do ever get it sorted? \n\nSorry, I rambled. I knew that would happen.\n\nTLDR: Assessment due soon, worrying what's going to happen and what if they say I'm all good. Crack on.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T14:38:40.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm6iuu&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;After 4 years waiting I have my clinical assessment in 2 weeks.

Because I am stupid and everyone told me to be with her I didnt do it. Now she is with someone else after years of being with me.\n\nSo it has been 4 months now. Almost 5. We didn't talk for almost 2 months now. And she basically ignored me most of the time after she met that guy. I was of course often very mad and just cursed that guy out which she didnt like.\n\nAnyways I still cant stop wanting her back. Which is kinda strange for me. In my \&quot;real\&quot; relationships I didnt slip in a severe depression like I did this time and usually after 2 or 3 months I was at least open for something New.\n\nI also had 4 years of FwB with another girl. When she met someone else I was also upset, then she came back and I still didnt want her. It also was kinda different to what I had with the last girl because in the first 2 years we also Dated other people and so on. And with the girl that is gone now I never saw anyone else. I did talk to others probably a fomo kinda thing but this is a different issue.\n\n\nSo my question is: is it possible to hyperfixate on a person? I am always questioning if I really miss her and love her or if I am just hyperfixating and thinking it is love. \nShe wont come back, she told me many times. But I also feel like I cant let go of her and I am afraid that I am keeping myself in depression because of this. Which would be stupid to let myself Suffer so much even though I dont love her. \n\nI know it is complicated and probably hard to answer or help. \n\nI also wonder if you can hyperfixate for that long. I never did something for more than 3 months. Except for Jobs and long lasting hobbies.\n\nMaybe someone experienced something similar? I am just confused with all these feelings and then this depression, which got better though.\n\nYes I take meds (medikinet) but I just started out. So it is a very small dose. \nHer leaving and me thinking she will come back gave me a lot of Motivation to get help 😅\n\nThank you redditors&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T14:32:47.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm6eu7&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:28,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;28&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:11,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;11&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hyperfixation on a person?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.88,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.88&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm6eu7/hyperfixation_on_a_person/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:89,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;IceCream-Fitness&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I absolutely hate that ADHD is what is wrong with my brain, and not because I am ashamed of it but because there is a stigma around ADHD.  \n\n\nAnytime you have your ADHD symptoms flare up and your family, friends, or significant other are on your back about why you did or didn't do something and you say its because of your ADHD they look at you like your stupid. Like you have complete control over all of this and ADHD is just an excuse, you are just lazy. Yet if I was Bi polar or Autistic then they would understand.  \n\n\nI have had countless arguments with my husband because I don't do things in the timely manner that he would or I don't notice things like he does (Like how the floorboards are dirty and need to be cleaned 😑) After I was diagnosed it got better and I told him why I did what I did and that when I had my brain scan done it actually showed that I process things 50% slower than the average person (Not that I am dumb it just takes my brain longer to process what I am looking at). \n\nI told him I don't see things like him, I don't look at dishes in the sink and I go \&quot;Oh let me put those away now\&quot;. I look at them and go (God those look terrible, I really need to do those later), and I either forget or by the time I go to do them he has already done it. I told him if he notices something then to tell me like \&quot;Hey, the floor boards are really dirty in the kitchen, when are cleaning this weekend can you wipe them down?\&quot;. But he said he doesn't feel that is his job to tell me.... so it is apparently easier for him to do all the things himself and then yell at me later.   \n\n\nSorry for the rant I am just so frustrated with people looking at me like I am just making excuses when I  say I have ADHD. I feel stupid when telling people I have ADHD because they don't see it as a real problem. They don't accept you have a real issue and work with you, they just work around you and yell at you for it.&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T14:25:03.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm69kt&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:11,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;11&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:10,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;10&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I feel stupid when telling people I have ADHD because they don't see it as a real problem&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm69kt/i_feel_stupid_when_telling_people_i_have_adhd/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:90,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;JakobiiKenobii&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I hope this doesn't break the rules, but here's what's going on with me: \n\nI've always had a bit of dry mouth since I was little. So much that my dentist wrote a note for my school to allow me to chew gum during class because I needed to trigger my glands to produce saliva; otherwise, I was just getting cavities and bad breath all the time.\n\nI started Adderall XR this year, and maybe six months before that, I had been on Wellbutrin XL (still am). One of the biggest side effects I've been struggling with lately has been how dry my mouth gets. It's so bad that it gets to the point that I'm getting sores on my tongue on a weekly basis, and the front top (?) of my tongue feels just like when you've burnt yourself drinking something that's too hot--except that feeling is aaaall the time and won't go away **no matter how much water I drink** ): I was eating an apple the other day and couldn't finish it because my tongue was so sore that the juice from the apple made it sting. \n\nI was going to ask my doctor about it, but I wanted to know what some of you do to alleviate this? I've seen \&quot;artificial saliva\&quot; that you can buy in different forms, and I was considering getting that. **I do chew gum from time to time, but because 1. I'm fidgety and subconsciously bite on my tongue, and 2. my jaw misaligns very easily (I have to get it adjusted every two weeks), I end up accidentally biting my lip really hard, creating even MORE pain in my mouth, I just don't see chewing gum worth the extra pain; pretty counterproductive if you ask me.**\n\n\nTL;DR: My tongue hurts all the time from having dry mouth and it sucks. What do you do to alleviate this side effect? Gum isn't as effective most of the time.

Fortunately, I met a friend who made me understand that I should not be blaming myself for who I am and how I do (don't do things). Then I joined this subreddit and I have finally made a decision to call my GP about doing something about this. I highly believe, no I know, I have ADHD and I also am afraid of being on meds if I get diagnosed. I really don't know why exactly I am making this post, but I would like to know how taking your meds has changed your mindset, thought process, etc.,  (and personality? I do not know much the meds will change a person) I don't want to know what you took, just tell me how it helps or not helps you.   \n\n\nIs getting diagnosed even worth it? It is just the process sounds to long and difficult. That and now-a-days doctors only speak with patients on the phone. I hate it, but I can't wait for so long. I am doing my final years at an uni and I want to be a better person, get a job, and get settled somehow. My belief is knowing myself better or being on meds would help me, but why is the process so goddamn difficult?&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T14:06:23.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm5x9f&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Getting help&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm5x9f/getting_help/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TheRealMasonMac&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[removed]&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T14:01:24.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm5txh&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How would you know if you have ASD?&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm5txh/how_would_you_know_if_you_have_asd/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;LightningBirdsAreGo&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[removed]&quot;},&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-22T13:59:00.000Z&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;rm5s4k&quot;},&quot;num_comments&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;subreddit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ADHD&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I took two days off before my Christmas break to get everything done on time wish me luck.&quot;},&quot;upvote_ratio&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rm5s4k/i_took_two_days_off_before_my_christmas_break_to/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Smeety&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hi Reddit.\n\nI just started on Concerta again after 6 years.\nI stopped taking Concerta 6 years ago because I felt like it wasn't working anymore, and i was starting to feel depressed which i thought could be because of the Concerta, i then tried to start on Elvanse but that made me feel really bad.\n\nAnyway i just started on Concerta again today, and I'm not feeling very well. I don't really feel any kind of calmness i just feel anxious, sad and wired - i know it's my first day but I'm just afraid that it's gonna make me feel like I did 6 years ago, because I got a really bad depression after that whole period and had to drop out of school.

It’s so hard to prioritize my time when I get so hyper focused on each task or just on something completely irrelevant. 

I was just diagnosed last year so I’m still learning how to learn with ADHD but I feel even more pressure to work so much harder to prove my worth bc I’m a Black woman in engineering. I’ve been falling into a really unhealthy cycle of taking more than my prescribed dose to work longer bc I’d waste so much time during the day and it’s just gotten out of hand. it’s like you go your whole life feeling so dumb and incompetent and now you don’t and you just wanna learn everything all the time but that’s just??? not sustainable or normal. anyways idk sorry for the rant, I’m just tired &amp; don’t know what to do</span></div></div>

My apartment is a fucking pigsty, with no exaggeration of the word. I live by myself and my house is beyond messy into dirty, I haven't been able to have anyone over for months. My girlfriend has a few preteen/teen kids and is working two jobs right now, and I spend most of my time at her place. She has very little time to clean, and dishes pile up super fast. Whenever I go over and she's not home, I get the urge to clean to help her out, and feel so much more motivated to do every chore I absolutely hate at my house. She doesn't ask me to, but it feels good being able to help out. I just wish I could get that kind of motivation at my house; instead of the feeling of dread and self hatred. Anyway, I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone else feels similarly.</span></div></div>

Pre 6 months ago I was surviving fine on my medication but I feel it only fixes whatever mode my mind is in. The last few months have been pushing my brain to the limit to where my medicine doesn't do much and effectively, my brain is in permanent fog mode. Whilst my medicine works in pushing away inattentiveness it has lead me to become always on and I struggle to thoroughly relax which is slowly frying my brain, more is coming in than going out. 

I'm glad the Christmas break is here, I need it. Taking a week off the meds, no work, no study and just allowing my brain to refresh. I think, as an inattentive, we focus on pushing our brains harder to meet the expectations but ignore the necessary maintenance to keep it running. Engines that are worked harder are maintained more often.

(I'm not recommending anyone to stop their medications btw, just to consciously make the effort to give yourself deserved TLC). 

Take care</span></div></div>

The 5mg I started with quieted things down in my brain a tiny bit but didn't really do much else.  I've gone up to 10mg with a 5mg booster in the afternoon.   About 30 mins after the initial dose, I feel calmer and I'm able to internally narrate my thoughts step by step a bit (which is a bit odd for me, although it may be more "normal" than 40000 thoughts circling around) but that's about the only real difference for me.   I also initially felt almost grossly hungover at around 1pm (without taking the  5mg booster) but that seems to have dissipated a bit 

I'll discuss with my therapist and then my prescriber in 2 weeks at my next appointment, but I'm wondering if I should be getting more out of it?  Or if it's just the wrong dose or medication for me?  How do you know?

Do most people stop extreme ineffective multitasking, have vastly improved focus (not stopping mid-sentence to check instagram or whatever), are able to prioritize correctly,  more improved motivation, just from meds?   I'm still just in stop mode with paying bills, working on a business I said I'd launch months ago etc.     

I guess I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much and how did you know you found your correct medication? Was it a lightbulb type of thing or more gradual?</span></div></div>

Feeling really disheartened, if in a similar boat, what worked for you in the end/do you have any advice?



So I've been titrating up on concerta for about two months, currently coming to the end of my 36mg. 

- 18mg worked wonders the first day, then slowly went more to the background as time went on, and the benefit was kind of unnoticeable. 

- 27mg again felt very calming and focusing on the first day, felt like it was my dose, but then as the two weeks went on I felt incredibly tired, zoned out, couldn't keep my eyes open etc., they worked for my symptoms but otherwise felt awful, like I'd had no sleep. 

- 36mg then came along and holy crap, first day I felt extreme anxiety/anger, and I would hyperfocus on thoughts resulting in me taking nothing in people said to me. This did eventually level out as the month went on, and for a little while it felt okay - again it did a lot for my symptoms and focus. But now the anger and strong emotions are slowly creeping back, I'm feeling very spaced out when out of the house, and it's almost a feeling of being so focused to the exclusion of the world around me, but without feeling tired thankfully. I just feel so absent. 

This whole experience has left me feeling really disheartened and like a fake - my psych initially told me he thought I'd end up on a high dose due to my severe symptoms, but I'm reacting to these middling doses awfully. I've told him via my online portal but I haven't heard anything I think due to the leadup to Christmas (fun fact didn't organise my next round in time so will be without anything for the first week of 2022 🙃) and it's just making me worry like crazy I won't find the right med/I'm just faking my condition. 

I guess I'm just asking if anyone has had a similar experience and what worked for them in the end. It's hard because I don't think I get regular meetings with Psychiatry UK, so it's difficult to explain my experiences in a succint manner via messages, given how much it's fluctuated, so I think I'd really just appreciate some perspective so I can go into it with suggestions/clarity in mind in order to explain my situation better.</span></div></div>

I  hear a lot about intrusive thoughts and specific obsessions but for me  that often isn't my experience? Because of my ADHD all my thoughts come  at me at breakneck speed and there's so many of them - it's hard to  process them or identify specific obsessions sometimes and as a result I  tend to doubt whether I do have OCD or not. Instead, often I just  experience a general heightened level of anxiety and I have certain  physical compulsions like cracking my knuckles and blinking hard three  times (3 and 5 are my "good numbers").

However,  my more ritualistic compulsions are usually preceded by much more  identifiable specific obsessions, for example I run the tap for five  seconds before filling my glass up and I have to turn the tap off after  five seconds, as a response to the obsession that the water will taste  bad and/or make me sick.

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone experiences something similar.</span></div></div>

My life is falling apart and I have to take action now.  I go to bed when most people wake up. And these days I stay in bed for the whole day today. Doing literally almost nothing on several days. I started with my internship in september, but had to quit 5 weeks ago because of mental &amp; physical health problems.

I am also thinking of quitting my study, for the 5th time!!!  
I find it really difficult to have a side job next to my study. When I am studying, all of my mental focus goes into that. Which drains my mental battery totally. One of the reasons that I want to quit, is that I can start to earn money and focus only on photography. Instead of getting deeper in debt, without knowing if this study is going to benefit me in the future.

\*\*A little background story (studies &amp; balance)\*\*  
I am a 27 years old, creative guy. Photography is my passion, as I am a visual person. In the past, I've quit my studies multiple times(4x).

I am now studying for the fifth time, but this time a creative study (multimedia design). During my 1st year I lived with family, so they did everything for me in the house. During the 2nd year, I moved on my own, just when the covid pandemic started. Studying from home made living on my own feel as if I am riding a bike with side wheels. Because I didn't have to go by train to the university, which saved me time and energy. With several other benefits. During the 3rd year, this year, things changed drastically... i started an internship and my bad focus gave me a hard time! I was forgetful too sometimes. I came also often too late. My life had no stability/balance anymore and I became very tired. There was also something going on with my physical health **(see side note)**. So I decided to quit my internship to focus on my physical and mental health.

It has been five weeks since I quit. Now I am thinking of quitting my study again and to follow my passion: photography. But.... I am doubting if this is the right decision.

**side note: TRT** In the 2nd year of my study I started TRT(testosterone replacement therapy) which gave me extra energy and I went to the gym a lot with the extra time I had, due studying at home. I lowered my dosage, because it had a negative impact on studying and because of side-effects. And eventually I quit TRT when I left my internship, because of these side-effects. So my testosterone is now being 'restarted'. Initially I didn't need TRT, but I was stubborn. Symptoms of ADHD could have been the reason that I thought that I had low testosterone symptoms.

**Therapy** In april 2021 I stopped after being 2 years in therapy (for my anxiety, emotion regulation and forming my own identity). During therapy I learned where my intense emotions arised from (scheme therapy) so that I could be more rational. Therapy helped me a lot, by giving me mental space and it made me mentally more stable.

**Diagnosis &amp; personality disorder interview** In my diagnosis it was mentioned that:-my attachment style is: anxious-ambivalent(in Dutch: onveilig (ambivalent) gehecht).-that i have traits in my personality from cluster B and C personality disorders, which also could be coming from ADHD.I have social anxiety and agora phobia.

I also had an interview to asses if I had a personality disorder. Only thing, this was with a woman and I am shy with women, so I held myself in during this interview... so no personality disorder and my psychologist told me one that I don't have one, because my problems are not that severe when compared to people with a personality disorder diagnosis.

\*\*ADHD(medication, research, childhood)\*\*  
In July/August this year, I went to my GP to ask for a new ADHD medicine, but he told me that I had to go to a psychiatrist. the appointment is scheduled halfway February(6months later).  
During the two years of therapy I wanted to start with adhd medication and insisted on having an adhd research, because in the past I used &amp; abused drugs and knew that amphetamine made me stable and gave me a calm feeling from within. I also was tired of my chaotic mind full of thoughts.

I had an adhd research done in 2019, but to an extent I think it wasn't done very well. As an adult I have symptoms of combined ADHD. However the diagnosis was 'delayed', because they were not sure if I had it as a child. My my mother told the psychologist that I was normal as a kid. But she also doesn't really buy the idea of ADHD and as I've known her, I think that she wasn't aware of the symptoms, because she doesn't and didn't know anything about ADHD...

During my last conversation with the adhd research psychologist, I tried to ask for some clarification and I didn't get much out of it. I also said that my report cards showed *only* good/excellent results. End of conversation. -.-

When I now look closely at my school report cards, from when I was 6-7 years, there are a couple of remarks mentioned about my behavior that could be related to adhd? I don't know for sure if that's the case, but I would love to hear from you guys what you think? So that I can help from a new psychologist and get a new research done.

elementary class 2 - **6 years old**  
*"repeating sentences of 4 words is difficult"(note that I emigrated to the Netherlands when I was 4)*  
*"LISTEN closely/carefully!"*  
*"Take your time!!!"*  
*"wants to quickly > innacurate"*  
*"fails according to his own idea"*  
*"...thinks now before he speaks"*

elementary class 3 - **7 years old**  
*"sometimes he wants to do his best so much that he forgets to listen"*  
*"Should wait on your turn &amp; think before you speak"*  
*"should focus more on his work"*  
*"don't hesitate/doubt yourself!"*  
*"is interested in everything!"*

**School performance &amp; adolescence years at school**  
All my school reports and school performance afterwards were good/excellent. I liked school when I was a kid/teenager. Until when I was 15/16, everything went well. I chose a level halfway highschool that was somehow too difficult for me and subjects that were not in my interest, because I thought that I needed those subjects to become a doctor (lolz).. and I started drinking &amp; using drugs from age 16/17. From that point everything went downwards. I started neglecting my homework more(I think that I was inconsistent before neglecting it). Slept always late and came often too late. I also remember that I was the "class clown" and loved showing resistance towards some teachers that "didn't like me".

**ADHD medication**  
I tried ritalin (several brands) and also Vyvanse via the psychiatrist. The results were mixed. I could definitely sit still for a longer period of time and focus on 1 task. Without switching to 1000 other activities. My mind becomes quiet (sometimes). I also was very positive and told my psychologists one time when I took it: "everything is fine, there are no problems in my life". But retention of information during conversations(calling or whats app) wasn't always better, sometimes even worse.. I sometimes felt dumber on them. Also my creativity got worse sometimes and my "photo editing" skills were impacted, because I would be less detail oriented. So it really impacts me negatively visually..

As of now, I got my hands on ritalin (not prescribed). Just took 5mg half way this post, because I was switching to FB and insta constantly. I also experience the same as before: sitting still is way easier for me, I can focus on 1 task &amp; I have more patience. For example when watching tutorial videos. But it's not that I am focussed completely on everything what the guy in the tutorial says, only on the important stuff that I can apply. However sometimes at the beginning I feel rushed &amp; I sense a dopamine high and then after 30-40 minutes I can be chaotic/make more mistakes/ messy. &lt; *is this because I don't have adhd*? People say that the effect of medication is subtle.. Finally my way of thinking gets also blocked/disrupted (thinking deeply &amp; in a diverge way).

**ADHD symptoms?**  
*I am chaotic when I work &amp; talk. (but I can also be very orderly and detail oriented)*  
*Shy*  
often s*low*  
*I tend to forget what I said or should say during conversations*  
*I can ramble/talk a lot.*  
*Low frustation tolerance/ no patience.*  
*Intrusive thoughts.*  
*A very busy mind.*  
*Can't sit still too long with boring tasks.*  
*hyperfocus and I can read a lot when I am interested in /obsessed with something.*  
*Especially on Reddit...*  
*Procastinating until last minute*  
A*ddictive personality*

\*\*OCD or perhaps undiagnosed Borderline personality disorder?\*\*  
During this summer I experienced scary intrusive thoughts that really made me scared. So I started researching and found that it was related to OCD. I am 100% sure that I have OCD if I look at my behavior and thoughts... I also read that some of OCD symptoms could overlap with ADHD. And I also found out that some of borderline symptoms could overlap with ADHD. I also can find myself in some of the BPD symptoms. I also know that these disorders are not mutually exclusive, so they can be present in 1 person.

**Finally** I don't want to get a diagnosis from you guys, but I want some insights &amp; help. Also if you can relate to my problems and tell me your experience, that would really help me out.

**Questions:** \-Do you guys think that I might have adhd? Or am I too obsessed with getting a diagnosis?-Should I go back go former psychologist?  
\-Or should I search for another mental health institution with a different adhd research team?(I found one, but the waiting list is: 5-6 months again...)?  
\-Concerning adhd medication, have you also experienced the same effects? any similarities?  
\-If you have OCD or BPD (with/without adhd), could you share your story/experience/advice with me?

**TLDR:** I am looking for help, advice &amp; experiences.. I am unsure whether I have ADHD, OCD and/or BPD, which are causing problems in my life, especially at school/internship. I have quit several studies and I am thinking of quitting again. Because I find it really difficult to have a stable and balanced life. I have tried adhd medication with mixed result. I also share some remarks from my teachers during elementary school and also some symptoms that I have.</span></div></div>

It's interesting work because I switch from firm to firm and things don't stay the same. Now there are times when there's no work but that's not a problem because the contract covers this in between. A blessing because it's like paid offtime. Now here lies also the trap I fall in everytime.

I sleep, wake up and there's nothing I get done because I don't find the motivation. I literally just laze around and read stories, books etc. on my phone the whole day until I'm tired out. I also become literally the Personification of unsocial, because suddenly my introvert personality is like hiked up to the maximum. When family or friends are contacting me, I'm just filled to the brim with annoyance and the desire to not being disturbed.

I sink my entire energy in the task of reading and wholly ignore things like doing household chores, washing dishes, contacting people, just because I find them boring and can't bring myself to care. The days blur together. Then when there's a new task for work suddenly it changes. I come home tired from work, but thanks to my Medikinet medication I can go through the day and even when tired I finish boring task because I care. I have a routine then 

But this laziness periods are dangerous. I don't even work out during them, so all the effort invested are gone and I start from scratch. It's a spiral but I don't really know how to get out of it..</span></div></div>

Most of the time, I don’t help with the tasks around the house such as laundry, dishes, taking out the trash, etc…I do them when I remember to or when I can get myself to actually even get them started, but I struggle so much to actually get up and do things. It’s embarrassing and I hate that I’m like this. It’s gotten extremely bad and my wife has had enough. We have 3 kids. A soon to be 5yo daughter, a 3yo daughter, and an 8mo son. She has a lot on her plate every day. On top of taking care of the kids all day, she also has a couple of side businesses that she tries to manage all on her own. It’s really hard for her to keep up with all the house work with everything else she has going on. Yet, I still come home from work and manage to just loaf around most of the time. I feel like a piece of shit for it as well, but most of the time, I can’t control it.

I just recently started talking to a counselor, but it might be to late. I want us to try couples counseling, but she’s never believed in it. I told her we need to at least try it and she says that doesn’t mean she’s not going to move out. I don’t want that to happen. I don’t want to put my kids through any of this. I just hate the idea of my babies wondering what is going on and wanting for either one of us to be there and we just can’t be. It breaks my heart. 

If anyone can give me any sort of advice as to how I could possibly fix my situation or just any helpful advice at all, I would greatly appreciate it.</span></div></div>

It is funny, because when I see these posts, I think “this is normal”.I am now realizing that most of my best friends I grew up with and consider my only close friends, all have been diagnosed with adhd. I also have close family members with adhd. So, when asking everyone with advice everyone seems to think these things are “normal”. Well anyways… I have been grieving the loss of my 10 year old dog. She died two weeks ago and at first I felt extremely lost but a healthy grief. The new thing is that I went and met a rescue dog and brought him home even though my gut was telling me no and introduced home to the family and existing dog. When I realized it wouldn’t work, I “woke up” and realized how bad of an idea it was. I took him back to the foster and felt extreme guilt and told myself that I’m not going to put another creature through my impulsive behavior while I’m grieving. Not to mention I’m going to nursing school and do not need to take in another dog. Well a few days later, I see a dog that needs a new home and I start feeling incredibly passionate and almost obsessive making plans for a new dog. Then the next day I let it go and then at some point the cycle sparks again. Is this what impulsivity is? Can adhd symptoms be more intense during bereavement?</span></div></div>

He has trouble putting focus into his work, despite telling himself he’d do his best for the semester. His under performance put a toll on his mental health, and I feel helpless for not being able to help. 

Before recommending using meds- He has. I believe he’s taking Adderall, since he always mentions it before studying. But the side effects that come along are extreme, it makes him feel numb and super depressed. I remember talking about taking a new prescription, something that’s less intense, but provides the focus to concentrate on his studies. Well- he instantly panicked . As a psyc student, I felt inconsiderate because he probably did take other meds- but they were probably just as bad…. felt very insensitive, so I reassured him afterwards. I love him so much, though I’m not sure what I can do to help

The only thing I saw that might help is studying or doing work for short periods at a time (5-10 minutes). So suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

-Thank you</span></div></div>

I knew to avoid citric acid (sodas and OJ) an hour before and after taking my dose. However, I did a proper search on what foods are actually acidic. 

Oat meal is highly acidic. The cheese I chuck on is also acidic. I think this is what killed the Vyvance. Just looking at it, I would have thought it was basic/neutral. 

I like bacon/salami/high fat meats. These also apparently decrease absorbtion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would a more alkaline diet boost medication effectiveness for most people with ADHD as the western diet tends to be fairly acidic? What would the perfect breakfast be? I think spinach and baked beans are good.</span></div></div>

Everyday I drank a ton of water, but I still felt awful at the end of the day. Well, I found a solution! Stimulants can cause dehydration, but if you drink too much water, it’ll dilute the important minerals and electrolytes your body needs. To get around this, I’ve started making my own electrolyte drink. I’ve been feeling so much better!

Just put a pinch or two of Himalayan pink salt in your water and then add some liquid flavor to cover up the taste of the salt. That’s it! 

You can use other salt, but pink salt is best because it has extra minerals in it or something.

Happy hydration!</span></div></div>

I got diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD in September of this year after a lifetime of what now seem like very obvious symptoms haha. My psychiatrist also said that I exhibit anxious tendencies and some people find that their anxiety becomes worse on stimulants. I'm currently taking 60mg of Vyvanse daily because I've found that anything lower does not help regulste my ADHD symptoms at all. Unfortunately, I've also found that my anxiety is worse when I'm on my medication. I become anxious very easily, and struggle to bring myself down from it, essentially causing me to shut down and become very snappy with people around me (which I feel awful about afterwards and always apologize).
Does anyone else experience this?
I'm just nervous to talk to my primary care doctor or my psychiatrist about it because I really do not want to go through changing medications again.
Thank you in advance for any advice or support!</span></div></div>

I had issues since I was young but I was always unable to treat them due to money problems (America) or people not taking me seriously. I always hoped that it would go away when I'm older but now it feels like it had gotten worse. Ever since the start of high school, I struggled to pay attention in class or it will take me hours to do a simple worksheet because I can't force myself to focus. I was always scolded by my parents for not being able to sit still. I started to lose track of time easily (I would take time to think for a few minutes but it ends up being an hour as an example) and I would have these mood swings where I would be energetic and happy one minute then depressed and lethargic the next. Everyone around me noticed these things and pointed them out to me so I wasn't the only one who realized something was wrong. I began doing research on my own and discovered what ADHD was. I would take all of these questionnaires and read all these articles off of medical sites that highly suggest that I should get consulted for ADHD. I came across the subreddit and it was the first time I felt like I was understood. The thing is, I can't get consulted for ADHD because my parents tell me that it would cost too much out-of-pocket money we don't have. I have other siblings that cost money also so I'm not exactly a priority right now. Yet my GPA is at an all-time low because my symptoms are getting worse. 5 minutes of daydreaming turned into 2 hours, my teachers would talk for an entire hour and I would listen and take notes yet I forget that I'm in the classroom twenty minutes in. I struggle to keep focus no matter how much I force myself to do it. That's just some of it and I'm so scared that I can't do anything about it because I can't get these issues treated. I'm so scared that my GPA will stay low because I can't pull myself together. I'm in my junior year and it's halfway through, I'm afraid that I won't get accepted into any good colleges. I don't want to be like everyone else in my family but I feel like I will. There's nothing wrong with having these issues but what can I do about these issues if I can't get them treated?</span></div></div>

At first I thought it was because I work in a boring admin job that is ‘too easy’ for me and provides no challenge. Mostly monotonous data processing. However I’m beginning to think it’s ADHD symptom as I physically cannot tolerate the boredom of it, it makes me very apathetic. For example I cannot focus on a piece of work for more than 5 minutes without my mind wandering and looking stuff up online or chatting or going on my phone. Has anybody has this symptom and attributed it to ADHD? It’s to the point the boredom is extremely uncomfortable. Also the same goes for meetings. I can’t sit still after about 15 minutes in and feel desperate for it to end, and restless and unable to engage.

Thanks in advance!</span></div></div>

One pharmacy flat out refused to fill it for me, they told me to just go back to my doctor and have them write another script. and another one glanced at it for a split second and said "nah we dont have that". Worst part about it is that i have a paper script and apparently walgreens cant hold onto those, so i have to keep going back and back checking if its in stock instead of just waiting for a notification when its in.

Before adderall I would come home after a long day and force myself to work out, you know, the thing that is regarded as crucial for regulating the ADHD brain. But even when I managed to initiate, I often couldn’t sustain the effort. I’d feel so wiped out and bored that I’d just lay on my mat halfway through. I do Pilates/yoga type stuff and on my meds I can really focus on activating the elusive deep core, I feel strong, so in tune with my body, and energized throughout. When I find the time for in-person classes it’s never wasted. Holding handstand has been a life goal of mine, and I’ve made more progress with three months of meds than years of inconsistent efforts. 

Sometimes I get sad thinking about where I’d be today had I gotten diagnosed younger. Ah well. There is only forward!</span></div></div>

I don't really have friends or know others with ADHD, hence why I'm here. I'm F23 and I've only been diagnosed with combined-type ADHD in September, so things are quite new to me.

In February, I'll be starting a new study at a school that I've always wanted to go to. Now, I've done multiple studies in the past, but never been able to finish them because I found out it wasn't really what I'm looking for. Looking back at it, I also kind of struggled in class because of my ADHD, I think. I think I'm a fast learner, I just get distracted real fast and long explanations don't do anything for me. It's funny though because I never had issues back in middle school... I always used to be the top goody-two-shoes kid and now I'm just not. Which kinda messes with me as well.

I was wondering if people in here can share tips or experiences on how they followed their studies/managed to do their homework/etc? I'm really scared I'll fail again, but I'm also motivated!

How do you guys prevent or at least lessen the crash from your meds? Even if I take a small, instant release dose, I still have a severe crash at the end of the day. This is really the one thing preventing me from taking my meds which do help while they work but it’s hard to outweigh that with the side effects. Plus, I find it hard to take it continuously cause each day I just feel worst from the day before.
Then on top of that I can’t sleep even with a strong sleep med. any suggestions are helpful thank you :)</span></div></div>

I know maladaptive daydreaming is often associated with ADHD and I just wondered whether my irrational and strong bond with my Teddy bear (his name is Teddy) may in any way be connected to this. 

Like, I have a whole backstory for him, there is a whole world of teddies (they're just nocturnal, so people and teddies keep missing each other) and Teddy always knows or is related to other teddies we (my husband got in on this lore) come across. Like on TV or in a store front and it's be like "Oh, that's his cousin Gladys" 

And I genuinely love that Teddy. Like, I would mourn him like I would a person if anything happened to him. 

Do any of you have a plushie/doll/thing you love/anthropomorphize? If not, mind giving your two cents on the matter of whether you think it may be related to ADHD or not? :)</span></div></div>

Looking back on my childhood it's so evident now, but being told I was lazy and emotional growing up had convinced me I was. 

My wife and I are veterans and get our healthcare through the VA. We luckily have a local VA clinic in our community, so we don't have to drive to KC for every appointment. Being children of the 70s, we grew up and developed our mental health issues and didn't get diagnosed or treated. So it took until our mid 30s before we did anything about it. 

I approached my VA therapist about possible executive function issues, maybe adhd, maybe emotional issues. It was all blown off. She didn't like labels and my masking was good enough to make her think I was fine. So I got zoloft and that was it. I didn't think to talk to my psychiatrist about it, so I let it go. But things got worse.  

This was 6 or 8 years ago, I'm now almost 45. In that time I have educated myself about attention and mood disorders, but you can only do so much with executive dysfunction and little to no professional help. I would let it go, but things would get bad, financially or relationship wise. So I would try to get help. I was passed between 4 or 5 different psychiatrists in this time, all of which were less than helpful. I haven't had a therapist in a couple years. 

I finally wrote a message to the mental help department itself pleading for help. I thought I had it, but it's clear the mental health department of the kcva is understaffed and at least partially incompetent (I say partially because my wife has gotten pretty good care with her mental health.)

I have decided to go outside the VA, but my finances are horrible, thanks in large part to my untreated whatever I have. I don't know where to go that's cheap enough but actually will help me.</span></div></div>

One benefit that I didn’t see coming is the ability to relax. I spent so, so much of my life in a form of paralysis, sitting or laying for hours on end, stressing about all the things I needed or wanted to be doing but just not being able to make myself do them. 

Now I can decide to take a break and just fully relax with the knowledge that I can get up and do whatever I need to do whenever I choose to.

It’s such a blessing! In retrospect, I’m not sure I was ever truly able to relax. Visibly I may have looked like I was relaxed but internally there was a million things going on my mind.</span></div></div>

Like many of us, I have insomnia (for as long as I can remember). I am on adderall (40 in the AM, 20 in the PM) and Zoloft. My therapist suggested Seroquel for sleep as well as not taking my PM Adderall (I take it at 3pm). She feels 3pm is too late and may be feeding into my sleep issues. 
I started with Seroquel a few days; at 1st 25mg but this didn't do much so I upped it to 50mg before bed (per therapist directions). I am sleeping at night but I am tired and groggy for 2 to 4 hours in the AM...even after 40mg of adderall and a cup of coffee. Also, by 5pm or so I find I get easily angered...more like free-floating aggression than explosive anger. Everything annoys me and I grumble a lot. 
So, my question is this...have any of you been prescribed  Seroquel for insomnia? How was it/is it? Anyone take anything else for insomnia?
I like getting sleep but hate feeling groggy when I wake. I stopped waking-and-baking years ago to avoid this feeling.

(My current insomnia: awake until 2am-4am, tossing and turning, switching from my bed to my couch, beginning to drift off only to wake up and be awake for some time, getting 2-4 hours sleep (I have school-age kids), naps are VERY RARE).

Thanks Everyone.</span></div></div>

It may be just me, but the annoying block scheduling and same 5 classes for 70 minutes a day is what kept my grades up.  
Instead of seemingly impossible goals, and days between classes, inaccessible professors… Everything was so much easier to retain and pay attention to when there was more time spread out with teachers and subjects.  So why not do it in college?  Why not force a schedule where you don’t have the abundant free-time and instead are given information slowly and consistently.  We all got straight A’s in high school because we mirrored each other and were forced to focus.

Work and school are two different things.  Work, in my opinion, is much easier to pay attention to than phalanges and thoraxes.  Or numbers and logic..? So does any of this make sense?</span></div></div>

Since corona happened we made up with most members of the group and regularly meet on online calls.

Recently I have been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD by a professional and have been prescribed meds. I decided to tell this to my friends in the group. One of my friends in the group told me that he doubts that I have ADHD, because in his opinion I dont have the right symptoms, and that he knows it well from experience with living with his gf (hyperactive ADHD) and reading on the subject. He also accused me of not reading enough, which is fair, I have just been diagnosed last month.

This really hurt me and I started questioning about opening up to people on the issue. I know that there is a common joke in the adhd subs that people don't take the diagnosis seriously, but when I faced the same reaction from a close friend it really hit me.

My question is, is this friendship salvageable? I feel really unvalidated and hurt.</span></div></div>

The way it affects me is I'll be doing something like cooking and my wife will come in and go "Let me join you" and I'll go "No, I  really want to do this a certain way. Or if she says "Hey let's go do this thing" I'll go "No,  you need to give me some advanced notice, I'm not ready for that right now. "  Previously I just thought it was anxiety but my therapist thinks it might be more related to my ADHD.

She gave me some exercises to do to help out.  Basically I just have to train my brain to be more open to new things.  Some little things I can do to work on it are things like take a different route to work, order something new from a restaurant, or try an experience that I've never done before.

Has anyone else here had an issue with cognitive flexibility and was there anything that helped you deal with it?  It's kind of getting in the way of my marriage a little bit.</span></div></div>

I have private health insurance through work which is how I got my diagnosis of ADHD PI. However, the insurance paid for my diagnosis but nothing else, meaning I’d have to fork over £££ to get medication privately which I just can’t afford. 

When trying to go via the NHS I’m told the waiting list is 3+ years?? What am I supposed to do in the meantime? I feel like I can’t continue like this but I just can’t afford the private route. 

When I read up on ADHD articles “get medicated” is just thrown around like it’s easy, I just don’t know what to do.</span></div></div>

My actuarial peers all act like they all drew one big “bank error in your favor” card by being able to work remote, and I feel like I’m all alone.

My dopamine kick is other people.  I have always been super highly functional in social settings, but hours will slip by in an ADHD fog without others around.

In school I could ace tests and participate in class but could never get my homework done.

I tried running my own business until I realized I just couldn’t get the solo back office stuff done when I wasn’t with clients.

Now I went back into an office environment… only to have to work remote.  Just because I’m collecting a paycheck doesn’t mean I can stay focused at home any better than I could before.  My wife (teacher) gets home at 4 and I feel like someone finally turned the lights on in my brain and I’m ashamed of how much time slipped by uselessly the rest of the day.

Fuck.

Anyway, thank you to whoever read this far.  Any advice or suggestions welcome, but I just really needed somewhere to vent a bit.</span></div></div>

22f/21m. my partner was diagnosed with adhd shortly before we met so our whole relationship i’ve seen and tried helping him navigate this experience and medications etc. i’ve tried to read into it a lot and we’ve had conversations about things that are a direct cause of his diagnosis and basically what we can do in hard times due to it. however lately it’s been feeling really suffocating and hard for me but whenever i try to explain to him, his mood swings/flooded w/ emotions just makes it even harder. (it’s never aggressive emotions, always sads or upset.) he feels like im attacking him and pointing all the blame on him when it’s not true and we know this is a cause of his adhd and ive tried wording things better in order to not cause this but i also cannot word things properly in english always so this can really hurt it too. i think this may also be due to him starting a higher dose of vyvanse over the summer?  i know the crashes are a lot worse as well as low appetite which after awhile will make people irritable. i’m currently at a loss right now due to an argument that we couldnt solve properly and i would just like some advice on how i could help take care of him and navigate his feelings better. it’s hard for him to express himself properly plus we cant have proper schedule due to my work which affects some object permanence issues (when im gone it’s very emotionally hard for him; gets upsets or disturbed more easily (almost like if im gone i’ll always be gone) maybe a fight is more likely to happen, but then when we’re reunited it’s like a puppy, very happy everything is okay again.) and also delays the solving of problems. (we see each other for 4 days then away 4 days). when you’re having all these emotions or a crash what can someone do for you? is there a way to make this easier? although i care for him and want to make him have a comfortable time, it’s really hard having a partner with this diagnosis at times..if anyone has and suggestions on things i can implement to either help support him or the relationship i would gladly appreciate it.</span></div></div>

Once as a kid and again in my 20's. I was also diagnosed with depression so I admittedly focused on that vs the ADHD. I never gave the ADHD treatments q fair shake (ridlin as a kid; Strattera in my 20s). As I've grown older (now 43) I have felt more and more like my ADHD is more the root cause of my anxiety and depression. 

That said...I got adderall from a relative and have taken now on 5 or 6 occasions. It's like a new world. I'm not overwhelmed by my thoughts and I feel like the best version of myself. 

I would like to approach my doctor on being prescribed this. Certainly willing to rediagnose for ADD/ADHD and ensure no other health factors, etc. But....I'd specifically like adderall because it is what I tried with such great results. Would it be out of bounds to be frank with my doctor that I've taken it recently (albeit unprescribed) but had very favorable results? 

Any help here on best approach would be greatly appreciated, friends.</span></div></div>

But I was recently diagnosed later in life (primarily inattentive) and I'm still coming to terms with it a bit? I've suspected it for awhile but was kind of in denial? I And sorry if I ramble - but I'm trying to figure out how to express this feeling. 

Throughout my life, all the signs that pointed towards me having ADHD that I've written off or been told that are character flaws or even failures of myself are all bubbling up to the surface again. 

The biggest one that I've struggled with is how all these things such as lack of consistency, forgetfulness, missing details (a BIG one in my career) aren't just needing to "TRY HARDER" "you just need to have better time management" 

**"That's not an excuse.**" - that is the biggest thing that has stuck with me throughout my life for all these things. I've been told by multiple people and it's been hammered into my brain. So a lot of times I've just sat there and beat myself up for **"making excuses"** or **not taking personal accountability**, I **just need consistency or I need to do better**,  **all while wondering why it was SO hard for me to do normal things.** 

Like if I failed somehow, whether it be meeting a deadline or making a careless mistake, everyone (I say everyone for the sake of rambling) would remind me that I just wasn't up to par and how did that happen? and I shouldn't be making excuses and do better. 

I guess the hardest part is coming to terms with all these things I've thought are personal failures and character flaws were because I wasn't trying hard enough or I was making excuses - I always needed to take accountability for my failures and do better and try harder. I'm not just "lackadaisical" or need to focus better and pay attention to details as my mom used to tell me throughout life.  

**I guess its realizing I'm not just playing the victim, or making excuses or a failure as a person - this is an ACTUAL thing this is how my brain operates.** 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk lol</span></div></div>

I'd sleep half the day, be disruptive, get into fights, had some social problems (didn't listen to people), super disorganised. I dealt with the social stuff by high school but still didn't study and cruised through. I hate how if you're relatively high functioning you automatically get slapped with "he has no problems since smart, he's just eccentric".

I've just finished my masters and got medicated a few weeks ago. Before that, I got really good at a bunch of hobbies but dropped them after 1-2 years. People get impressed by the amount of shit I've done, but it's all just jack of all trades. Now I can actually sit through videos explaining stuff, I can give my full attention to people teaching me, I can self teach using textbooks. I thought I was lazy for 20 years and that it was eventually going to catch up to me, and was resigned to just staying on the dole. I knew working 8 hours a day would kill me. I've finally got my licence. There's no ticking time bombs of having to do something in that you've forgotten about. My relationships have improved cause I'm not constantly tired and irritable. 

I feel if I was medicated I'd be at a professional level in at least 1 of them. I used to love math but I'm just re-finding my passion for it. Now I have 10 years of catching up to do compared to people who are neurotypical. People say not doing anything catches up to you in university, but I kinda wish it did so I could have had my hand forced to find professional help earlier. I guess learning to do a lot in a short period of time under pressure might have it's advantages.</span></div></div>

I had been a challenge, but I struggle with one teacher/subject in particular.

It's a very theoretical subject in an otherwise practical course, that's one. So the boredom is real.

But I realized today the way he words/outlines tasks is specifically ADHD-unfriendly.

To begin with, his description are often unclear and ambiguous, which makes me have to re-read the instructions several times and still not quite getting it.

The parameters of the assignments are always VERY outlined, up to the point of micromanaging - stifling any actual creativity.

He sort of "scatters" around information and important data in different places, so it's not centralized. All that, while being really boring. So, I constantly have to search for important info  in several places, getting distracted all the time, making it take much longer.

I have tried to bring up the latter with him, which made him quite hostile toward me.

This is an individual in quite high standing in my school - and I hate that people like this wil likely sit in that spot until they die and never change anything.

Full disclosure: I used to be a journalist and KNOW I can write. I used to love writing. But any assignment I do for him is just devoid of any sort of soul or creativity.</span></div></div>

The benefits I experience from my medication (a stimulant) are life changing for me, but I’m starting to notice that my resting heart rate is elevated and given my family history of heart disease I am wanting to explore the idea of non stimulant medication, but I’m at a loss of where to start. 

If you take a non stimulant medication to help manage your ADHD symptoms could you share what you take and your thoughts on the medication.</span></div></div>

I knew it wasn't realistic but I'd always hoped I would magically be able to get rid of the feeling of being "fake adhd" if a professional could tell me that I in fact do have adhd.
Until the past couple months I didn't ever consider myself to be because I never fit any of the hyperactive symptoms. I get good grades (a lot of delayed last minute studying and tears and frustration but hey, results are results.) and I could always get my way out of any authority problems by talking my way out of it (thankfully I rarely take rule breaking to an extreme). Forgetfulness and getting distracted has always been an issue but I always chalk that up to me being lazy. 
Covid gave me a lot less structure in life and I've also freshly graduated and am taking a gap year to write a research paper. It has been an absolutely terrible for me. All the symptoms (that I didn't know were symptoms) seemed to intensify. I only accidentally came across the word "adhd" again after I was looking up "how to fix concentration issues".

When I pieced it all together, it dawned on me that? Maybe? I might have adhd? I had already started second guessing myself at that moment.  "Lazy" "airhead" "disruptful" are some terms that I've been associated with for so long that it's hard to imagine the problem being anything neurological and not just me at fault.

But anyway, got my diagnosis. I feel a little validated and it helped that the doctor was so understanding. But the feeling of being an imposter is still there, especially since I was so quick to reach out to a psychiatrist. "You only think you have adhd because you read up about it and want to associate yourself with it." It's a stupid thought, I know. But I can't help it.

The kicker was that my dad was so unimpressed by the diagnosis. To him, it's not that big of a deal and something I can overcome if I just try hard enough. I'm just worried sometimes that he's right.

I really want to know if there are others who feel that way too and what you do to combat the feeling.</span></div></div>

This phenomenon I first experienced in 2014, when I was diagnosed with depression and put on Venlafaxine and Rivotril. I took them at noon, felt nothing different whatsoever until I went to sleep and turned off the light and everything was fractals, triangles, mandalas, letters were floating above my phone screen, if I looked outside all the buildings were wavy. This persisted for a week or so, getting milder and milder.
I have been on Concerta for a month (after a 3 year break) and was also prescribed Rivotril to help with the crash and sleep issues (which I was having already). I took 3 (0,5mg) on different nights, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. 
Yesterday I asked my psychiatrist to replace the Rivotril with something that wouldn’t make me drowsy if I had to wake up early, plus I wasn’t feeling too great about benzos. So he gave me 15 0,75mg Zopiclone. I took my evening Gabaran at 8ish and took a Zopiclone at 1AM. Started feeling a bit sleepy, and I start noticing the letters on my phone were distorted. I thought ‘not again’, turned off the light and there we go, beasts dressed in circus clothes, my lipstick crawling like a worm, trees outside dancing and waving at me, cars dismantling an repairing themselves again and again, creatures morphing in and out of existence, all vanishing the moment I turned on the light or my flashlight. 
I have no idea what’s going on, two different occasions, two different treatments, I cannot find anything on Google about visual hallucinations while completely sober and aware especially ONLY in the dark.</span></div></div>

Waiting for my assessment with a free therapy service on January 17th, but my referral for the psychiatrist’s evaluation could take 18 months - that’s the approximate waiting time in the UK.

I was wondering if there are any over the counter medication or natural medicine that could help with memory/ concentration, that I can easily and legally obtain? 

I’m on oral chemotherapy and that also has been giving me brain fog/ cognitive issues.

Any other self-help tips would be appreciated - I literally feel like a failure, incapable to stick to or finish anything I commit to and I can’t spend my life like this for the next 18 months. I’m desperate :(

I’ve had extreme fatigue since I was 16 (now 22). The fatigue is so bad that I can barely make myself something to eat some days, let alone make it to university. It feels like burnout and I suspect it’s because my brain is on overdrive constantly. 

Also, it’s seriously affecting my ability to get work done and to maintain friendships. I’ve lost friends because I’ll see their text come through, read it, and then become distracted so I forget to reply. I’ve never taken any medication for my ADHD since I didn’t really know what was causing this until a year ago, but I’m seriously considering it as I need something to change. 

How was it for you? What changed? Was the experience positive, negative, or both? :)</span></div></div>

It's been a long wait with many ups and downs. My worry is what's going to happen? I mean I've lived like this for so long and I'm okay I guess so why diagnose me?

Granted, I have lost countless really quite good jobs due to being unreliable mainly, destroyed relationships for reasons I am yet to understand, 2 attempts on my life, I still make poor choices (I only realise in hindsight), I constantly lose things, I can't concentrate (I should be working right now but after about 30 seconds I'm back here), history of using substances to 'help' but again, turns out that's a bad idea. The usual sort of stuff I guess. They ask for a relative to be there too but my dad doesn't really know what to do and my mum is so against me seeking a diagnosis I don't think she will help. My younger sister is just like me and understands but will they accept what she says?

Side story, I was supposed to be assessed when I was 12/13 due to being somewhat disruptive at home but my mum put an end to me being assessed for some reason.

What are they going to ask me? Is this going to be like the Spanish inquisition? What if they say "no, you're fine"? I will be absolutely mortified as there has to be something up! If they say yes then it would vindicate all these traits or actions and more importantly open doors to get it sorted. If you really do ever get it sorted? 

Sorry, I rambled. I knew that would happen.

TLDR: Assessment due soon, worrying what's going to happen and what if they say I'm all good. Crack on.</span></div></div>

So to keep it short: i've been in a friends with benefits kinda thing but somewhat more serious. Because I am stupid and everyone told me to be with her I didnt do it. Now she is with someone else after years of being with me.

So it has been 4 months now. Almost 5. We didn't talk for almost 2 months now. And she basically ignored me most of the time after she met that guy. I was of course often very mad and just cursed that guy out which she didnt like.

Anyways I still cant stop wanting her back. Which is kinda strange for me. In my "real" relationships I didnt slip in a severe depression like I did this time and usually after 2 or 3 months I was at least open for something New.

I also had 4 years of FwB with another girl. When she met someone else I was also upset, then she came back and I still didnt want her. It also was kinda different to what I had with the last girl because in the first 2 years we also Dated other people and so on. And with the girl that is gone now I never saw anyone else. I did talk to others probably a fomo kinda thing but this is a different issue.


So my question is: is it possible to hyperfixate on a person? I am always questioning if I really miss her and love her or if I am just hyperfixating and thinking it is love. 
She wont come back, she told me many times. But I also feel like I cant let go of her and I am afraid that I am keeping myself in depression because of this. Which would be stupid to let myself Suffer so much even though I dont love her. 

I know it is complicated and probably hard to answer or help. 

I also wonder if you can hyperfixate for that long. I never did something for more than 3 months. Except for Jobs and long lasting hobbies.

Maybe someone experienced something similar? I am just confused with all these feelings and then this depression, which got better though.

Yes I take meds (medikinet) but I just started out. So it is a very small dose. 
Her leaving and me thinking she will come back gave me a lot of Motivation to get help 😅

Thank you redditors</span></div></div>

Anytime you have your ADHD symptoms flare up and your family, friends, or significant other are on your back about why you did or didn't do something and you say its because of your ADHD they look at you like your stupid. Like you have complete control over all of this and ADHD is just an excuse, you are just lazy. Yet if I was Bi polar or Autistic then they would understand.  


I have had countless arguments with my husband because I don't do things in the timely manner that he would or I don't notice things like he does (Like how the floorboards are dirty and need to be cleaned 😑) After I was diagnosed it got better and I told him why I did what I did and that when I had my brain scan done it actually showed that I process things 50% slower than the average person (Not that I am dumb it just takes my brain longer to process what I am looking at). 

I told him I don't see things like him, I don't look at dishes in the sink and I go "Oh let me put those away now". I look at them and go (God those look terrible, I really need to do those later), and I either forget or by the time I go to do them he has already done it. I told him if he notices something then to tell me like "Hey, the floor boards are really dirty in the kitchen, when are cleaning this weekend can you wipe them down?". But he said he doesn't feel that is his job to tell me.... so it is apparently easier for him to do all the things himself and then yell at me later.   


Sorry for the rant I am just so frustrated with people looking at me like I am just making excuses when I  say I have ADHD. I feel stupid when telling people I have ADHD because they don't see it as a real problem. They don't accept you have a real issue and work with you, they just work around you and yell at you for it.</span></div></div>

I've always had a bit of dry mouth since I was little. So much that my dentist wrote a note for my school to allow me to chew gum during class because I needed to trigger my glands to produce saliva; otherwise, I was just getting cavities and bad breath all the time.

I started Adderall XR this year, and maybe six months before that, I had been on Wellbutrin XL (still am). One of the biggest side effects I've been struggling with lately has been how dry my mouth gets. It's so bad that it gets to the point that I'm getting sores on my tongue on a weekly basis, and the front top (?) of my tongue feels just like when you've burnt yourself drinking something that's too hot--except that feeling is aaaall the time and won't go away **no matter how much water I drink** ): I was eating an apple the other day and couldn't finish it because my tongue was so sore that the juice from the apple made it sting. 

I was going to ask my doctor about it, but I wanted to know what some of you do to alleviate this? I've seen "artificial saliva" that you can buy in different forms, and I was considering getting that. **I do chew gum from time to time, but because 1. I'm fidgety and subconsciously bite on my tongue, and 2. my jaw misaligns very easily (I have to get it adjusted every two weeks), I end up accidentally biting my lip really hard, creating even MORE pain in my mouth, I just don't see chewing gum worth the extra pain; pretty counterproductive if you ask me.**


TL;DR: My tongue hurts all the time from having dry mouth and it sucks. What do you do to alleviate this side effect? Gum isn't as effective most of the time. I already drink plenty of water.</span></div></div>

The past 2-3 months I have been doing very well managing my symptoms and I have been overall, happy. 

About 2 weeks ago I noticed myself becoming angry just by my fiancé’s presence… it makes me feel crazy as he is literally my favorite person. I have been SO irrationally angry with him about nothing. I can reason with myself, but can’t help my anger. 

Not currently on any medications as none I have tried have worked. Been off for 3ish months.

I’m also upset because Christmas is my FAVORITE and being pissy is ruining it for me. 

Please help me 😢😢😢😢😢</span></div></div>

I was unaware of what ADHD actually is for most of my life. Fortunately, I met a friend who made me understand that I should not be blaming myself for who I am and how I do (don't do things). Then I joined this subreddit and I have finally made a decision to call my GP about doing something about this. I highly believe, no I know, I have ADHD and I also am afraid of being on meds if I get diagnosed. I really don't know why exactly I am making this post, but I would like to know how taking your meds has changed your mindset, thought process, etc.,  (and personality? I do not know much the meds will change a person) I don't want to know what you took, just tell me how it helps or not helps you.   


Is getting diagnosed even worth it? It is just the process sounds to long and difficult. That and now-a-days doctors only speak with patients on the phone. I hate it, but I can't wait for so long. I am doing my final years at an uni and I want to be a better person, get a job, and get settled somehow. My belief is knowing myself better or being on meds would help me, but why is the process so goddamn difficult?</span></div></div>

I just started on Concerta again after 6 years.
I stopped taking Concerta 6 years ago because I felt like it wasn't working anymore, and i was starting to feel depressed which i thought could be because of the Concerta, i then tried to start on Elvanse but that made me feel really bad.

Anyway i just started on Concerta again today, and I'm not feeling very well. I don't really feel any kind of calmness i just feel anxious, sad and wired - i know it's my first day but I'm just afraid that it's gonna make me feel like I did 6 years ago, because I got a really bad depression after that whole period and had to drop out of school. I was hoping to hear how Concerta was affecting you the first time you took it, eventually after a break?</span></div></div>
