We describe a new algorithm, the (k, `)-pebble game with colors, and use it to obtain a charac-\nterization of the family of (k, `)-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concern-\ning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have\nreceived increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen\nthe previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characteri-\nzation of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the (k, `)-pebble\ngame with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous\nsparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9].\n1. Introduction and preliminaries\nThe focus of this paper is decompositions of (k, `)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs\nthat certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a\ngraph is (k, `)-sparse if no subset of n′ vertices spans more than kn′− ` edges in the graph; a\n(k, `)-sparse graph with kn′− ` edges is (k, `)-tight. We call the range k ≤ `≤ 2k−1 the upper\nrange of sparse graphs and 0≤ `≤ k the lower range.\nIn this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity\nin the upper range of `. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad-\ndressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs\nand graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.\nOur algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the\npebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that\nproduces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.\nWe define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to\npreviously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide\na unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-\nTutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the\nproperties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].\nSince the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the\nmatroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in\n∗ Research of both authors funded by the NSF under grants NSF CCF-0430990 and NSF-DARPA CARGO\nCCR-0310661 to the first author.\n2 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nTerm Meaning\nSparse graph G Every non-empty subgraph on n′ vertices has ≤ kn′− ` edges\nTight graph G G = (V,E) is sparse and |V |= n, |E|= kn− `\nBlock H in G G is sparse, and H is a tight subgraph\nComponent H of G G is sparse and H is a maximal block\nMap-graph Graph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation\n(k, `)-maps-and-trees Edge-disjoint union of ` trees and (k− `) map-grpahs\n`Tk Union of ` trees, each vertex is in exactly k of them\nSet of tree-pieces of an `Tk induced on V ′ ⊂V Pieces of trees in the `Tk spanned by E(V ′)\nProper `Tk Every V ′ ⊂V contains ≥ ` pieces of trees from the `Tk\nTable 1.

Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening\nof augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs.\n1.1. Sparse graphs\nA graph is (k, `)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m′ edges and n′ vertices, m′ ≤\nkn′− `. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤ ` ≤ 2k− 1, and from now on in this\npaper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn−` edges\nis called tight.\nFor a graph G = (V,E), and V ′ ⊂ V , we use the notation span(V ′) for the number of edges\nin the subgraph induced by V ′. In a directed graph, out(V ′) is the number of edges with the tail\nin V ′ and the head in V −V ′; for a subgraph induced by V ′, we call such an edge an out-edge.\nThere are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of\na sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.\nTable 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.\n1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions\nA k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nFigure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described\nby the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k,k)-tight\ngraphs.\nA map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is\nexactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint map-\ngraphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible\nconfiguration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently\ndefined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1\nA (k, `)-maps-and-trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k− ` edge-disjoint\nmap-graphs and ` spanning trees.\nAnother characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as\nthe (1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. The k-map-graphs are evidently (k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that\nthe converse holds as well.\n1 Our terminology follows Lovász in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases\nof the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3\nFig. 1. Examples of sparsity-certifying decompositions: (a) a 3-arborescence; (b) a 2-map-graph; (c) a\n(2,1)-maps-and-trees. Edges with the same line style belong to the same subgraph. The 2-map-graph is\nshown with a certifying orientation.\nA `Tk is a decomposition into ` edge-disjoint (not necessarily spanning) trees such that each\nvertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2(a) shows an example of a 3T2.\nGiven a subgraph G′ of a `Tk graph G, the set of tree-pieces in G′ is the collection of the\ncomponents of the trees in G induced by G′ (since G′ is a subgraph each tree may contribute\nmultiple pieces to the set of tree-pieces in G′). We observe that these tree-pieces may come\nfrom the same tree or be single-vertex “empty trees.” It is also helpful to note that the definition\nof a tree-piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An `Tk decomposition is proper if the set of\ntree-pieces in any subgraph G′ has size at least `.\nFigure 2(a) shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition; we note that one of the trees is an\nisolated vertex in the bottom-right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2(b) has three black tree-\npieces and one gray tree-piece: an isolated vertex at the top-right corner, and two single edges.\nThese count as three tree-pieces, even though they come from the same back tree when the\nwhole graph in considered. Figure 2(c) shows another subgraph; in this case there are three\ngray tree-pieces and one black one.\nTable 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper.\nThe decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak-\ning a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar-\nsity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper `Tk decompositions;\nand the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.\n2. Historical background\nThe well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k,k)-tight graphs to\nthe existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,\n4 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nFig. 2. (a) A graph with a 3T2 decomposition; one of the three trees is a single vertex in the bottom right\ncorner. (b) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree-pieces and one gray\ntree-piece. (c) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree-pieces (one is a\nsingle vertex) and one black tree-piece.\nEdmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps-\nand-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and\nmatroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].\nIn rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman [11] shows that (2,3)-tight (Laman)\ngraphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. Tay\n[21] proved an analogous result for body-bar frameworks in any dimension using (k,k)-tight\ngraphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo [2] proved the\nequivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay [22] used this condition to give a\ndirect proof of Laman’s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all `Tk for k≤ `≤ 2k−1.\nHaas [7] studied `Tk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and\nproper `Tk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble-\ngame-with-colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of\nsparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation [11, 21, 22, 24].\nA pebble game algorithm was first proposed in [10] as an elegant alternative to Hendrick-\nson’s Laman graph algorithms [9]. Berg and Jordan [1], provided the formal analysis of the\npebble game of [10] and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and\nStreinu [12] generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0≤ `≤ 2k−1, and\nleft as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions.\n3. The pebble game with colors\nOur pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative\nintegers k and `. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm\nfor the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase “with colors” is necessary\nonly for comparison to [12], we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 5\nWe now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a\nfixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves; a move consists in the\naddition and/or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured\nby a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored\nby the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the\nnotation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w.\nWe describe the pebble game with colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed\nmoves.\nFig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves: (a) add-edge. (b) pebble-slide. Pebbles on vertices\nare shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them.\nInitialization: In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start\nby placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for i = 1,2, . . . ,k.\nAdd-edge-with-colors: Let v and w be vertices with at least `+1 pebbles on them. Assume\n(w.l.o.g.) that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw\nto E(H) and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge.\nFigure 3(a) shows examples of the add-edge move.\nPebble-slide: Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace\nvw with wv in E(H); put the pebble that was on vw on v; and put p on wv.\nNote that the color of an edge can change with a pebble-slide move. Figure 3(b) shows\nexamples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices\nare represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them.\nFrom the definition of the pebble-slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is\nalways either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However,\nwhen making a sequence of pebble-slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is\nsometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end\nof the path to the beginning.\nThe output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration.\nOutput: At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location\nand colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble\ngame configuration colors the edges.\nWe say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the (k, `)-pebble game\nor that H is a pebble-game graph.\nSince each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game’s configuration partitions\nthe edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble-\ngame-with-colors decomposition.

Such a monochromatic\nsubgraph is called a map-graph-piece of G′ if it contains a cycle (in G′) and a tree-piece of G′\notherwise. The set of tree-pieces of G′ is the collection of tree-pieces induced by G′. As with\nthe corresponding definition for `Tk s, the set of tree-pieces is defined relative to a specific sub-\ngraph; in particular a tree-piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned\nby G′.\nThe properties of pebble-game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2\nshows that each color must be (1,0)-sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4(a) shows\nthis.\nFor example Figure 4(a) shows a (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decom-\nposition. The whole graph contains a gray tree-piece and a black tree-piece that is an isolated\nvertex. The subgraph in Figure 4(b) has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black\ntree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4(c), however, the black cycle does not\ncontribute a tree-piece. All three tree-pieces in this subgraph are single-vertex gray trees.\nIn the following discussion, we use the notation peb(v) for the number of pebbles on v and\npebi(v) to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v.\nTable 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper.\n4. Our Results\nWe describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 7\nOur first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of [12] to include colors. It says\nthat sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games\ndiscussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly.\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\nNext we consider pebble-game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of\nproper `Tk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\ngraphs in the decomposition.\nThe (1,0)-sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles; thus\nTheorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble-game-with-colors decompositions obtained\nby playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the\nrequirement that the set of tree-pieces have size at least ` in Theorem 2 and the definition of a\nproper `Tk .\nOur next results show that for any pebble-game graph, we can specialize its pebble game\nconstruction to generate a decomposition that is a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk . We call these\nspecialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc-\ntions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results.\nWe observe Theorem 2 that maps-and-trees are special cases of the pebble-game decompo-\nsition: both spanning trees and spanning map-graphs are (1,0)-sparse, and each of the spanning\ntrees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph.\nThe case of proper `Tk graphs is more subtle; if each color in a pebble-game decomposition\nis a forest, then we have found a proper `Tk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper\n`Tk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper `Tk decompositions is\nsufficient to certify sparsity.\nWe now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range.\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\nmaps-and-trees.\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper `Tk graphs coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it is a proper\n`Tk with kn− ` edges.\nAs corollaries, we obtain the existing decomposition results for sparse graphs.\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\nproper `Tk .\nEfficiently finding canonical pebble game constructions. The proofs of Theorem 3 and Theo-\nrem 4 lead to an obvious algorithm with O(n3) running time for the decomposition problem.\nOur last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus\n8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\na maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in\nO(n2) time and space.\nThese time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of [12]\nwithout any change in complexity.\n5. Pebble game graphs\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from [12] to the pebble game\nwith colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over\ndirectly from the pebble games of [12], we refer the reader there for the proofs.\nWe begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game.\nLemma 7 (Pebble game invariants). During the execution of the pebble game, the following\ninvariants are maintained in H:\n(I1) There are at least ` pebbles on V . [12]\n(I2) For each vertex v, span(v)+out(v)+peb(v) = k. [12]\n(I3) For each V ′ ⊂V , span(V ′)+out(V ′)+peb(V ′) = kn′. [12]\n(I4) For every vertex v ∈V , outi(v)+pebi(v) = 1.\n(I5) Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with\na pebble of color ci or a cycle.\nProof. (I1), (I2), and (I3) come directly from [12].\n(I4) This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors.\nThat add-edge and pebble-slide moves preserve (I4) is clear from inspection.\n(I5) By (I4), a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of\nthe same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually\nvisit some vertex twice.\nFrom these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse.\nLemma 8 (Pebble-game graphs are sparse [12]). Let H be a graph constructed with the\npebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly ` pebbles on V (H), then H is tight.\nThe main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble-game graph is the following.\nRecall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble-slide moves to reduce\nthe out degree of v by one.\nLemma 9 (The `+1 pebble condition [12]). Let vw be an edge such that H + vw is sparse. If\npeb({v,w}) < `+1, then a pebble not on {v,w} can be brought to either v or w.\nIt follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\n6. The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We\nstart with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components\nin H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 9\nLemma 10 (Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse). Let Hi be the sub-\ngraph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is (1,0)-sparse, for\ni = 1, . . . ,k.\nProof. By (I4) Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex.\nLemma 11 (Tree-pieces in a pebble-game graph). Every subgraph of the directed graph H\nin a pebble game construction contains at least ` monochromatic tree-pieces, and each of these\nis rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge.\nRecall that an out-edge from a subgraph H ′ = (V ′,E ′) is an edge vw with v∈V ′ and vw /∈ E ′.\nProof. Let H ′ = (V ′,E ′) be a non-empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality\nthat H ′ is induced by V ′. By (I3), out(V ′)+ peb(V ′) ≥ `. We will show that each pebble and\nout-edge tail is the root of a tree-piece.\nConsider a vertex v ∈ V ′ and a color ci. By (I4) there is a unique monochromatic directed\npath of color ci starting at v. By (I5), if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle.\nSimilarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge also in color ci (i.e., if the\nmonochromatic path from v leaves V ′), then the path cannot have a cycle in H ′.\nSince this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning\nof the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out-edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each\npebble and out-edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired.\nApplied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following.\nLemma 12 (Pebbles are the roots of trees). In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of\ncolor ci is the root of a (possibly empty) monochromatic tree-piece of color ci.\nRemark: Haas showed in [7] that in a `Tk , a subgraph induced by n′ ≥ 2 vertices with m′\nedges has exactly kn′−m′ tree-pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas’ result by extending it\nto the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree-pieces, showing the connection\nbetween the `+1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper `Tk .\nWe conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of\nthe decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors.\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\ngraphs in the decomposition.\nProof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,0)-sparse sub-\ngraphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.\nFor the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can\nspan at most n− ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game\ndecomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.\nRemark: We observe that a pebble-game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out\nof the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson’s Laman graph extraction algorithm [9]. Indeed,\npebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in\n10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nMaps-and-trees are a special case of pebble-game decompositions for tight graphs: if there\nare no cycles in ` of the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding ` pebbles must be\nspanning, since they have n− 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range\npebble-game decomposition, then the tree-pieces condition ensures that the pebble-game de-\ncomposition is a proper `Tk .\nIn the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps-\nand-trees and proper `Tk decompositions.\n7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions\nIn this section we prove the main theorems (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4), continuing the inves-\ntigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a\nminimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15\nand illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that\nthis is always possible, implying that monochromatic map-graphs are created only when we\nadd more than k(n′−1) edges to some set of n′ vertices. For the lower range, this implies that\nevery color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above\nfollows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a\nunified framework.\nIn the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi-\nfication of the add-edge move.\nCanonical add-edge: When performing an add-edge move, cover the new edge with a color\nthat is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present.\nThe second is a restriction on which pebble-slide moves we allow.\nCanonical pebble-slide: A pebble-slide move is allowed only when it does not create a\nmonochromatic cycle.\nWe call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section\nwe will show that every pebble-game graph has a canonical pebble game construction (Lemma\n14 and Lemma 15) and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper `Tk and\nmaps-and-trees decompositions (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4).\nWe begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game\nconstructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways\nfor cycles to form in the lowest ` colors.\nLemma 13 (Monochromatic cycle creation). Let v ∈ V have a pebble p of color ci on it and\nlet w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created\nin exactly one of the following ways:\n(M1) The edge vw is added with an add-edge move.\n(M2) The edge wv is reversed by a pebble-slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse\nedge vw.\nProof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7.\nBy Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a\nconnected monochromatic subgraph. (M1) and (M2) are the only ways to do this in a pebble\ngame construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or\na new pebble is put on it by a pebble-slide move.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 11\nvw vw\nFig. 5. Creating monochromatic cycles in a (2,0)-pebble game. (a) A type (M1) move creates a cycle by\nadding a black edge. (b) A type (M2) move creates a cycle with a pebble-slide move. The vertices are\nlabeled according to their role in the definition of the moves.\nFigure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show examples of (M1) and (M2) map-graph creation moves,\nrespectively, in a (2,0)-pebble game construction.\nWe next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb-\nble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases (M1) and (M2) sepa-\nrately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add-edge and canonical\npebble-slide moves.\nLemma 14 (The canonical add-edge move). Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc-\ntion. Cycle creation steps of type (M1) can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ `′, where\n`′ = min{k, `}.\nProof. For add-edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If\nthis is not possible, then there are `+1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color\nto cover the new edge.\nRemark: We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical\nadd-edge moves create cycles in the upper range.\nThe canonical pebble-slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain\nthe same class of graphs using only canonical pebble-slide moves, we need to extend Lemma\n9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that\nreorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same\nthing.\nLemma 15 (The canonical pebble-slide move). Any sequence of pebble-slide moves leading\nto an add-edge move can be replaced with one that has no (M2) steps and allows the same\nadd-edge move.\nIn other words, if it is possible to collect `+ 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added,\nthen it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles.\n12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this\nthe shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used\nin previous work on the lower range.\nFigure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an (M2) step\nat the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble-slides. Since one\napplication of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w′ to w, and a\npath from v to w′ is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the\nsequence of moves we want.\nFig. 6. Outline of the shortcut construction: (a) An arbitrary simple path from v to w with curved lines\nindicating simple paths. (b) An (M2) step. The black edge, about to be flipped, would create a cycle,\nshown in dashed and solid gray, of the (unique) gray tree rooted at w. The solid gray edges were part\nof the original path from (a). (c) The shortened path to the gray pebble; the new path follows the gray\ntree all the way from the first time the original path touched the gray tree at w′. The path from v to w′ is\nsimple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple\npath in H, and that the first move (the end of the path) is (M2). The (M2) step moves a pebble\nof color ci from a vertex w onto the edge vw, which is reversed. Because the move is (M2), v\nand w are contained in a maximal monochromatic tree of color ci. Call this tree H ′i , and observe\nthat it is rooted at w.\nNow consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make\nany of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on\nthis path in H ′i . We modify our sequence of moves as follows: delete, from the beginning, every\nmove before the one that reverses some edge yz; prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves\nthat moves the pebble on w to z in H ′i .\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 13\nFig. 7. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) an (M2) move; (b) avoiding the (M2) by moving along another path.\nThe path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines.\nFig. 8. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is\n(M2); (b) avoiding the (M2) and simplifying the path.\nSince no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated\nthe (M2) move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the\nremaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new\nsequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis.\nThe rest of the lemma follows by induction.\nTogether Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following.\nLemma 16. If G is a pebble-game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction.\nUsing canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble-game graphs\nwith maps-and-trees and `Tk graphs.\n14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\nmaps-and-trees.\nProof. As observed above, a maps-and-trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game\ndecomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps-and-trees must be a pebble-game\ngraph.\nFor the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph.\nFrom Lemma 8, we see that there are ` pebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The\ndefinition of the canonical add-edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of\neach ci for i = 1,2, . . . , `. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma\n12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree-piece with n− 1 edges, yielding\nthe required ` edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\nWe next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when\n`≥ k +1.\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper Trees-and-trees coincide with peb-\nble-game graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it\nis a proper `Tk with kn− ` edges.\nProof. As observed above, a proper `Tk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show\nis that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper `Tk .\nBy Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree-pieces and the decom-\nposition into ` edge-disjoint trees. Finally, an application of (I4), shows that every vertex must\nin in exactly k of the trees, as required.\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\nproper `Tk .\n8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions\nA naı̈ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re-\nquiring Θ(n2) time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction: in the worst case Θ(n)\napplications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring Θ(n) time each, giving a total running\ntime of Θ(n3) for the decomposition problem.\nIn this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time\nO(n2). We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.\nAlgorithm 17 (The canonical pebble game with colors).\nInput: A graph G.\nOutput: A pebble-game graph H.\nMethod:\n– Set V (H) = V (G) and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H.\n– For each edge vw ∈ E(G) try to collect at least `+1 pebbles on v and w using pebble-slide\nmoves as described by Lemma 15.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 15\n– If at least `+1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add-edge move as in Lemma\n14, otherwise discard vw.\n– Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles.\nCorrectness. Theorem 1 and the result from [24] that the sparse graphs are the independent\nsets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction\nfound is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps-\nand-trees or proper `Tk decomposition.\nComplexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to\nprocess O(n) edges added to H and O(m) edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an\nedge of G that is added to H.\nEach of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to\ndescribe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a\nsubroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this.\nAlgorithm 18 (Finding a canonical path to a pebble.).\nInput: Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H.\nOutput: If a pebble was found, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ otherwise. The configuration of H is updated.\nMethod:\n– Start by doing a depth-first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and\nreturn ‘no.’\n– Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path v = v1,e1, . . . ,ep−1,vp = u, where the vi\nare vertices and ei is the edge vivi+1. Let c[ei] be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use\nthe array c[] to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them\nand the array s[] to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each\nedge.\n– Set s[u] = ‘end′ and set c[u] to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in\nreverse order: vp,ep−1,ep−2, . . . ,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c[vi] is set; if so, go on to\nthe next i. Otherwise, check to see if c[vi+1] = c[ei].\n– If it is, set s[vi] = ei and set c[vi] = c[ei], and go on to the next edge.\n– Otherwise c[vi+1] 6= c[ei], try to find a monochromatic path in color c[vi+1] from vi to vi+1. If\na vertex x is encountered for which c[x] is set, we have a path vi = x1, f1,x2, . . . , fq−1,xq = x\nthat is monochromatic in the color of the edges; set c[xi] = c[ fi] and s[xi] = fi for i =\n1,2, . . . ,q−1. If c[x] = c[ fq−1], stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro-\nmatic c[x] path from xq−1 to x using this same procedure.\n– Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the\nsuccessor array s[v], s[s[v]], . . .\nThe correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut\nconstruction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back\nand forth, Algorithm 18 pre-computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three\ntimes: once in the initial depth-first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a\ncanonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O(n) time, for a total of O(n2) time\nspent processing edges in H.\nAlthough we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to\nmaintain components as in [12]. After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated\nin time O(n). Finally, the results of [12, 13] show that the rejected edges take an amortized O(1)\ntime each.\n16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nSummarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom-\nposition problem in time O(n2).\n9. An important special case: Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider-pinning\nIn this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance,\nk = 2, ` = 3. As discussed in the introduction, Laman’s theorem [11] characterizes minimally\nrigid graphs as the (2,3)-tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the\ncurrent paper was submitted, we introduced the slider-pinning model of rigidity [15, 20]. Com-\nbinatorially, we model the bar-slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops\nplaced on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each\ncolor.\nWe characterize the minimally rigid bar-slider graphs [20] as graphs that are:\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\n2. (2,0)-tight when loops are included.\nWe call these graphs (2,0,3)-graded-tight, and they are a special case of the graded-sparse\ngraphs studied in our paper [14].\nThe connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following.\nCorollary 19 (Pebble games and slider-pinning). In any (2,3)-pebble game graph, if we\nreplace pebbles by loops, we obtain a (2,0,3)-graded-tight graph.\nProof. Follows from invariant (I3) of Lemma 7.\nIn [15], we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or\nhorizontal. We model the sliders as pre-colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction.\nFor this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by:\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\n2. Admit a 2-coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest (i.e., has no cycles), and each\nmonochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color.\nThis also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games.\nCorollary 20 (The pebble game with colors and slider-pinning). In any canonical (2,3)-\npebble-game-with-colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the\ngraph of a minimally pinned axis-parallel bar-slider framework.\nProof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12.\n10. Conclusions and open problems\nWe presented a new characterization of (k, `)-sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and\nused it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge-\ndisjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity-certifying decompositions in the upper range\nand runs in time O(n2), which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the\nupper range from [12].\nWe also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity-certifying decomposi-\ntion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 17\nWe defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to\neither a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-\nWilliams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer-\ntificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between\nthe `+1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of `, to matroid union augmenting\npaths, which do not apply in the upper range.\nAlgorithmic consequences and open problems. In [6], Gabow and Westermann give an O(n3/2)\nalgorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from\ndense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths,\nwhich extend a maps-and-trees decomposition. The O(n3/2) algorithm uses two subroutines to\nfind augmenting paths: cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch\nscanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths.\nWe observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester-\nmann’s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen-\ntation of the pebble game, detailed in [12, 13] are simpler and easier to implement than those\nused to support cyclic scanning.\nThe two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then:\nProblem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain\nan implementable O(n3/2) algorithm for the lower range.\nProblem 2. Extend batch scanning to the `+1 pebble condition and derive an O(n3/2) pebble\ngame algorithm for the upper range.\nIn particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm\nfor decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nReferences\n1.

We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a\ngraph is (k, `)-sparse if no subset of n′ vertices spans more than kn′− ` edges in the graph; a\n(k, `)-sparse graph with kn′− ` edges is (k, `)-tight. We call the range k ≤ `≤ 2k−1 the upper\nrange of sparse graphs and 0≤ `≤ k the lower range.\nIn this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity\nin the upper range of `. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad-\ndressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs\nand graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.\nOur algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the\npebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that\nproduces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.\nWe define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to\npreviously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide\na unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-\nTutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the\nproperties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].\nSince the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the\nmatroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in\n∗ Research of both authors funded by the NSF under grants NSF CCF-0430990 and NSF-DARPA CARGO\nCCR-0310661 to the first author.\n2 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nTerm Meaning\nSparse graph G Every non-empty subgraph on n′ vertices has ≤ kn′− ` edges\nTight graph G G = (V,E) is sparse and |V |= n, |E|= kn− `\nBlock H in G G is sparse, and H is a tight subgraph\nComponent H of G G is sparse and H is a maximal block\nMap-graph Graph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation\n(k, `)-maps-and-trees Edge-disjoint union of ` trees and (k− `) map-grpahs\n`Tk Union of ` trees, each vertex is in exactly k of them\nSet of tree-pieces of an `Tk induced on V ′ ⊂V Pieces of trees in the `Tk spanned by E(V ′)\nProper `Tk Every V ′ ⊂V contains ≥ ` pieces of trees from the `Tk\nTable 1.

Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening\nof augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs.\n1.1. Sparse graphs\nA graph is (k, `)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m′ edges and n′ vertices, m′ ≤\nkn′− `. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤ ` ≤ 2k− 1, and from now on in this\npaper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn−` edges\nis called tight.\nFor a graph G = (V,E), and V ′ ⊂ V , we use the notation span(V ′) for the number of edges\nin the subgraph induced by V ′. In a directed graph, out(V ′) is the number of edges with the tail\nin V ′ and the head in V −V ′; for a subgraph induced by V ′, we call such an edge an out-edge.\nThere are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of\na sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.\nTable 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.\n1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions\nA k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nFigure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described\nby the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k,k)-tight\ngraphs.\nA map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is\nexactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint map-\ngraphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible\nconfiguration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently\ndefined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1\nA (k, `)-maps-and-trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k− ` edge-disjoint\nmap-graphs and ` spanning trees.\nAnother characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as\nthe (1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. The k-map-graphs are evidently (k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that\nthe converse holds as well.\n1 Our terminology follows Lovász in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases\nof the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3\nFig. 1. Examples of sparsity-certifying decompositions: (a) a 3-arborescence; (b) a 2-map-graph; (c) a\n(2,1)-maps-and-trees. Edges with the same line style belong to the same subgraph. The 2-map-graph is\nshown with a certifying orientation.\nA `Tk is a decomposition into ` edge-disjoint (not necessarily spanning) trees such that each\nvertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2(a) shows an example of a 3T2.\nGiven a subgraph G′ of a `Tk graph G, the set of tree-pieces in G′ is the collection of the\ncomponents of the trees in G induced by G′ (since G′ is a subgraph each tree may contribute\nmultiple pieces to the set of tree-pieces in G′). We observe that these tree-pieces may come\nfrom the same tree or be single-vertex “empty trees.” It is also helpful to note that the definition\nof a tree-piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An `Tk decomposition is proper if the set of\ntree-pieces in any subgraph G′ has size at least `.\nFigure 2(a) shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition; we note that one of the trees is an\nisolated vertex in the bottom-right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2(b) has three black tree-\npieces and one gray tree-piece: an isolated vertex at the top-right corner, and two single edges.\nThese count as three tree-pieces, even though they come from the same back tree when the\nwhole graph in considered. Figure 2(c) shows another subgraph; in this case there are three\ngray tree-pieces and one black one.\nTable 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper.\nThe decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak-\ning a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar-\nsity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper `Tk decompositions;\nand the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.\n2. Historical background\nThe well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k,k)-tight graphs to\nthe existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,\n4 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nFig. 2. (a) A graph with a 3T2 decomposition; one of the three trees is a single vertex in the bottom right\ncorner. (b) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree-pieces and one gray\ntree-piece. (c) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree-pieces (one is a\nsingle vertex) and one black tree-piece.\nEdmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps-\nand-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and\nmatroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].\nIn rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman [11] shows that (2,3)-tight (Laman)\ngraphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. Tay\n[21] proved an analogous result for body-bar frameworks in any dimension using (k,k)-tight\ngraphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo [2] proved the\nequivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay [22] used this condition to give a\ndirect proof of Laman’s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all `Tk for k≤ `≤ 2k−1.\nHaas [7] studied `Tk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and\nproper `Tk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble-\ngame-with-colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of\nsparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation [11, 21, 22, 24].\nA pebble game algorithm was first proposed in [10] as an elegant alternative to Hendrick-\nson’s Laman graph algorithms [9]. Berg and Jordan [1], provided the formal analysis of the\npebble game of [10] and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and\nStreinu [12] generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0≤ `≤ 2k−1, and\nleft as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions.\n3. The pebble game with colors\nOur pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative\nintegers k and `. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm\nfor the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase “with colors” is necessary\nonly for comparison to [12], we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 5\nWe now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a\nfixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves; a move consists in the\naddition and/or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured\nby a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored\nby the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the\nnotation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w.\nWe describe the pebble game with colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed\nmoves.\nFig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves: (a) add-edge. (b) pebble-slide. Pebbles on vertices\nare shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them.\nInitialization: In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start\nby placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for i = 1,2, . . . ,k.\nAdd-edge-with-colors: Let v and w be vertices with at least `+1 pebbles on them. Assume\n(w.l.o.g.) that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw\nto E(H) and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge.\nFigure 3(a) shows examples of the add-edge move.\nPebble-slide: Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace\nvw with wv in E(H); put the pebble that was on vw on v; and put p on wv.\nNote that the color of an edge can change with a pebble-slide move. Figure 3(b) shows\nexamples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices\nare represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them.\nFrom the definition of the pebble-slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is\nalways either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However,\nwhen making a sequence of pebble-slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is\nsometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end\nof the path to the beginning.\nThe output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration.\nOutput: At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location\nand colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble\ngame configuration colors the edges.\nWe say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the (k, `)-pebble game\nor that H is a pebble-game graph.\nSince each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game’s configuration partitions\nthe edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble-\ngame-with-colors decomposition. Figure 4(a) shows an example of a (2,2)-tight graph with a\npebble-game decomposition.\nLet G = (V,E) be pebble-game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges,\nand let G′ be a subgraph of G. Then the coloring of G induces a set of monochromatic con-\n6 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 4. A (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decomposition.

Such a monochromatic\nsubgraph is called a map-graph-piece of G′ if it contains a cycle (in G′) and a tree-piece of G′\notherwise. The set of tree-pieces of G′ is the collection of tree-pieces induced by G′. As with\nthe corresponding definition for `Tk s, the set of tree-pieces is defined relative to a specific sub-\ngraph; in particular a tree-piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned\nby G′.\nThe properties of pebble-game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2\nshows that each color must be (1,0)-sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4(a) shows\nthis.\nFor example Figure 4(a) shows a (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decom-\nposition. The whole graph contains a gray tree-piece and a black tree-piece that is an isolated\nvertex. The subgraph in Figure 4(b) has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black\ntree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4(c), however, the black cycle does not\ncontribute a tree-piece. All three tree-pieces in this subgraph are single-vertex gray trees.\nIn the following discussion, we use the notation peb(v) for the number of pebbles on v and\npebi(v) to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v.\nTable 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper.\n4. Our Results\nWe describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 7\nOur first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of [12] to include colors. It says\nthat sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games\ndiscussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly.\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\nNext we consider pebble-game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of\nproper `Tk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\ngraphs in the decomposition.\nThe (1,0)-sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles; thus\nTheorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble-game-with-colors decompositions obtained\nby playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the\nrequirement that the set of tree-pieces have size at least ` in Theorem 2 and the definition of a\nproper `Tk .\nOur next results show that for any pebble-game graph, we can specialize its pebble game\nconstruction to generate a decomposition that is a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk . We call these\nspecialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc-\ntions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results.\nWe observe Theorem 2 that maps-and-trees are special cases of the pebble-game decompo-\nsition: both spanning trees and spanning map-graphs are (1,0)-sparse, and each of the spanning\ntrees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph.\nThe case of proper `Tk graphs is more subtle; if each color in a pebble-game decomposition\nis a forest, then we have found a proper `Tk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper\n`Tk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper `Tk decompositions is\nsufficient to certify sparsity.\nWe now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range.\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\nmaps-and-trees.\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper `Tk graphs coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it is a proper\n`Tk with kn− ` edges.\nAs corollaries, we obtain the existing decomposition results for sparse graphs.\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\nproper `Tk .\nEfficiently finding canonical pebble game constructions. The proofs of Theorem 3 and Theo-\nrem 4 lead to an obvious algorithm with O(n3) running time for the decomposition problem.\nOur last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus\n8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\na maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in\nO(n2) time and space.\nThese time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of [12]\nwithout any change in complexity.\n5. Pebble game graphs\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from [12] to the pebble game\nwith colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over\ndirectly from the pebble games of [12], we refer the reader there for the proofs.\nWe begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game.\nLemma 7 (Pebble game invariants). During the execution of the pebble game, the following\ninvariants are maintained in H:\n(I1) There are at least ` pebbles on V . [12]\n(I2) For each vertex v, span(v)+out(v)+peb(v) = k. [12]\n(I3) For each V ′ ⊂V , span(V ′)+out(V ′)+peb(V ′) = kn′. [12]\n(I4) For every vertex v ∈V , outi(v)+pebi(v) = 1.\n(I5) Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with\na pebble of color ci or a cycle.\nProof. (I1), (I2), and (I3) come directly from [12].\n(I4) This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors.\nThat add-edge and pebble-slide moves preserve (I4) is clear from inspection.\n(I5) By (I4), a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of\nthe same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually\nvisit some vertex twice.\nFrom these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse.\nLemma 8 (Pebble-game graphs are sparse [12]). Let H be a graph constructed with the\npebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly ` pebbles on V (H), then H is tight.\nThe main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble-game graph is the following.\nRecall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble-slide moves to reduce\nthe out degree of v by one.\nLemma 9 (The `+1 pebble condition [12]). Let vw be an edge such that H + vw is sparse. If\npeb({v,w}) < `+1, then a pebble not on {v,w} can be brought to either v or w.\nIt follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\n6. The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We\nstart with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components\nin H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 9\nLemma 10 (Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse). Let Hi be the sub-\ngraph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is (1,0)-sparse, for\ni = 1, . . . ,k.\nProof. By (I4) Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex.\nLemma 11 (Tree-pieces in a pebble-game graph). Every subgraph of the directed graph H\nin a pebble game construction contains at least ` monochromatic tree-pieces, and each of these\nis rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge.\nRecall that an out-edge from a subgraph H ′ = (V ′,E ′) is an edge vw with v∈V ′ and vw /∈ E ′.\nProof. Let H ′ = (V ′,E ′) be a non-empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality\nthat H ′ is induced by V ′. By (I3), out(V ′)+ peb(V ′) ≥ `. We will show that each pebble and\nout-edge tail is the root of a tree-piece.\nConsider a vertex v ∈ V ′ and a color ci. By (I4) there is a unique monochromatic directed\npath of color ci starting at v. By (I5), if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle.\nSimilarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge also in color ci (i.e., if the\nmonochromatic path from v leaves V ′), then the path cannot have a cycle in H ′.\nSince this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning\nof the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out-edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each\npebble and out-edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired.\nApplied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following.\nLemma 12 (Pebbles are the roots of trees). In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of\ncolor ci is the root of a (possibly empty) monochromatic tree-piece of color ci.\nRemark: Haas showed in [7] that in a `Tk , a subgraph induced by n′ ≥ 2 vertices with m′\nedges has exactly kn′−m′ tree-pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas’ result by extending it\nto the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree-pieces, showing the connection\nbetween the `+1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper `Tk .\nWe conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of\nthe decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors.\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\ngraphs in the decomposition.\nProof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,0)-sparse sub-\ngraphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.\nFor the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can\nspan at most n− ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game\ndecomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.\nRemark: We observe that a pebble-game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out\nof the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson’s Laman graph extraction algorithm [9]. Indeed,\npebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in\n10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nMaps-and-trees are a special case of pebble-game decompositions for tight graphs: if there\nare no cycles in ` of the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding ` pebbles must be\nspanning, since they have n− 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range\npebble-game decomposition, then the tree-pieces condition ensures that the pebble-game de-\ncomposition is a proper `Tk .\nIn the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps-\nand-trees and proper `Tk decompositions.\n7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions\nIn this section we prove the main theorems (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4), continuing the inves-\ntigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a\nminimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15\nand illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that\nthis is always possible, implying that monochromatic map-graphs are created only when we\nadd more than k(n′−1) edges to some set of n′ vertices. For the lower range, this implies that\nevery color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above\nfollows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a\nunified framework.\nIn the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi-\nfication of the add-edge move.\nCanonical add-edge: When performing an add-edge move, cover the new edge with a color\nthat is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present.\nThe second is a restriction on which pebble-slide moves we allow.\nCanonical pebble-slide: A pebble-slide move is allowed only when it does not create a\nmonochromatic cycle.\nWe call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section\nwe will show that every pebble-game graph has a canonical pebble game construction (Lemma\n14 and Lemma 15) and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper `Tk and\nmaps-and-trees decompositions (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4).\nWe begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game\nconstructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways\nfor cycles to form in the lowest ` colors.\nLemma 13 (Monochromatic cycle creation). Let v ∈ V have a pebble p of color ci on it and\nlet w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created\nin exactly one of the following ways:\n(M1) The edge vw is added with an add-edge move.\n(M2) The edge wv is reversed by a pebble-slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse\nedge vw.\nProof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7.\nBy Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a\nconnected monochromatic subgraph. (M1) and (M2) are the only ways to do this in a pebble\ngame construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or\na new pebble is put on it by a pebble-slide move.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 11\nvw vw\nFig. 5. Creating monochromatic cycles in a (2,0)-pebble game. (a) A type (M1) move creates a cycle by\nadding a black edge. (b) A type (M2) move creates a cycle with a pebble-slide move. The vertices are\nlabeled according to their role in the definition of the moves.\nFigure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show examples of (M1) and (M2) map-graph creation moves,\nrespectively, in a (2,0)-pebble game construction.\nWe next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb-\nble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases (M1) and (M2) sepa-\nrately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add-edge and canonical\npebble-slide moves.\nLemma 14 (The canonical add-edge move). Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc-\ntion. Cycle creation steps of type (M1) can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ `′, where\n`′ = min{k, `}.\nProof. For add-edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If\nthis is not possible, then there are `+1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color\nto cover the new edge.\nRemark: We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical\nadd-edge moves create cycles in the upper range.\nThe canonical pebble-slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain\nthe same class of graphs using only canonical pebble-slide moves, we need to extend Lemma\n9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that\nreorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same\nthing.\nLemma 15 (The canonical pebble-slide move). Any sequence of pebble-slide moves leading\nto an add-edge move can be replaced with one that has no (M2) steps and allows the same\nadd-edge move.\nIn other words, if it is possible to collect `+ 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added,\nthen it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles.\n12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this\nthe shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used\nin previous work on the lower range.\nFigure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an (M2) step\nat the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble-slides. Since one\napplication of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w′ to w, and a\npath from v to w′ is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the\nsequence of moves we want.\nFig. 6. Outline of the shortcut construction: (a) An arbitrary simple path from v to w with curved lines\nindicating simple paths. (b) An (M2) step. The black edge, about to be flipped, would create a cycle,\nshown in dashed and solid gray, of the (unique) gray tree rooted at w. The solid gray edges were part\nof the original path from (a). (c) The shortened path to the gray pebble; the new path follows the gray\ntree all the way from the first time the original path touched the gray tree at w′. The path from v to w′ is\nsimple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple\npath in H, and that the first move (the end of the path) is (M2). The (M2) step moves a pebble\nof color ci from a vertex w onto the edge vw, which is reversed. Because the move is (M2), v\nand w are contained in a maximal monochromatic tree of color ci. Call this tree H ′i , and observe\nthat it is rooted at w.\nNow consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make\nany of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on\nthis path in H ′i . We modify our sequence of moves as follows: delete, from the beginning, every\nmove before the one that reverses some edge yz; prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves\nthat moves the pebble on w to z in H ′i .\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 13\nFig. 7. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) an (M2) move; (b) avoiding the (M2) by moving along another path.\nThe path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines.\nFig. 8. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is\n(M2); (b) avoiding the (M2) and simplifying the path.\nSince no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated\nthe (M2) move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the\nremaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new\nsequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis.\nThe rest of the lemma follows by induction.\nTogether Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following.\nLemma 16. If G is a pebble-game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction.\nUsing canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble-game graphs\nwith maps-and-trees and `Tk graphs.\n14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\nmaps-and-trees.\nProof. As observed above, a maps-and-trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game\ndecomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps-and-trees must be a pebble-game\ngraph.\nFor the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph.\nFrom Lemma 8, we see that there are ` pebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The\ndefinition of the canonical add-edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of\neach ci for i = 1,2, . . . , `. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma\n12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree-piece with n− 1 edges, yielding\nthe required ` edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\nWe next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when\n`≥ k +1.\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper Trees-and-trees coincide with peb-\nble-game graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it\nis a proper `Tk with kn− ` edges.\nProof. As observed above, a proper `Tk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show\nis that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper `Tk .\nBy Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree-pieces and the decom-\nposition into ` edge-disjoint trees. Finally, an application of (I4), shows that every vertex must\nin in exactly k of the trees, as required.\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\nproper `Tk .\n8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions\nA naı̈ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re-\nquiring Θ(n2) time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction: in the worst case Θ(n)\napplications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring Θ(n) time each, giving a total running\ntime of Θ(n3) for the decomposition problem.\nIn this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time\nO(n2). We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.\nAlgorithm 17 (The canonical pebble game with colors).\nInput: A graph G.\nOutput: A pebble-game graph H.\nMethod:\n– Set V (H) = V (G) and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H.\n– For each edge vw ∈ E(G) try to collect at least `+1 pebbles on v and w using pebble-slide\nmoves as described by Lemma 15.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 15\n– If at least `+1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add-edge move as in Lemma\n14, otherwise discard vw.\n– Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles.\nCorrectness. Theorem 1 and the result from [24] that the sparse graphs are the independent\nsets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction\nfound is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps-\nand-trees or proper `Tk decomposition.\nComplexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to\nprocess O(n) edges added to H and O(m) edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an\nedge of G that is added to H.\nEach of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to\ndescribe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a\nsubroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this.\nAlgorithm 18 (Finding a canonical path to a pebble.).\nInput: Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H.\nOutput: If a pebble was found, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ otherwise. The configuration of H is updated.\nMethod:\n– Start by doing a depth-first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and\nreturn ‘no.’\n– Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path v = v1,e1, . . . ,ep−1,vp = u, where the vi\nare vertices and ei is the edge vivi+1. Let c[ei] be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use\nthe array c[] to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them\nand the array s[] to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each\nedge.\n– Set s[u] = ‘end′ and set c[u] to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in\nreverse order: vp,ep−1,ep−2, . . . ,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c[vi] is set; if so, go on to\nthe next i. Otherwise, check to see if c[vi+1] = c[ei].\n– If it is, set s[vi] = ei and set c[vi] = c[ei], and go on to the next edge.\n– Otherwise c[vi+1] 6= c[ei], try to find a monochromatic path in color c[vi+1] from vi to vi+1. If\na vertex x is encountered for which c[x] is set, we have a path vi = x1, f1,x2, . . . , fq−1,xq = x\nthat is monochromatic in the color of the edges; set c[xi] = c[ fi] and s[xi] = fi for i =\n1,2, . . . ,q−1. If c[x] = c[ fq−1], stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro-\nmatic c[x] path from xq−1 to x using this same procedure.\n– Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the\nsuccessor array s[v], s[s[v]], . . .\nThe correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut\nconstruction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back\nand forth, Algorithm 18 pre-computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three\ntimes: once in the initial depth-first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a\ncanonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O(n) time, for a total of O(n2) time\nspent processing edges in H.\nAlthough we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to\nmaintain components as in [12]. After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated\nin time O(n). Finally, the results of [12, 13] show that the rejected edges take an amortized O(1)\ntime each.\n16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\nSummarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom-\nposition problem in time O(n2).\n9. An important special case: Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider-pinning\nIn this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance,\nk = 2, ` = 3. As discussed in the introduction, Laman’s theorem [11] characterizes minimally\nrigid graphs as the (2,3)-tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the\ncurrent paper was submitted, we introduced the slider-pinning model of rigidity [15, 20]. Com-\nbinatorially, we model the bar-slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops\nplaced on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each\ncolor.\nWe characterize the minimally rigid bar-slider graphs [20] as graphs that are:\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\n2. (2,0)-tight when loops are included.\nWe call these graphs (2,0,3)-graded-tight, and they are a special case of the graded-sparse\ngraphs studied in our paper [14].\nThe connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following.\nCorollary 19 (Pebble games and slider-pinning). In any (2,3)-pebble game graph, if we\nreplace pebbles by loops, we obtain a (2,0,3)-graded-tight graph.\nProof. Follows from invariant (I3) of Lemma 7.\nIn [15], we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or\nhorizontal. We model the sliders as pre-colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction.\nFor this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by:\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\n2. Admit a 2-coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest (i.e., has no cycles), and each\nmonochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color.\nThis also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games.\nCorollary 20 (The pebble game with colors and slider-pinning). In any canonical (2,3)-\npebble-game-with-colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the\ngraph of a minimally pinned axis-parallel bar-slider framework.\nProof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12.\n10. Conclusions and open problems\nWe presented a new characterization of (k, `)-sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and\nused it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge-\ndisjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity-certifying decompositions in the upper range\nand runs in time O(n2), which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the\nupper range from [12].\nWe also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity-certifying decomposi-\ntion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 17\nWe defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to\neither a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-\nWilliams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer-\ntificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between\nthe `+1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of `, to matroid union augmenting\npaths, which do not apply in the upper range.\nAlgorithmic consequences and open problems. In [6], Gabow and Westermann give an O(n3/2)\nalgorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from\ndense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths,\nwhich extend a maps-and-trees decomposition. The O(n3/2) algorithm uses two subroutines to\nfind augmenting paths: cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch\nscanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths.\nWe observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester-\nmann’s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen-\ntation of the pebble game, detailed in [12, 13] are simpler and easier to implement than those\nused to support cyclic scanning.\nThe two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then:\nProblem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain\nan implementable O(n3/2) algorithm for the lower range.\nProblem 2. Extend batch scanning to the `+1 pebble condition and derive an O(n3/2) pebble\ngame algorithm for the upper range.\nIn particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm\nfor decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees.\nReferences\n1.

S. A. \n Abstract \nThe evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid \nmodel with a non-Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle \nand Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon \nsystem agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the \nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. \nThe closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, \nwhich is far beyond the Roche’s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not \nbe the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark \nmatter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 × 10-22 s-1m-1. \nThis model predicts that the Mars’s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration \nrate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. \nKey Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars \n1. Introduction \nThe popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth-Moon system is that \nthe Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the \nEarth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the \nformation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well \nknown that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth’s rotation and Moon’s \nrotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes \nbased on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The \nsituation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth-Moon \nsystem. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this \nmeans that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past.  Creationists \nargue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the \nrecessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon \nwould quickly fall inside the Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon \nwould be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence \nindicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., \nthe recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal \nfriction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of \npresent-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called “geological time scale \ndifficulty” or “Lunar crisis” and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the \ntidal friction theory (Brush 1983).  \nBut we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible \nscenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since \nits inception, the geological and physical conditions (such as the continent positions and \ndrifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial/snowball effect, etc) at \nremote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction \ncould be much less; therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various \ntidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-\nMoon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable \ndistance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray \net al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present \nrate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance \nin the response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those \ntidal friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about \ngeological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and \nmany parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time \ndependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully \nadjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those \nassumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction.  \nThe second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the \nevolution of the Earth-Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In \nthe Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, \nUniversity of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model \n(Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with \nthis model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth \nsystem can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions \nabout past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of \nthe Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the \nauthor’s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model.  \n2.  Invisible matter \nIn modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is \nabout 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently \ninvisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti-\ngravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster.   \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of \nsuch invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current \nNewtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian \nphysics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.  \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in \neverywhere of the universe (the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to \nplace); in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible \nmatter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible \nmatter if there are  interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter.  \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the \ndetection limit of the current technology; otherwise, it would be detected long time ago \nwith such dominant amount. \nWith such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the \ndark matter field fluid model with non-Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible \nmatter (dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms) is called dark matter here. \n3. The dark matter field fluid model \nIn this proposed model, it is assumed that: \n1.  A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly \nfilled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the \ncelestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property; it can \ninteract with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties; therefore, it can have \nenergy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. \n2.  The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter \nfield fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary \n“baryonic” matter;  i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter \nfield fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the \nmanner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter \nfield fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with \nthe dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the \ncelestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the \ngravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive \nforce is unknown. \nWith the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may \ninfluence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The \ncommon shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes's law, a rigid non-\npermeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds \nnumber experiences a resistance force F \nrvF πμ6−=       (1) \nwhere v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity \nconstant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the \nvelocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual \nproperties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F \nmay not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the \nmass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of \nboth fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is \nassumed to be of the scaled form \n        (2) mvrF n−−= 16πη\nwhere n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be \nviewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and η \nis the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to μ. The direction of the \nresistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force \ndescribed by Eq. 2 is velocity-dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to \nNewton's second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is \n   mvr\nm n−−= 16πη      (3) \nThen  \n       (4) )6exp( 10 vtrvv\nn−−= πη\nwhere v0 is the initial velocity (t = 0) of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a \nmassive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the \ngravitational center: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and \n(3) the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid.  The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the \norbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. \nHowever, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is \nstronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from \nthe gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is \nsufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and \ncentripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively \nslow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be \napproximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is \nGMm 2\n2 =       (5) \nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is \nthe radius of the orbit.  Inserting v of Eq.  4 into Eq. 5 yields  \n   )12exp( 1\nR n−= πη     (6) \n       (7) )12exp( 10 trRR\nn−= πη\nwhere \nR =       (8) \nR0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center.  Note that R exponentially increases \nwith time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive \nforce of dark matter field fluid.  The recessional rate of the sphere is \ndR n−= 112πη      (9) \nThe acceleration of the recession is \n   ( Rr\nRd n 21\n12 −= πη ) .     (10) \nThe recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the \ngravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. \nAccording to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating \nabout its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere \nωπμ 38 rT −=       (11) \nwhere ω is the angular velocity of the sphere.  The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is \nopposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent \ndark matter field fluid with angular velocity ω, similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted \non the sphere is \n( ) ωπη mrT n 318 −−=      (12) \nThe direction of the torque in Eq. 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The \ntorque causes the negative angular acceleration \n=       (13) \nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid \n   ( )21\n2 nrmI −=       (14) \nTherefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is \n   ωπη\nd −−= 120      (15) \nSolving this equation yields \n       (16) )20exp( 10 tr\nn−−= πηωω\nwhere ω0 is the initial angular velocity.  One can see that the angular velocity of the \nsphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to \nits angular velocity.   \nFor the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields \n     (17) \nThe significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and \nundetermined parameters; therefore, it is a critical test for this model. \nFor two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. \n15 yields \n   67.1\n1 −=−=⎟⎟\n   (18) \nThis is another critical test for this model. \n4. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model \n The Moon-Earth system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is \ncomplex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also \ninteractions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as \nan isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets \non the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is \nassumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other. \nIn addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is small enough to be ignored. The data \nabout the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994,  and Lang, 1992) are \nlisted below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may \nvary slightly with different data sources. \nMoon: \n    Mean radius:    r  = 1738.0 km \n    Mass:       m = 7.3483 × 1025 gram \n    Rotation period = 27.321661 days \n    Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 × 10-6 rad s-1 \n    Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km \n    Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1 \n    Orbit eccentricity    e = 0.0549 \n    Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 ±  0.5 arcsec century-2 \n       = (-1.255 ± 0.024) × 10-4 rad century-2\n       = (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2\n    Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 ±  0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 ±  0.02) × 10-9 m s-1 \nEarth: \n    Mean radius:    r  = 6371.0 km \n    Mass:       m = 5.9742 × 1027 gram \n    Rotation period = 23 h 56m 04.098904s = 86164.098904s \n    Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 × 10-5 rad s-1 \n    Mean distance to the Sun Rm= 149,597,870.61 km \n    Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1 \n    Angular acceleration of Earth = (-5.5 ± 0.5) × 10-22 rad s-2\nThe Moon's angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth \n(receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey \net .al., 1994). By inserting the data of the Moon's rotation and recession into Eq.  17, the \nresult is \n 039.054.1\n10662.21021.1\n1092509.31026.1\n   (19) \nThe distance R in Eq. 19 is from the Moon's center to the Earth's center and the number \n384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the Moon's surface to the Earth's surface. \nEq. 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of -1.67. The result is in accord \nwith the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of -1.54 and -\n1.67 may come from several sources: \n1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle \n2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere. \n3. The effect from Sun and other planets. \n4. Errors in data. \n5. Possible other unknown reasons. \nThe two parameters n and η in Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 can be determined with two data \nsets.  The third data set can be used to further test the model.  If this model correctly \ndescribes the situation at hand, it should give consistent results for different motions. The \nvalues of n and η calculated from three different data sets are listed below (Note, the \nmean distance of the Moon to the Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the Earth are \nused in the calculation). \n    The value of n:          n = 0.64 \n    From the Moon's rotation:   η  = 4.27 ×  10-22  s-1 m-1\n    From the Earth's rotation:     η  = 4.26 × 10-22  s-1 m-1\n    From the Moon's recession:  η = 4.64 × 10-22  s-1 m-1\nOne can see that the three values of η are consistent within the range of error in the data. \n    The average value of  η:   η = (4.39 ± 0.22) × 10-22 s-1 m-1\nBy inserting the data of the Earth's rotation, the Moon’s recession and the value of n into \nEq. 18, the result is \n14.053.1\n6371000\n1738000\n1021.11029.7\n1092509.3105.5\n)64.01(\n  (20) \nThis is also in accord with the model used here. \nThe dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field \nfluid is -1.11 × 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between \nthe Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 × 1020 N;  and the torque exerted by the dark matter field \nfluid on the Earth’s and the Moon's rotations is T = -5.49 × 1016 Nm and -1.15 × 1012 Nm, \nrespectively.  \n5. The evolution of Earth-Moon system \nSonett  et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was \nabout 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al., \n1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day \nwas about 19.2 hours, this agrees very well with Sonett et al.'s result.   \nAnother critical aspect of modeling the evolution of the Earth-Moon system is to  \ngive a reasonable estimate of the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth when the \nsystem was established at 4.5 billion years ago. Based on the dark matter field fluid \nmodel, and the above result, the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth was about \n259000 km (center to center) or 250900 km (surface to surface) at 4.5 billion years ago, \nthis is far beyond the Roche's limit. In the modern astronomy textbook by Chaisson and \nMcMillan (Chaisson and McMillan, 1993, p.173), the estimated distance at 4.5 billion \nyears ago was 250000 km, this is probably the most reasonable number that most \nastronomers believe and it agrees excellently with the result of this model. The closest \ndistance of the Moon to the Earth by Hansen’s models was about 38 Earth radii or \n242000 km (Hansen, 1982).  \nAccording to this model, the length of day of the Earth was about 8 hours at 4.5 \nbillion years ago. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the \nlength of day of the Earth with the age of the Earth-Moon system described by this model \nalong with data from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One \ncan see that those data fit this model very well in their time range.  \nFig. 2 shows the geological data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from \nSonett et al. (1996) and the description (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model \nfor past 900 million years. One can see that the model agrees with the geological and \nfossil data beautifully.  \nThe important difference of this model with early models in describing the early \nevolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this model is based only on current data of the \nMoon-Earth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth \nrotation and continental drifting. Based on this model, the Earth-Moon system has been \nsmoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate \nof the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description does not take it into \naccount that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly \nsignificant changes in the motions of the Earth and the Moon, such as strong impacts by \ngiant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very common in the universe. \nThe general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model \nagrees with geological evidence. Based on Eq. 9, the recessional rate exponentially \nincreases with time. One may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become \nvery large.  The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be \n3.04 × 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 × 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years. \nHowever, whether the Moon's recession will continue or at some time later another \nmechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction \ndoes affect the evolution of the Earth itself such as the surface crust structure, continental \ndrifting and evolution of bio-system, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earth’s \nrotation, however, such role is not a dominant mechanism.  \nUnfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital \nmotion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results, \nthe recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 × 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km \ncentury-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is \n-1.8 × 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of the Sun and the stable environment on \nthe Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length \nof the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as \nsome other evidences) suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the \nyear over the billion years and the Earth's orbital motion is more stable than its rotation.  \nThis suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same \ndirection and similar speed of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital range). Therefore, the \nEarth's orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter \nfield fluid. However, this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify \nif this is the case.  \n6. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars \nThe Moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface, even there is no air, therefore, \nthere is no ocean-like tidal friction force to slow its rotation; however, the rotation of the \nMoon is still slowing at significant rate of (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2,  which agrees \nwith the model very well. Based on this, one may reasonably think that the Mars’s \nrotation should be slowing also. \nThe Mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted human’s great attention \nsince ancient time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades. \nNASA, Russian and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect \ndata and study this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about the \nhistory of this planet to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth, the Mars rotates about \nits central axis and revolves around the Sun, however, the Mars does not have a massive \nmoon circulating it (Mars has two small satellites: Phobos and Deimos) and there is no \nliquid fluid on its surface, therefore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal friction force to \nslow its rotation by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and current the \nMars's data, this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the Mars should be about \n-4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the \nsolar days/Mars year, the vertical dash line marks the current age of the Mars with \nassumption that the Mars was formed in a similar time period of the Earth formation. \nSuch description was not given before according to the author’s knowledge and is \ncompletely skeptical due to lack of reliable data.  However, with further expansion of the \nresearch and exploration on the Mars, we shall feel confident that the reliable data about \nthe angular rotation acceleration of the Mars will be available in the near future which \nwill provide a vital test for the prediction of this model. There are also other factors \nwhich may affect the Mars’s rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season \nchange, winds, possible volcano eruptions and Mars quakes. Therefore, the data has to be \ncarefully analyzed. \n7.  Discussion about the model \nFrom the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the \ngeological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the \nEarth-Moon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional \nparameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and \nreceding (Eq.  17 and Eq.  18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in \nthe same gravitational system, such relationship is not known before. Such success can \nnot be explained by “coincidence” or “luck” because of so many data involved (current \nEarth’s and Moon’s data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is just a \n“ad hoc” or a wrong model, although the chance for the natural happening of such \n“coincidence” or “luck” could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery; the future Mars’s \ndata will clarify this; otherwise, a new theory from different approach can be developed \nto give the same or better description as this model does. It is certain that this model is \nnot perfect and may have defects, further development may be conducted. \nJames Clark Maxwell said in the 1873 “ The vast interplanetary and interstellar \nregions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has \nnot seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find \nthem to be already full of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human power can \nremove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite \ncontinuity. It extends unbroken from star to star ….” The medium that Maxwell talked \nabout is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The \nMichelson-Morley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not \ndepend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar \nspace. In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically \nrecently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The dark matter field \nfluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and “precisely” described by Maxwell. \n7. Conclusion \nThe evolution of the Earth-Moon system can be described by the dark matter field \nfluid model with non-Newtonian approach and the current data of the Earth and the Moon \nfits this model very well. At 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the \nEarth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Roche’s limit and the length of \nday was about 8 hours. The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system \ndescribed by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may \nnot be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The Mars’s rotation \nis also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. \nReferences \nS. G. Brush, 1983.   L. R.

Since the \nformation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well \nknown that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth’s rotation and Moon’s \nrotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes \nbased on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The \nsituation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth-Moon \nsystem. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this \nmeans that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past.  Creationists \nargue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the \nrecessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon \nwould quickly fall inside the Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon \nwould be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence \nindicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., \nthe recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal \nfriction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of \npresent-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called “geological time scale \ndifficulty” or “Lunar crisis” and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the \ntidal friction theory (Brush 1983).  \nBut we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible \nscenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since \nits inception, the geological and physical conditions (such as the continent positions and \ndrifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial/snowball effect, etc) at \nremote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction \ncould be much less; therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various \ntidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-\nMoon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable \ndistance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray \net al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present \nrate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance \nin the response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those \ntidal friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about \ngeological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and \nmany parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time \ndependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully \nadjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those \nassumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction.  \nThe second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the \nevolution of the Earth-Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In \nthe Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, \nUniversity of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model \n(Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with \nthis model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth \nsystem can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions \nabout past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of \nthe Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the \nauthor’s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model.  \n2.  Invisible matter \nIn modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is \nabout 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently \ninvisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti-\ngravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster.   \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of \nsuch invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current \nNewtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian \nphysics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.  \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in \neverywhere of the universe (the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to \nplace); in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible \nmatter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible \nmatter if there are  interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter.  \nIf the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, \nthen, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the \ndetection limit of the current technology; otherwise, it would be detected long time ago \nwith such dominant amount. \nWith such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the \ndark matter field fluid model with non-Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible \nmatter (dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms) is called dark matter here. \n3. The dark matter field fluid model \nIn this proposed model, it is assumed that: \n1.  A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly \nfilled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the \ncelestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property; it can \ninteract with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties; therefore, it can have \nenergy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. \n2.  The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter \nfield fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary \n“baryonic” matter;  i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter \nfield fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the \nmanner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter \nfield fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with \nthe dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the \ncelestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the \ngravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive \nforce is unknown. \nWith the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may \ninfluence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The \ncommon shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes's law, a rigid non-\npermeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds \nnumber experiences a resistance force F \nrvF πμ6−=       (1) \nwhere v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity \nconstant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the \nvelocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual \nproperties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F \nmay not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the \nmass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of \nboth fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is \nassumed to be of the scaled form \n        (2) mvrF n−−= 16πη\nwhere n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be \nviewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and η \nis the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to μ. The direction of the \nresistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force \ndescribed by Eq. 2 is velocity-dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to \nNewton's second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is \n   mvr\nm n−−= 16πη      (3) \nThen  \n       (4) )6exp( 10 vtrvv\nn−−= πη\nwhere v0 is the initial velocity (t = 0) of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a \nmassive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the \ngravitational center: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and \n(3) the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid.  The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the \norbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. \nHowever, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is \nstronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from \nthe gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is \nsufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and \ncentripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively \nslow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be \napproximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is \nGMm 2\n2 =       (5) \nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is \nthe radius of the orbit.  Inserting v of Eq.  4 into Eq. 5 yields  \n   )12exp( 1\nR n−= πη     (6) \n       (7) )12exp( 10 trRR\nn−= πη\nwhere \nR =       (8) \nR0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center.  Note that R exponentially increases \nwith time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive \nforce of dark matter field fluid.  The recessional rate of the sphere is \ndR n−= 112πη      (9) \nThe acceleration of the recession is \n   ( Rr\nRd n 21\n12 −= πη ) .     (10) \nThe recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the \ngravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. \nAccording to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating \nabout its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere \nωπμ 38 rT −=       (11) \nwhere ω is the angular velocity of the sphere.  The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is \nopposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent \ndark matter field fluid with angular velocity ω, similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted \non the sphere is \n( ) ωπη mrT n 318 −−=      (12) \nThe direction of the torque in Eq. 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The \ntorque causes the negative angular acceleration \n=       (13) \nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid \n   ( )21\n2 nrmI −=       (14) \nTherefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is \n   ωπη\nd −−= 120      (15) \nSolving this equation yields \n       (16) )20exp( 10 tr\nn−−= πηωω\nwhere ω0 is the initial angular velocity.  One can see that the angular velocity of the \nsphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to \nits angular velocity.   \nFor the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields \n     (17) \nThe significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and \nundetermined parameters; therefore, it is a critical test for this model. \nFor two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. \n15 yields \n   67.1\n1 −=−=⎟⎟\n   (18) \nThis is another critical test for this model. \n4. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model \n The Moon-Earth system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is \ncomplex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also \ninteractions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as \nan isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets \non the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is \nassumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other. \nIn addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is small enough to be ignored. The data \nabout the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994,  and Lang, 1992) are \nlisted below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may \nvary slightly with different data sources. \nMoon: \n    Mean radius:    r  = 1738.0 km \n    Mass:       m = 7.3483 × 1025 gram \n    Rotation period = 27.321661 days \n    Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 × 10-6 rad s-1 \n    Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km \n    Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1 \n    Orbit eccentricity    e = 0.0549 \n    Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 ±  0.5 arcsec century-2 \n       = (-1.255 ± 0.024) × 10-4 rad century-2\n       = (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2\n    Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 ±  0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 ±  0.02) × 10-9 m s-1 \nEarth: \n    Mean radius:    r  = 6371.0 km \n    Mass:       m = 5.9742 × 1027 gram \n    Rotation period = 23 h 56m 04.098904s = 86164.098904s \n    Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 × 10-5 rad s-1 \n    Mean distance to the Sun Rm= 149,597,870.61 km \n    Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1 \n    Angular acceleration of Earth = (-5.5 ± 0.5) × 10-22 rad s-2\nThe Moon's angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth \n(receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey \net .al., 1994). By inserting the data of the Moon's rotation and recession into Eq.  17, the \nresult is \n 039.054.1\n10662.21021.1\n1092509.31026.1\n   (19) \nThe distance R in Eq. 19 is from the Moon's center to the Earth's center and the number \n384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the Moon's surface to the Earth's surface. \nEq. 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of -1.67. The result is in accord \nwith the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of -1.54 and -\n1.67 may come from several sources: \n1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle \n2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere. \n3. The effect from Sun and other planets. \n4. Errors in data. \n5. Possible other unknown reasons. \nThe two parameters n and η in Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 can be determined with two data \nsets.  The third data set can be used to further test the model.  If this model correctly \ndescribes the situation at hand, it should give consistent results for different motions. The \nvalues of n and η calculated from three different data sets are listed below (Note, the \nmean distance of the Moon to the Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the Earth are \nused in the calculation). \n    The value of n:          n = 0.64 \n    From the Moon's rotation:   η  = 4.27 ×  10-22  s-1 m-1\n    From the Earth's rotation:     η  = 4.26 × 10-22  s-1 m-1\n    From the Moon's recession:  η = 4.64 × 10-22  s-1 m-1\nOne can see that the three values of η are consistent within the range of error in the data. \n    The average value of  η:   η = (4.39 ± 0.22) × 10-22 s-1 m-1\nBy inserting the data of the Earth's rotation, the Moon’s recession and the value of n into \nEq. 18, the result is \n14.053.1\n6371000\n1738000\n1021.11029.7\n1092509.3105.5\n)64.01(\n  (20) \nThis is also in accord with the model used here. \nThe dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field \nfluid is -1.11 × 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between \nthe Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 × 1020 N;  and the torque exerted by the dark matter field \nfluid on the Earth’s and the Moon's rotations is T = -5.49 × 1016 Nm and -1.15 × 1012 Nm, \nrespectively.  \n5. The evolution of Earth-Moon system \nSonett  et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was \nabout 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al., \n1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day \nwas about 19.2 hours, this agrees very well with Sonett et al.'s result.   \nAnother critical aspect of modeling the evolution of the Earth-Moon system is to  \ngive a reasonable estimate of the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth when the \nsystem was established at 4.5 billion years ago. Based on the dark matter field fluid \nmodel, and the above result, the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth was about \n259000 km (center to center) or 250900 km (surface to surface) at 4.5 billion years ago, \nthis is far beyond the Roche's limit. In the modern astronomy textbook by Chaisson and \nMcMillan (Chaisson and McMillan, 1993, p.173), the estimated distance at 4.5 billion \nyears ago was 250000 km, this is probably the most reasonable number that most \nastronomers believe and it agrees excellently with the result of this model. The closest \ndistance of the Moon to the Earth by Hansen’s models was about 38 Earth radii or \n242000 km (Hansen, 1982).  \nAccording to this model, the length of day of the Earth was about 8 hours at 4.5 \nbillion years ago. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the \nlength of day of the Earth with the age of the Earth-Moon system described by this model \nalong with data from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One \ncan see that those data fit this model very well in their time range.  \nFig. 2 shows the geological data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from \nSonett et al. (1996) and the description (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model \nfor past 900 million years. One can see that the model agrees with the geological and \nfossil data beautifully.  \nThe important difference of this model with early models in describing the early \nevolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this model is based only on current data of the \nMoon-Earth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth \nrotation and continental drifting. Based on this model, the Earth-Moon system has been \nsmoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate \nof the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description does not take it into \naccount that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly \nsignificant changes in the motions of the Earth and the Moon, such as strong impacts by \ngiant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very common in the universe. \nThe general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model \nagrees with geological evidence. Based on Eq. 9, the recessional rate exponentially \nincreases with time. One may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become \nvery large.  The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be \n3.04 × 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 × 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years. \nHowever, whether the Moon's recession will continue or at some time later another \nmechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction \ndoes affect the evolution of the Earth itself such as the surface crust structure, continental \ndrifting and evolution of bio-system, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earth’s \nrotation, however, such role is not a dominant mechanism.  \nUnfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital \nmotion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results, \nthe recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 × 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km \ncentury-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is \n-1.8 × 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of the Sun and the stable environment on \nthe Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length \nof the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as \nsome other evidences) suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the \nyear over the billion years and the Earth's orbital motion is more stable than its rotation.  \nThis suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same \ndirection and similar speed of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital range). Therefore, the \nEarth's orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter \nfield fluid. However, this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify \nif this is the case.  \n6. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars \nThe Moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface, even there is no air, therefore, \nthere is no ocean-like tidal friction force to slow its rotation; however, the rotation of the \nMoon is still slowing at significant rate of (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2,  which agrees \nwith the model very well. Based on this, one may reasonably think that the Mars’s \nrotation should be slowing also. \nThe Mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted human’s great attention \nsince ancient time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades. \nNASA, Russian and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect \ndata and study this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about the \nhistory of this planet to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth, the Mars rotates about \nits central axis and revolves around the Sun, however, the Mars does not have a massive \nmoon circulating it (Mars has two small satellites: Phobos and Deimos) and there is no \nliquid fluid on its surface, therefore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal friction force to \nslow its rotation by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and current the \nMars's data, this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the Mars should be about \n-4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the \nsolar days/Mars year, the vertical dash line marks the current age of the Mars with \nassumption that the Mars was formed in a similar time period of the Earth formation. \nSuch description was not given before according to the author’s knowledge and is \ncompletely skeptical due to lack of reliable data.  However, with further expansion of the \nresearch and exploration on the Mars, we shall feel confident that the reliable data about \nthe angular rotation acceleration of the Mars will be available in the near future which \nwill provide a vital test for the prediction of this model. There are also other factors \nwhich may affect the Mars’s rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season \nchange, winds, possible volcano eruptions and Mars quakes. Therefore, the data has to be \ncarefully analyzed. \n7.  Discussion about the model \nFrom the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the \ngeological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the \nEarth-Moon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional \nparameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and \nreceding (Eq.  17 and Eq.  18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in \nthe same gravitational system, such relationship is not known before. Such success can \nnot be explained by “coincidence” or “luck” because of so many data involved (current \nEarth’s and Moon’s data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is just a \n“ad hoc” or a wrong model, although the chance for the natural happening of such \n“coincidence” or “luck” could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery; the future Mars’s \ndata will clarify this; otherwise, a new theory from different approach can be developed \nto give the same or better description as this model does. It is certain that this model is \nnot perfect and may have defects, further development may be conducted. \nJames Clark Maxwell said in the 1873 “ The vast interplanetary and interstellar \nregions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has \nnot seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find \nthem to be already full of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human power can \nremove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite \ncontinuity. It extends unbroken from star to star ….” The medium that Maxwell talked \nabout is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The \nMichelson-Morley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not \ndepend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar \nspace. In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically \nrecently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The dark matter field \nfluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and “precisely” described by Maxwell. \n7. Conclusion \nThe evolution of the Earth-Moon system can be described by the dark matter field \nfluid model with non-Newtonian approach and the current data of the Earth and the Moon \nfits this model very well. At 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the \nEarth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Roche’s limit and the length of \nday was about 8 hours. The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system \ndescribed by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may \nnot be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The Mars’s rotation \nis also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. \nReferences \nS. G. Brush, 1983.   L. R.

Solid lines are calculated according to the dark matter \nfield fluid model. Data sources: the Moon distances are from Kvale and et al. and for the \nlength of day: (a and b) are from Scrutton ( page 186, fig. 8), c is from Sonett and et al.  \nThe dash line marks the current age of the Earth-Moon system.  \nFigure 2, the evolution of Solar days of year with the age of the Earth-Moon \nsystem. The solid line is calculated according to dark matter field fluid model. The data \nare from Wells (3.9 ~ 4.435 billion years range), Sonett (3.6 billion years) and current \nage (4.5 billion years). \nFigure 3, the skeptical description of the evolution of Mars’s length of day and the \nsolar days/Mars year with the age of the Mars (assuming that the Mars’s age is about 4.5 \nbillion years).

Abstract. We describe a new algorithm, the (k, `)-pebble game with colors, and use it to obtain a charac-
terization of the family of (k, `)-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concern-
ing tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen
the previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characteri-
zation of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the (k, `)-pebble
game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous
sparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9].
1. Introduction and preliminaries
The focus of this paper is decompositions of (k, `)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs
that certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a
graph is (k, `)-sparse if no subset of n′ vertices spans more than kn′− ` edges in the graph; a
(k, `)-sparse graph with kn′− ` edges is (k, `)-tight. We call the range k ≤ `≤ 2k−1 the upper
range of sparse graphs and 0≤ `≤ k the lower range.
In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity
in the upper range of `. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad-
dressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs
and graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.
Our algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the
pebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that
produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.
We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to
previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide
a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-
Tutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the
properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].
Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the
matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in

the upper range. Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening
of augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs.
1.1. Sparse graphs
A graph is (k, `)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m′ edges and n′ vertices, m′ ≤
kn′− `. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤ ` ≤ 2k− 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn−` edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V,E), and V ′ ⊂ V , we use the notation span(V ′) for the number of edges
in the subgraph induced by V ′. In a directed graph, out(V ′) is the number of edges with the tail
in V ′ and the head in V −V ′; for a subgraph induced by V ′, we call such an edge an out-edge.
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.
1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions
A k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Figure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described
by the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k,k)-tight
graphs.
A map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is
exactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint map-
graphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible
configuration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently
defined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1
A (k, `)-maps-and-trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k− ` edge-disjoint
map-graphs and ` spanning trees.
Another characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as
the (1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. The k-map-graphs are evidently (k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that
the converse holds as well.
1 Our terminology follows Lovász in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases
of the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3

(2,1)-maps-and-trees. Edges with the same line style belong to the same subgraph. The 2-map-graph is
shown with a certifying orientation.
A `Tk is a decomposition into ` edge-disjoint (not necessarily spanning) trees such that each
vertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2(a) shows an example of a 3T2.
Given a subgraph G′ of a `Tk graph G, the set of tree-pieces in G′ is the collection of the
components of the trees in G induced by G′ (since G′ is a subgraph each tree may contribute
multiple pieces to the set of tree-pieces in G′). We observe that these tree-pieces may come
from the same tree or be single-vertex “empty trees.” It is also helpful to note that the definition
of a tree-piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An `Tk decomposition is proper if the set of
tree-pieces in any subgraph G′ has size at least `.
Figure 2(a) shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition; we note that one of the trees is an
isolated vertex in the bottom-right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2(b) has three black tree-
pieces and one gray tree-piece: an isolated vertex at the top-right corner, and two single edges.
These count as three tree-pieces, even though they come from the same back tree when the
whole graph in considered. Figure 2(c) shows another subgraph; in this case there are three
gray tree-pieces and one black one.
Table 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper.
The decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak-
ing a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar-
sity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper `Tk decompositions;
and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.
2. Historical background
The well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k,k)-tight graphs to
the existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,

corner. (b) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree-pieces and one gray
tree-piece. (c) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree-pieces (one is a
single vertex) and one black tree-piece.
Edmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps-
and-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and
matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].
In rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman [11] shows that (2,3)-tight (Laman)
graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. Tay
[21] proved an analogous result for body-bar frameworks in any dimension using (k,k)-tight
graphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo [2] proved the
equivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay [22] used this condition to give a
direct proof of Laman’s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all `Tk for k≤ `≤ 2k−1.
Haas [7] studied `Tk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and
proper `Tk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble-
game-with-colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of
sparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation [11, 21, 22, 24].
A pebble game algorithm was first proposed in [10] as an elegant alternative to Hendrick-
son’s Laman graph algorithms [9]. Berg and Jordan [1], provided the formal analysis of the
pebble game of [10] and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and
Streinu [12] generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0≤ `≤ 2k−1, and
left as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions.
3. The pebble game with colors
Our pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative
integers k and `. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm
for the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase “with colors” is necessary
only for comparison to [12], we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 5
We now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a
fixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves; a move consists in the
addition and/or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured
by a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored
by the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the
notation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w.
We describe the pebble game with colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed
moves.
Fig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves: (a) add-edge. (b) pebble-slide. Pebbles on vertices
are shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them.
Initialization: In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start
by placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for i = 1,2, . . . ,k.
Add-edge-with-colors: Let v and w be vertices with at least `+1 pebbles on them. Assume
(w.l.o.g.) that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw
to E(H) and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge.
Figure 3(a) shows examples of the add-edge move.
Pebble-slide: Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace
vw with wv in E(H); put the pebble that was on vw on v; and put p on wv.
Note that the color of an edge can change with a pebble-slide move. Figure 3(b) shows
examples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices
are represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them.
From the definition of the pebble-slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is
always either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However,
when making a sequence of pebble-slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is
sometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end
of the path to the beginning.
The output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration.
Output: At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location
and colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble
game configuration colors the edges.
We say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the (k, `)-pebble game
or that H is a pebble-game graph.
Since each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game’s configuration partitions
the edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble-
game-with-colors decomposition. Figure 4(a) shows an example of a (2,2)-tight graph with a
pebble-game decomposition.
Let G = (V,E) be pebble-game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges,
and let G′ be a subgraph of G. Then the coloring of G induces a set of monochromatic con-

nected subgraphs of G′ (there may be more than one of the same color). Such a monochromatic
subgraph is called a map-graph-piece of G′ if it contains a cycle (in G′) and a tree-piece of G′
otherwise. The set of tree-pieces of G′ is the collection of tree-pieces induced by G′. As with
the corresponding definition for `Tk s, the set of tree-pieces is defined relative to a specific sub-
graph; in particular a tree-piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned
by G′.
The properties of pebble-game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2
shows that each color must be (1,0)-sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4(a) shows
this.
For example Figure 4(a) shows a (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decom-
position. The whole graph contains a gray tree-piece and a black tree-piece that is an isolated
vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4(b) has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black
tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4(c), however, the black cycle does not
contribute a tree-piece. All three tree-pieces in this subgraph are single-vertex gray trees.
In the following discussion, we use the notation peb(v) for the number of pebbles on v and
pebi(v) to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v.
Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper.
4. Our Results
We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 7
Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of [12] to include colors. It says
that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games
discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly.
Theorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse
with 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.
Next we consider pebble-game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of
proper `Tk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.
Theorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game
graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each
is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse
graphs in the decomposition.
The (1,0)-sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles; thus
Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble-game-with-colors decompositions obtained
by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the
requirement that the set of tree-pieces have size at least ` in Theorem 2 and the definition of a
proper `Tk .
Our next results show that for any pebble-game graph, we can specialize its pebble game
construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk . We call these
specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc-
tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results.
We observe Theorem 2 that maps-and-trees are special cases of the pebble-game decompo-
sition: both spanning trees and spanning map-graphs are (1,0)-sparse, and each of the spanning
trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph.
The case of proper `Tk graphs is more subtle; if each color in a pebble-game decomposition
is a forest, then we have found a proper `Tk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper
`Tk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper `Tk decompositions is
sufficient to certify sparsity.
We now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range.
Theorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-
maps-and-trees.
Theorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper `Tk graphs coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it is a proper
`Tk with kn− ` edges.
As corollaries, we obtain the existing decomposition results for sparse graphs.
Corollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph
G is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.
Corollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a
proper `Tk .
Efficiently finding canonical pebble game constructions. The proofs of Theorem 3 and Theo-
rem 4 lead to an obvious algorithm with O(n3) running time for the decomposition problem.
Our last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus
8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in
O(n2) time and space.
These time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of [12]
without any change in complexity.
5. Pebble game graphs
In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from [12] to the pebble game
with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over
directly from the pebble games of [12], we refer the reader there for the proofs.
We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game.
Lemma 7 (Pebble game invariants). During the execution of the pebble game, the following
invariants are maintained in H:
(I1) There are at least ` pebbles on V . [12]
(I2) For each vertex v, span(v)+out(v)+peb(v) = k. [12]
(I3) For each V ′ ⊂V , span(V ′)+out(V ′)+peb(V ′) = kn′. [12]
(I4) For every vertex v ∈V , outi(v)+pebi(v) = 1.
(I5) Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with
a pebble of color ci or a cycle.
Proof. (I1), (I2), and (I3) come directly from [12].
(I4) This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors.
That add-edge and pebble-slide moves preserve (I4) is clear from inspection.
(I5) By (I4), a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of
the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually
visit some vertex twice.
From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse.
Lemma 8 (Pebble-game graphs are sparse [12]). Let H be a graph constructed with the
pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly ` pebbles on V (H), then H is tight.
The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble-game graph is the following.
Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble-slide moves to reduce
the out degree of v by one.
Lemma 9 (The `+1 pebble condition [12]). Let vw be an edge such that H + vw is sparse. If
peb({v,w}) &lt; `+1, then a pebble not on {v,w} can be brought to either v or w.
It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.
Theorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse
with 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.
6. The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition
In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We
start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components
in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 9
Lemma 10 (Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse). Let Hi be the sub-
graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is (1,0)-sparse, for
i = 1, . . . ,k.
Proof. By (I4) Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex.
Lemma 11 (Tree-pieces in a pebble-game graph). Every subgraph of the directed graph H
in a pebble game construction contains at least ` monochromatic tree-pieces, and each of these
is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge.
Recall that an out-edge from a subgraph H ′ = (V ′,E ′) is an edge vw with v∈V ′ and vw /∈ E ′.
Proof. Let H ′ = (V ′,E ′) be a non-empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality
that H ′ is induced by V ′. By (I3), out(V ′)+ peb(V ′) ≥ `. We will show that each pebble and
out-edge tail is the root of a tree-piece.
Consider a vertex v ∈ V ′ and a color ci. By (I4) there is a unique monochromatic directed
path of color ci starting at v. By (I5), if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle.
Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge also in color ci (i.e., if the
monochromatic path from v leaves V ′), then the path cannot have a cycle in H ′.
Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning
of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out-edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each
pebble and out-edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired.
Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following.
Lemma 12 (Pebbles are the roots of trees). In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of
color ci is the root of a (possibly empty) monochromatic tree-piece of color ci.
Remark: Haas showed in [7] that in a `Tk , a subgraph induced by n′ ≥ 2 vertices with m′
edges has exactly kn′−m′ tree-pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas’ result by extending it
to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree-pieces, showing the connection
between the `+1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper `Tk .
We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of
the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors.
Theorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game
graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each
is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse
graphs in the decomposition.
Proof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,0)-sparse sub-
graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.
For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can
span at most n− ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game
decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.
Remark: We observe that a pebble-game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out
of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson’s Laman graph extraction algorithm [9]. Indeed,
pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in
10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Maps-and-trees are a special case of pebble-game decompositions for tight graphs: if there
are no cycles in ` of the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding ` pebbles must be
spanning, since they have n− 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range
pebble-game decomposition, then the tree-pieces condition ensures that the pebble-game de-
composition is a proper `Tk .
In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps-
and-trees and proper `Tk decompositions.
7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions
In this section we prove the main theorems (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4), continuing the inves-
tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a
minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15
and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that
this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map-graphs are created only when we
add more than k(n′−1) edges to some set of n′ vertices. For the lower range, this implies that
every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above
follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a
unified framework.
In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi-
fication of the add-edge move.
Canonical add-edge: When performing an add-edge move, cover the new edge with a color
that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present.
The second is a restriction on which pebble-slide moves we allow.
Canonical pebble-slide: A pebble-slide move is allowed only when it does not create a
monochromatic cycle.
We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section
we will show that every pebble-game graph has a canonical pebble game construction (Lemma
14 and Lemma 15) and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper `Tk and
maps-and-trees decompositions (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4).
We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game
constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways
for cycles to form in the lowest ` colors.
Lemma 13 (Monochromatic cycle creation). Let v ∈ V have a pebble p of color ci on it and
let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created
in exactly one of the following ways:
(M1) The edge vw is added with an add-edge move.
(M2) The edge wv is reversed by a pebble-slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse
edge vw.
Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7.
By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a
connected monochromatic subgraph. (M1) and (M2) are the only ways to do this in a pebble
game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or
a new pebble is put on it by a pebble-slide move.

adding a black edge. (b) A type (M2) move creates a cycle with a pebble-slide move. The vertices are
labeled according to their role in the definition of the moves.
Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show examples of (M1) and (M2) map-graph creation moves,
respectively, in a (2,0)-pebble game construction.
We next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb-
ble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases (M1) and (M2) sepa-
rately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add-edge and canonical
pebble-slide moves.
Lemma 14 (The canonical add-edge move). Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc-
tion. Cycle creation steps of type (M1) can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ `′, where
`′ = min{k, `}.
Proof. For add-edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If
this is not possible, then there are `+1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color
to cover the new edge.
Remark: We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical
add-edge moves create cycles in the upper range.
The canonical pebble-slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain
the same class of graphs using only canonical pebble-slide moves, we need to extend Lemma
9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that
reorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same
thing.
Lemma 15 (The canonical pebble-slide move). Any sequence of pebble-slide moves leading
to an add-edge move can be replaced with one that has no (M2) steps and allows the same
add-edge move.
In other words, if it is possible to collect `+ 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added,
then it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles.

Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this
the shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used
in previous work on the lower range.
Figure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an (M2) step
at the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble-slides. Since one
application of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w′ to w, and a
path from v to w′ is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the
sequence of moves we want.

indicating simple paths. (b) An (M2) step. The black edge, about to be flipped, would create a cycle,

tree all the way from the first time the original path touched the gray tree at w′. The path from v to w′ is
simple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple
path in H, and that the first move (the end of the path) is (M2). The (M2) step moves a pebble
of color ci from a vertex w onto the edge vw, which is reversed. Because the move is (M2), v
and w are contained in a maximal monochromatic tree of color ci. Call this tree H ′i , and observe
that it is rooted at w.
Now consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make
any of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on
this path in H ′i . We modify our sequence of moves as follows: delete, from the beginning, every
move before the one that reverses some edge yz; prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves
that moves the pebble on w to z in H ′i .

The path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines.
Fig. 8. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is
(M2); (b) avoiding the (M2) and simplifying the path.
Since no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated
the (M2) move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the
remaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new
sequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis.
The rest of the lemma follows by induction.
Together Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following.
Lemma 16. If G is a pebble-game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction.
Using canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble-game graphs
with maps-and-trees and `Tk graphs.
14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Theorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-
maps-and-trees.
Proof. As observed above, a maps-and-trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game
decomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps-and-trees must be a pebble-game
graph.
For the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph.
From Lemma 8, we see that there are ` pebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The
definition of the canonical add-edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of
each ci for i = 1,2, . . . , `. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma
12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree-piece with n− 1 edges, yielding
the required ` edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Corollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph
G is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.
We next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when
`≥ k +1.
Theorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper Trees-and-trees coincide with peb-
ble-game graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it
is a proper `Tk with kn− ` edges.
Proof. As observed above, a proper `Tk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show
is that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper `Tk .
By Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree-pieces and the decom-
position into ` edge-disjoint trees. Finally, an application of (I4), shows that every vertex must
in in exactly k of the trees, as required.
Corollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a
proper `Tk .
8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions
A naı̈ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re-
quiring Θ(n2) time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction: in the worst case Θ(n)
applications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring Θ(n) time each, giving a total running
time of Θ(n3) for the decomposition problem.
In this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time
O(n2). We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.
Algorithm 17 (The canonical pebble game with colors).
Input: A graph G.
Output: A pebble-game graph H.
Method:
– Set V (H) = V (G) and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H.
– For each edge vw ∈ E(G) try to collect at least `+1 pebbles on v and w using pebble-slide
moves as described by Lemma 15.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 15
– If at least `+1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add-edge move as in Lemma
14, otherwise discard vw.
– Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles.
Correctness. Theorem 1 and the result from [24] that the sparse graphs are the independent
sets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction
found is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps-
and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition.
Complexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to
process O(n) edges added to H and O(m) edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an
edge of G that is added to H.
Each of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to
describe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a
subroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this.
Algorithm 18 (Finding a canonical path to a pebble.).
Input: Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H.
Output: If a pebble was found, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ otherwise. The configuration of H is updated.
Method:
– Start by doing a depth-first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and
return ‘no.’
– Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path v = v1,e1, . . . ,ep−1,vp = u, where the vi
are vertices and ei is the edge vivi+1. Let c[ei] be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use
the array c[] to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them
and the array s[] to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each
edge.
– Set s[u] = ‘end′ and set c[u] to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in
reverse order: vp,ep−1,ep−2, . . . ,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c[vi] is set; if so, go on to
the next i. Otherwise, check to see if c[vi+1] = c[ei].
– If it is, set s[vi] = ei and set c[vi] = c[ei], and go on to the next edge.
– Otherwise c[vi+1] 6= c[ei], try to find a monochromatic path in color c[vi+1] from vi to vi+1. If
a vertex x is encountered for which c[x] is set, we have a path vi = x1, f1,x2, . . . , fq−1,xq = x
that is monochromatic in the color of the edges; set c[xi] = c[ fi] and s[xi] = fi for i =
1,2, . . . ,q−1. If c[x] = c[ fq−1], stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro-
matic c[x] path from xq−1 to x using this same procedure.
– Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the
successor array s[v], s[s[v]], . . .
The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut
construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back
and forth, Algorithm 18 pre-computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three
times: once in the initial depth-first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a
canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O(n) time, for a total of O(n2) time
spent processing edges in H.
Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to
maintain components as in [12]. After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated
in time O(n). Finally, the results of [12, 13] show that the rejected edges take an amortized O(1)
time each.
16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom-
position problem in time O(n2).
9. An important special case: Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider-pinning
In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance,
k = 2, ` = 3. As discussed in the introduction, Laman’s theorem [11] characterizes minimally
rigid graphs as the (2,3)-tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the
current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider-pinning model of rigidity [15, 20]. Com-
binatorially, we model the bar-slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops
placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each
color.
We characterize the minimally rigid bar-slider graphs [20] as graphs that are:
1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.
2. (2,0)-tight when loops are included.
We call these graphs (2,0,3)-graded-tight, and they are a special case of the graded-sparse
graphs studied in our paper [14].
The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following.
Corollary 19 (Pebble games and slider-pinning). In any (2,3)-pebble game graph, if we
replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a (2,0,3)-graded-tight graph.
Proof. Follows from invariant (I3) of Lemma 7.
In [15], we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or
horizontal. We model the sliders as pre-colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction.
For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by:
1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.
2. Admit a 2-coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest (i.e., has no cycles), and each
monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color.
This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games.
Corollary 20 (The pebble game with colors and slider-pinning). In any canonical (2,3)-
pebble-game-with-colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the
graph of a minimally pinned axis-parallel bar-slider framework.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12.
10. Conclusions and open problems
We presented a new characterization of (k, `)-sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and
used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge-
disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity-certifying decompositions in the upper range
and runs in time O(n2), which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the
upper range from [12].
We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity-certifying decomposi-
tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 17
We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to
either a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-
Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer-
tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between
the `+1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of `, to matroid union augmenting
paths, which do not apply in the upper range.
Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In [6], Gabow and Westermann give an O(n3/2)
algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from
dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths,
which extend a maps-and-trees decomposition. The O(n3/2) algorithm uses two subroutines to
find augmenting paths: cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch
scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths.
We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester-
mann’s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen-
tation of the pebble game, detailed in [12, 13] are simpler and easier to implement than those
used to support cyclic scanning.
The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then:
Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain
an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm for the lower range.
Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the `+1 pebble condition and derive an O(n3/2) pebble
game algorithm for the upper range.
In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm
for decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees.

The focus of this paper is decompositions of (k, `)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs
that certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a
graph is (k, `)-sparse if no subset of n′ vertices spans more than kn′− ` edges in the graph; a
(k, `)-sparse graph with kn′− ` edges is (k, `)-tight. We call the range k ≤ `≤ 2k−1 the upper
range of sparse graphs and 0≤ `≤ k the lower range.
In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity
in the upper range of `. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad-
dressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs
and graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.
Our algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the
pebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that
produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.
We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to
previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide
a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-
Tutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the
properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].
Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the
matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in

the upper range. Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening
of augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs.
1.1. Sparse graphs
A graph is (k, `)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m′ edges and n′ vertices, m′ ≤
kn′− `. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤ ` ≤ 2k− 1, and from now on in this
paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn−` edges
is called tight.
For a graph G = (V,E), and V ′ ⊂ V , we use the notation span(V ′) for the number of edges
in the subgraph induced by V ′. In a directed graph, out(V ′) is the number of edges with the tail
in V ′ and the head in V −V ′; for a subgraph induced by V ′, we call such an edge an out-edge.
There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of
a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.
Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.
1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions
A k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Figure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described
by the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k,k)-tight
graphs.
A map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is
exactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint map-
graphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible
configuration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently
defined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1
A (k, `)-maps-and-trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k− ` edge-disjoint
map-graphs and ` spanning trees.
Another characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as
the (1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. The k-map-graphs are evidently (k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that
the converse holds as well.
1 Our terminology follows Lovász in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases
of the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3
Fig. 1. Examples of sparsity-certifying decompositions: (a) a 3-arborescence; (b) a 2-map-graph; (c) a
(2,1)-maps-and-trees. Edges with the same line style belong to the same subgraph. The 2-map-graph is
shown with a certifying orientation.
A `Tk is a decomposition into ` edge-disjoint (not necessarily spanning) trees such that each
vertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2(a) shows an example of a 3T2.
Given a subgraph G′ of a `Tk graph G, the set of tree-pieces in G′ is the collection of the
components of the trees in G induced by G′ (since G′ is a subgraph each tree may contribute
multiple pieces to the set of tree-pieces in G′). We observe that these tree-pieces may come
from the same tree or be single-vertex “empty trees.” It is also helpful to note that the definition
of a tree-piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An `Tk decomposition is proper if the set of
tree-pieces in any subgraph G′ has size at least `.
Figure 2(a) shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition; we note that one of the trees is an
isolated vertex in the bottom-right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2(b) has three black tree-
pieces and one gray tree-piece: an isolated vertex at the top-right corner, and two single edges.
These count as three tree-pieces, even though they come from the same back tree when the
whole graph in considered. Figure 2(c) shows another subgraph; in this case there are three
gray tree-pieces and one black one.
Table 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper.
The decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak-
ing a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar-
sity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper `Tk decompositions;
and the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.
2. Historical background
The well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k,k)-tight graphs to
the existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,
4 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran

corner. (b) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree-pieces and one gray
tree-piece. (c) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree-pieces (one is a
single vertex) and one black tree-piece.
Edmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps-
and-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and
matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].
In rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman [11] shows that (2,3)-tight (Laman)
graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. Tay
[21] proved an analogous result for body-bar frameworks in any dimension using (k,k)-tight
graphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo [2] proved the
equivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay [22] used this condition to give a
direct proof of Laman’s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all `Tk for k≤ `≤ 2k−1.
Haas [7] studied `Tk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and
proper `Tk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble-
game-with-colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of
sparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation [11, 21, 22, 24].
A pebble game algorithm was first proposed in [10] as an elegant alternative to Hendrick-
son’s Laman graph algorithms [9]. Berg and Jordan [1], provided the formal analysis of the
pebble game of [10] and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and
Streinu [12] generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0≤ `≤ 2k−1, and
left as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions.
3. The pebble game with colors
Our pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative
integers k and `. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm
for the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase “with colors” is necessary
only for comparison to [12], we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 5
We now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a
fixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves; a move consists in the
addition and/or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured
by a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored
by the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the
notation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w.
We describe the pebble game with colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed
moves.
Fig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves: (a) add-edge. (b) pebble-slide. Pebbles on vertices
are shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them.
Initialization: In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start
by placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for i = 1,2, . . . ,k.
Add-edge-with-colors: Let v and w be vertices with at least `+1 pebbles on them. Assume
(w.l.o.g.) that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw
to E(H) and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge.
Figure 3(a) shows examples of the add-edge move.
Pebble-slide: Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace
vw with wv in E(H); put the pebble that was on vw on v; and put p on wv.
Note that the color of an edge can change with a pebble-slide move. Figure 3(b) shows
examples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices
are represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them.
From the definition of the pebble-slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is
always either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However,
when making a sequence of pebble-slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is
sometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end
of the path to the beginning.
The output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration.
Output: At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location
and colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble
game configuration colors the edges.
We say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the (k, `)-pebble game
or that H is a pebble-game graph.
Since each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game’s configuration partitions
the edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble-
game-with-colors decomposition. Figure 4(a) shows an example of a (2,2)-tight graph with a
pebble-game decomposition.
Let G = (V,E) be pebble-game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges,
and let G′ be a subgraph of G. Then the coloring of G induces a set of monochromatic con-

nected subgraphs of G′ (there may be more than one of the same color). Such a monochromatic
subgraph is called a map-graph-piece of G′ if it contains a cycle (in G′) and a tree-piece of G′
otherwise. The set of tree-pieces of G′ is the collection of tree-pieces induced by G′. As with
the corresponding definition for `Tk s, the set of tree-pieces is defined relative to a specific sub-
graph; in particular a tree-piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned
by G′.
The properties of pebble-game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2
shows that each color must be (1,0)-sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4(a) shows
this.
For example Figure 4(a) shows a (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decom-
position. The whole graph contains a gray tree-piece and a black tree-piece that is an isolated
vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4(b) has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black
tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4(c), however, the black cycle does not
contribute a tree-piece. All three tree-pieces in this subgraph are single-vertex gray trees.
In the following discussion, we use the notation peb(v) for the number of pebbles on v and
pebi(v) to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v.
Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper.
4. Our Results
We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 7
Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of [12] to include colors. It says
that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games
discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly.
Theorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse
with 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.
Next we consider pebble-game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of
proper `Tk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.
Theorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game
graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each
is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse
graphs in the decomposition.
The (1,0)-sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles; thus
Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble-game-with-colors decompositions obtained
by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the
requirement that the set of tree-pieces have size at least ` in Theorem 2 and the definition of a
proper `Tk .
Our next results show that for any pebble-game graph, we can specialize its pebble game
construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk . We call these
specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc-
tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results.
We observe Theorem 2 that maps-and-trees are special cases of the pebble-game decompo-
sition: both spanning trees and spanning map-graphs are (1,0)-sparse, and each of the spanning
trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph.
The case of proper `Tk graphs is more subtle; if each color in a pebble-game decomposition
is a forest, then we have found a proper `Tk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper
`Tk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper `Tk decompositions is
sufficient to certify sparsity.
We now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range.
Theorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-
maps-and-trees.
Theorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper `Tk graphs coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it is a proper
`Tk with kn− ` edges.
As corollaries, we obtain the existing decomposition results for sparse graphs.
Corollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph
G is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.
Corollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a
proper `Tk .
Efficiently finding canonical pebble game constructions. The proofs of Theorem 3 and Theo-
rem 4 lead to an obvious algorithm with O(n3) running time for the decomposition problem.
Our last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus
8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in
O(n2) time and space.
These time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of [12]
without any change in complexity.
5. Pebble game graphs
In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from [12] to the pebble game
with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over
directly from the pebble games of [12], we refer the reader there for the proofs.
We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game.
Lemma 7 (Pebble game invariants). During the execution of the pebble game, the following
invariants are maintained in H:
(I1) There are at least ` pebbles on V . [12]
(I2) For each vertex v, span(v)+out(v)+peb(v) = k. [12]
(I3) For each V ′ ⊂V , span(V ′)+out(V ′)+peb(V ′) = kn′. [12]
(I4) For every vertex v ∈V , outi(v)+pebi(v) = 1.
(I5) Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with
a pebble of color ci or a cycle.
Proof. (I1), (I2), and (I3) come directly from [12].
(I4) This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors.
That add-edge and pebble-slide moves preserve (I4) is clear from inspection.
(I5) By (I4), a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of
the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually
visit some vertex twice.
From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse.
Lemma 8 (Pebble-game graphs are sparse [12]). Let H be a graph constructed with the
pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly ` pebbles on V (H), then H is tight.
The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble-game graph is the following.
Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble-slide moves to reduce
the out degree of v by one.
Lemma 9 (The `+1 pebble condition [12]). Let vw be an edge such that H + vw is sparse. If
peb({v,w}) &lt; `+1, then a pebble not on {v,w} can be brought to either v or w.
It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.
Theorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse
with 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.
6. The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition
In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We
start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components
in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 9
Lemma 10 (Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse). Let Hi be the sub-
graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is (1,0)-sparse, for
i = 1, . . . ,k.
Proof. By (I4) Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex.
Lemma 11 (Tree-pieces in a pebble-game graph). Every subgraph of the directed graph H
in a pebble game construction contains at least ` monochromatic tree-pieces, and each of these
is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge.
Recall that an out-edge from a subgraph H ′ = (V ′,E ′) is an edge vw with v∈V ′ and vw /∈ E ′.
Proof. Let H ′ = (V ′,E ′) be a non-empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality
that H ′ is induced by V ′. By (I3), out(V ′)+ peb(V ′) ≥ `. We will show that each pebble and
out-edge tail is the root of a tree-piece.
Consider a vertex v ∈ V ′ and a color ci. By (I4) there is a unique monochromatic directed
path of color ci starting at v. By (I5), if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle.
Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge also in color ci (i.e., if the
monochromatic path from v leaves V ′), then the path cannot have a cycle in H ′.
Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning
of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out-edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each
pebble and out-edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired.
Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following.
Lemma 12 (Pebbles are the roots of trees). In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of
color ci is the root of a (possibly empty) monochromatic tree-piece of color ci.
Remark: Haas showed in [7] that in a `Tk , a subgraph induced by n′ ≥ 2 vertices with m′
edges has exactly kn′−m′ tree-pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas’ result by extending it
to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree-pieces, showing the connection
between the `+1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper `Tk .
We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of
the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors.
Theorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game
graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each
is (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse
graphs in the decomposition.
Proof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,0)-sparse sub-
graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.
For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can
span at most n− ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game
decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.
Remark: We observe that a pebble-game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out
of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson’s Laman graph extraction algorithm [9]. Indeed,
pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in
10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Maps-and-trees are a special case of pebble-game decompositions for tight graphs: if there
are no cycles in ` of the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding ` pebbles must be
spanning, since they have n− 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range
pebble-game decomposition, then the tree-pieces condition ensures that the pebble-game de-
composition is a proper `Tk .
In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps-
and-trees and proper `Tk decompositions.
7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions
In this section we prove the main theorems (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4), continuing the inves-
tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a
minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15
and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that
this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map-graphs are created only when we
add more than k(n′−1) edges to some set of n′ vertices. For the lower range, this implies that
every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above
follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a
unified framework.
In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi-
fication of the add-edge move.
Canonical add-edge: When performing an add-edge move, cover the new edge with a color
that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present.
The second is a restriction on which pebble-slide moves we allow.
Canonical pebble-slide: A pebble-slide move is allowed only when it does not create a
monochromatic cycle.
We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section
we will show that every pebble-game graph has a canonical pebble game construction (Lemma
14 and Lemma 15) and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper `Tk and
maps-and-trees decompositions (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4).
We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game
constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways
for cycles to form in the lowest ` colors.
Lemma 13 (Monochromatic cycle creation). Let v ∈ V have a pebble p of color ci on it and
let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created
in exactly one of the following ways:
(M1) The edge vw is added with an add-edge move.
(M2) The edge wv is reversed by a pebble-slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse
edge vw.
Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7.
By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a
connected monochromatic subgraph. (M1) and (M2) are the only ways to do this in a pebble
game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or
a new pebble is put on it by a pebble-slide move.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 11

adding a black edge. (b) A type (M2) move creates a cycle with a pebble-slide move. The vertices are
labeled according to their role in the definition of the moves.
Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show examples of (M1) and (M2) map-graph creation moves,
respectively, in a (2,0)-pebble game construction.
We next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb-
ble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases (M1) and (M2) sepa-
rately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add-edge and canonical
pebble-slide moves.
Lemma 14 (The canonical add-edge move). Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc-
tion. Cycle creation steps of type (M1) can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ `′, where
`′ = min{k, `}.
Proof. For add-edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If
this is not possible, then there are `+1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color
to cover the new edge.
Remark: We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical
add-edge moves create cycles in the upper range.
The canonical pebble-slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain
the same class of graphs using only canonical pebble-slide moves, we need to extend Lemma
9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that
reorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same
thing.
Lemma 15 (The canonical pebble-slide move). Any sequence of pebble-slide moves leading
to an add-edge move can be replaced with one that has no (M2) steps and allows the same
add-edge move.
In other words, if it is possible to collect `+ 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added,
then it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles.
12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this
the shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used
in previous work on the lower range.
Figure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an (M2) step
at the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble-slides. Since one
application of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w′ to w, and a
path from v to w′ is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the
sequence of moves we want.
Fig. 6. Outline of the shortcut construction: (a) An arbitrary simple path from v to w with curved lines
indicating simple paths. (b) An (M2) step. The black edge, about to be flipped, would create a cycle,
shown in dashed and solid gray, of the (unique) gray tree rooted at w. The solid gray edges were part
of the original path from (a). (c) The shortened path to the gray pebble; the new path follows the gray
tree all the way from the first time the original path touched the gray tree at w′. The path from v to w′ is
simple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple
path in H, and that the first move (the end of the path) is (M2). The (M2) step moves a pebble
of color ci from a vertex w onto the edge vw, which is reversed. Because the move is (M2), v
and w are contained in a maximal monochromatic tree of color ci. Call this tree H ′i , and observe
that it is rooted at w.
Now consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make
any of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on
this path in H ′i . We modify our sequence of moves as follows: delete, from the beginning, every
move before the one that reverses some edge yz; prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves
that moves the pebble on w to z in H ′i .

The path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines.
Fig. 8. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is
(M2); (b) avoiding the (M2) and simplifying the path.
Since no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated
the (M2) move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the
remaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new
sequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis.
The rest of the lemma follows by induction.
Together Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following.
Lemma 16. If G is a pebble-game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction.
Using canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble-game graphs
with maps-and-trees and `Tk graphs.
14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Theorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game
graphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-
maps-and-trees.
Proof. As observed above, a maps-and-trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game
decomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps-and-trees must be a pebble-game
graph.
For the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph.
From Lemma 8, we see that there are ` pebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The
definition of the canonical add-edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of
each ci for i = 1,2, . . . , `. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma
12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree-piece with n− 1 edges, yielding
the required ` edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Corollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph
G is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.
We next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when
`≥ k +1.
Theorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper Trees-and-trees coincide with peb-
ble-game graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it
is a proper `Tk with kn− ` edges.
Proof. As observed above, a proper `Tk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show
is that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper `Tk .
By Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree-pieces and the decom-
position into ` edge-disjoint trees. Finally, an application of (I4), shows that every vertex must
in in exactly k of the trees, as required.
Corollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a
proper `Tk .
8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions
A naı̈ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re-
quiring Θ(n2) time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction: in the worst case Θ(n)
applications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring Θ(n) time each, giving a total running
time of Θ(n3) for the decomposition problem.
In this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time
O(n2). We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.
Algorithm 17 (The canonical pebble game with colors).
Input: A graph G.
Output: A pebble-game graph H.
Method:
– Set V (H) = V (G) and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H.
– For each edge vw ∈ E(G) try to collect at least `+1 pebbles on v and w using pebble-slide
moves as described by Lemma 15.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 15
– If at least `+1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add-edge move as in Lemma
14, otherwise discard vw.
– Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles.
Correctness. Theorem 1 and the result from [24] that the sparse graphs are the independent
sets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction
found is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps-
and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition.
Complexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to
process O(n) edges added to H and O(m) edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an
edge of G that is added to H.
Each of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to
describe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a
subroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this.
Algorithm 18 (Finding a canonical path to a pebble.).
Input: Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H.
Output: If a pebble was found, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ otherwise. The configuration of H is updated.
Method:
– Start by doing a depth-first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and
return ‘no.’
– Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path v = v1,e1, . . . ,ep−1,vp = u, where the vi
are vertices and ei is the edge vivi+1. Let c[ei] be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use
the array c[] to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them
and the array s[] to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each
edge.
– Set s[u] = ‘end′ and set c[u] to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in
reverse order: vp,ep−1,ep−2, . . . ,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c[vi] is set; if so, go on to
the next i. Otherwise, check to see if c[vi+1] = c[ei].
– If it is, set s[vi] = ei and set c[vi] = c[ei], and go on to the next edge.
– Otherwise c[vi+1] 6= c[ei], try to find a monochromatic path in color c[vi+1] from vi to vi+1. If
a vertex x is encountered for which c[x] is set, we have a path vi = x1, f1,x2, . . . , fq−1,xq = x
that is monochromatic in the color of the edges; set c[xi] = c[ fi] and s[xi] = fi for i =
1,2, . . . ,q−1. If c[x] = c[ fq−1], stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro-
matic c[x] path from xq−1 to x using this same procedure.
– Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the
successor array s[v], s[s[v]], . . .
The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut
construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back
and forth, Algorithm 18 pre-computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three
times: once in the initial depth-first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a
canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O(n) time, for a total of O(n2) time
spent processing edges in H.
Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to
maintain components as in [12]. After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated
in time O(n). Finally, the results of [12, 13] show that the rejected edges take an amortized O(1)
time each.
16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran
Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom-
position problem in time O(n2).
9. An important special case: Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider-pinning
In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance,
k = 2, ` = 3. As discussed in the introduction, Laman’s theorem [11] characterizes minimally
rigid graphs as the (2,3)-tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the
current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider-pinning model of rigidity [15, 20]. Com-
binatorially, we model the bar-slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops
placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each
color.
We characterize the minimally rigid bar-slider graphs [20] as graphs that are:
1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.
2. (2,0)-tight when loops are included.
We call these graphs (2,0,3)-graded-tight, and they are a special case of the graded-sparse
graphs studied in our paper [14].
The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following.
Corollary 19 (Pebble games and slider-pinning). In any (2,3)-pebble game graph, if we
replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a (2,0,3)-graded-tight graph.
Proof. Follows from invariant (I3) of Lemma 7.
In [15], we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or
horizontal. We model the sliders as pre-colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction.
For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by:
1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.
2. Admit a 2-coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest (i.e., has no cycles), and each
monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color.
This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games.
Corollary 20 (The pebble game with colors and slider-pinning). In any canonical (2,3)-
pebble-game-with-colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the
graph of a minimally pinned axis-parallel bar-slider framework.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12.
10. Conclusions and open problems
We presented a new characterization of (k, `)-sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and
used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge-
disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity-certifying decompositions in the upper range
and runs in time O(n2), which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the
upper range from [12].
We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity-certifying decomposi-
tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.
Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 17
We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to
either a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-
Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer-
tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between
the `+1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of `, to matroid union augmenting
paths, which do not apply in the upper range.
Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In [6], Gabow and Westermann give an O(n3/2)
algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from
dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths,
which extend a maps-and-trees decomposition. The O(n3/2) algorithm uses two subroutines to
find augmenting paths: cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch
scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths.
We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester-
mann’s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen-
tation of the pebble game, detailed in [12, 13] are simpler and easier to implement than those
used to support cyclic scanning.
The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then:
Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain
an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm for the lower range.
Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the `+1 pebble condition and derive an O(n3/2) pebble
game algorithm for the upper range.
In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm
for decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees.

The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on  
the dark matter field fluid model

 Abstract 
The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid 
model with a non-Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle 
and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon 
system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the 
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. 
The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, 
which is far beyond the Roche’s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not 
be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark 
matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 × 10-22 s-1m-1. 
This model predicts that the Mars’s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration 
rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. 
Key Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars 
1. Introduction 
The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth-Moon system is that 
the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the 
Earth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the 
formation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well 
known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth’s rotation and Moon’s 
rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes 
based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The 
situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth-Moon 
system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this 
means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past.  Creationists 
argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the 
recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon 
would quickly fall inside the Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon 
would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence 
indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., 
the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal 
friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of 
present-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called “geological time scale 
difficulty” or “Lunar crisis” and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the 
tidal friction theory (Brush 1983).  
But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible 
scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 
its inception, the geological and physical conditions (such as the continent positions and 
drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial/snowball effect, etc) at 
remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction 
could be much less; therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various 
tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-
Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable 
distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray 
et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present 
rate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance 
in the response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those 
tidal friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about 
geological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and 
many parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time 
dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully 
adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those 
assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction.  
The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the 
evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In 
the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, 
University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model 
(Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with 
this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth 
system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 
about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of 
the Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the 
author’s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model.  
2.  Invisible matter 
In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is 
about 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently 
invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti-
gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster.   
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of 
such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current 
Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian 
physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.  
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in 
everywhere of the universe (the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to 
place); in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible 
matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible 
matter if there are  interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter.  
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 
detection limit of the current technology; otherwise, it would be detected long time ago 
with such dominant amount. 
With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the 
dark matter field fluid model with non-Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible 
matter (dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms) is called dark matter here. 
3. The dark matter field fluid model 
In this proposed model, it is assumed that: 
1.  A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly 
filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the 
celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property; it can 
interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties; therefore, it can have 
energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 
2.  The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter 
field fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary 
“baryonic” matter;  i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter 
field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the 
manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter 
field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with 
the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the 
celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the 
gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive 
force is unknown. 
With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may 
influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The 
common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes's law, a rigid non-
permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds 
number experiences a resistance force F 
rvF πμ6−=       (1) 
where v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity 
constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the 
velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual 
properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F 
may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the 
mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of 
both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is 
assumed to be of the scaled form 
        (2) mvrF n−−= 16πη
where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be 
viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and η 
is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to μ. The direction of the 
resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force 
described by Eq. 2 is velocity-dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to 
Newton's second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is 
   mvr
m n−−= 16πη      (3) 
Then  
       (4) )6exp( 10 vtrvv
n−−= πη
where v0 is the initial velocity (t = 0) of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a 
massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the 
gravitational center: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and 
(3) the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid.  The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the 
orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. 
However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is 
stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from 
the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is 
sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and 
centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively 
slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be 
approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is 
GMm 2
2 =       (5) 
where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is 
the radius of the orbit.  Inserting v of Eq.  4 into Eq. 5 yields  
   )12exp( 1
R n−= πη     (6) 
       (7) )12exp( 10 trRR
n−= πη
where 
R =       (8) 
R0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center.  Note that R exponentially increases 
with time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive 
force of dark matter field fluid.  The recessional rate of the sphere is 
dR n−= 112πη      (9) 
The acceleration of the recession is 
   ( Rr
Rd n 21
12 −= πη ) .     (10) 
The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the 
gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. 
According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating 
about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere 
ωπμ 38 rT −=       (11) 
where ω is the angular velocity of the sphere.  The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is 
opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent 
dark matter field fluid with angular velocity ω, similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted 
on the sphere is 
( ) ωπη mrT n 318 −−=      (12) 
The direction of the torque in Eq. 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The 
torque causes the negative angular acceleration 
=       (13) 
where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 
   ( )21
2 nrmI −=       (14) 
Therefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is 
   ωπη
d −−= 120      (15) 
Solving this equation yields 
       (16) )20exp( 10 tr
n−−= πηωω
where ω0 is the initial angular velocity.  One can see that the angular velocity of the 
sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to 
its angular velocity.   
For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 
     (17) 
The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and 
undetermined parameters; therefore, it is a critical test for this model. 
For two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 
15 yields 
   67.1

   (18) 
This is another critical test for this model. 
4. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model 
 The Moon-Earth system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is 
complex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also 
interactions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as 
an isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets 
on the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is 
assumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other. 
In addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is small enough to be ignored. The data 
about the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994,  and Lang, 1992) are 
listed below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may 
vary slightly with different data sources. 
Moon: 
    Mean radius:    r  = 1738.0 km 
    Mass:       m = 7.3483 × 1025 gram 
    Rotation period = 27.321661 days 
    Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 × 10-6 rad s-1 
    Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km 
    Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1 
    Orbit eccentricity    e = 0.0549 
    Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 ±  0.5 arcsec century-2 
       = (-1.255 ± 0.024) × 10-4 rad century-2
       = (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2
    Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 ±  0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 ±  0.02) × 10-9 m s-1 
Earth: 
    Mean radius:    r  = 6371.0 km 
    Mass:       m = 5.9742 × 1027 gram 
    Rotation period = 23 h 56m 04.098904s = 86164.098904s 
    Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 × 10-5 rad s-1 
    Mean distance to the Sun Rm= 149,597,870.61 km 
    Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1 
    Angular acceleration of Earth = (-5.5 ± 0.5) × 10-22 rad s-2
The Moon's angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth 
(receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey 
et .al., 1994). By inserting the data of the Moon's rotation and recession into Eq.  17, the 
result is 
 039.054.1
10662.21021.1
1092509.31026.1
   (19) 
The distance R in Eq. 19 is from the Moon's center to the Earth's center and the number 
384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the Moon's surface to the Earth's surface. 
Eq. 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of -1.67. The result is in accord 
with the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of -1.54 and -
1.67 may come from several sources: 
1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle 
2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere. 
3. The effect from Sun and other planets. 
4. Errors in data. 
5. Possible other unknown reasons. 
The two parameters n and η in Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 can be determined with two data 
sets.  The third data set can be used to further test the model.  If this model correctly 
describes the situation at hand, it should give consistent results for different motions. The 
values of n and η calculated from three different data sets are listed below (Note, the 
mean distance of the Moon to the Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the Earth are 
used in the calculation). 
    The value of n:          n = 0.64 
    From the Moon's rotation:   η  = 4.27 ×  10-22  s-1 m-1
    From the Earth's rotation:     η  = 4.26 × 10-22  s-1 m-1
    From the Moon's recession:  η = 4.64 × 10-22  s-1 m-1
One can see that the three values of η are consistent within the range of error in the data. 
    The average value of  η:   η = (4.39 ± 0.22) × 10-22 s-1 m-1
By inserting the data of the Earth's rotation, the Moon’s recession and the value of n into 
Eq. 18, the result is 
14.053.1
6371000
1738000
1021.11029.7
1092509.3105.5
)64.01(
  (20) 
This is also in accord with the model used here. 
The dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field 
fluid is -1.11 × 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between 
the Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 × 1020 N;  and the torque exerted by the dark matter field 
fluid on the Earth’s and the Moon's rotations is T = -5.49 × 1016 Nm and -1.15 × 1012 Nm, 
respectively.  
5. The evolution of Earth-Moon system 
Sonett  et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was 
about 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al., 
1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day 
was about 19.2 hours, this agrees very well with Sonett et al.'s result.   
Another critical aspect of modeling the evolution of the Earth-Moon system is to  
give a reasonable estimate of the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth when the 
system was established at 4.5 billion years ago. Based on the dark matter field fluid 
model, and the above result, the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth was about 
259000 km (center to center) or 250900 km (surface to surface) at 4.5 billion years ago, 
this is far beyond the Roche's limit. In the modern astronomy textbook by Chaisson and 
McMillan (Chaisson and McMillan, 1993, p.173), the estimated distance at 4.5 billion 
years ago was 250000 km, this is probably the most reasonable number that most 
astronomers believe and it agrees excellently with the result of this model. The closest 
distance of the Moon to the Earth by Hansen’s models was about 38 Earth radii or 
242000 km (Hansen, 1982).  
According to this model, the length of day of the Earth was about 8 hours at 4.5 
billion years ago. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the 
length of day of the Earth with the age of the Earth-Moon system described by this model 
along with data from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One 
can see that those data fit this model very well in their time range.  
Fig. 2 shows the geological data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from 
Sonett et al. (1996) and the description (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model 
for past 900 million years. One can see that the model agrees with the geological and 
fossil data beautifully.  
The important difference of this model with early models in describing the early 
evolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this model is based only on current data of the 
Moon-Earth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth 
rotation and continental drifting. Based on this model, the Earth-Moon system has been 
smoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate 
of the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description does not take it into 
account that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly 
significant changes in the motions of the Earth and the Moon, such as strong impacts by 
giant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very common in the universe. 
The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model 
agrees with geological evidence. Based on Eq. 9, the recessional rate exponentially 
increases with time. One may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become 
very large.  The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be 
3.04 × 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 × 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years. 
However, whether the Moon's recession will continue or at some time later another 
mechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction 
does affect the evolution of the Earth itself such as the surface crust structure, continental 
drifting and evolution of bio-system, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earth’s 
rotation, however, such role is not a dominant mechanism.  
Unfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital 
motion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results, 
the recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 × 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km 
century-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is 
-1.8 × 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of the Sun and the stable environment on 
the Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length 
of the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as 
some other evidences) suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the 
year over the billion years and the Earth's orbital motion is more stable than its rotation.  
This suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same 
direction and similar speed of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital range). Therefore, the 
Earth's orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter 
field fluid. However, this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify 
if this is the case.  
6. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars 
The Moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface, even there is no air, therefore, 
there is no ocean-like tidal friction force to slow its rotation; however, the rotation of the 
Moon is still slowing at significant rate of (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2,  which agrees 
with the model very well. Based on this, one may reasonably think that the Mars’s 
rotation should be slowing also. 
The Mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted human’s great attention 
since ancient time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades. 
NASA, Russian and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect 
data and study this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about the 
history of this planet to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth, the Mars rotates about 
its central axis and revolves around the Sun, however, the Mars does not have a massive 
moon circulating it (Mars has two small satellites: Phobos and Deimos) and there is no 
liquid fluid on its surface, therefore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal friction force to 
slow its rotation by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and current the 
Mars's data, this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the Mars should be about 
-4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the 
solar days/Mars year, the vertical dash line marks the current age of the Mars with 
assumption that the Mars was formed in a similar time period of the Earth formation. 
Such description was not given before according to the author’s knowledge and is 
completely skeptical due to lack of reliable data.  However, with further expansion of the 
research and exploration on the Mars, we shall feel confident that the reliable data about 
the angular rotation acceleration of the Mars will be available in the near future which 
will provide a vital test for the prediction of this model. There are also other factors 
which may affect the Mars’s rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season 
change, winds, possible volcano eruptions and Mars quakes. Therefore, the data has to be 
carefully analyzed. 
7.  Discussion about the model 
From the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the 
geological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the 
Earth-Moon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional 
parameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and 
receding (Eq.  17 and Eq.  18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in 
the same gravitational system, such relationship is not known before. Such success can 
not be explained by “coincidence” or “luck” because of so many data involved (current 
Earth’s and Moon’s data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is just a 
“ad hoc” or a wrong model, although the chance for the natural happening of such 
“coincidence” or “luck” could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery; the future Mars’s 
data will clarify this; otherwise, a new theory from different approach can be developed 
to give the same or better description as this model does. It is certain that this model is 
not perfect and may have defects, further development may be conducted. 
James Clark Maxwell said in the 1873 “ The vast interplanetary and interstellar 
regions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has 
not seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find 
them to be already full of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human power can 
remove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite 
continuity. It extends unbroken from star to star ….” The medium that Maxwell talked 
about is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The 
Michelson-Morley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not 
depend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar 
space. In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically 
recently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The dark matter field 
fluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and “precisely” described by Maxwell. 
7. Conclusion 
The evolution of the Earth-Moon system can be described by the dark matter field 
fluid model with non-Newtonian approach and the current data of the Earth and the Moon 
fits this model very well. At 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the 
Earth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Roche’s limit and the length of 
day was about 8 hours. The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system 
described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may 
not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The Mars’s rotation 
is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2.

The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth-Moon system is that 
the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the 
Earth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the 
formation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well 
known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth’s rotation and Moon’s 
rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes 
based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The 
situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth-Moon 
system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this 
means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past.  Creationists 
argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the 
recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon 
would quickly fall inside the Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon 
would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence 
indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., 
the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal 
friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of 
present-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called “geological time scale 
difficulty” or “Lunar crisis” and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the 
tidal friction theory (Brush 1983).  
But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible 
scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 
its inception, the geological and physical conditions (such as the continent positions and 
drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial/snowball effect, etc) at 
remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction 
could be much less; therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various 
tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-
Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable 
distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray 
et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present 
rate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance 
in the response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those 
tidal friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about 
geological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and 
many parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time 
dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully 
adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those 
assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction.  
The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the 
evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In 
the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, 
University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model 
(Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with 
this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth 
system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 
about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of 
the Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the 
author’s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model.  
2.  Invisible matter 
In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is 
about 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently 
invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti-
gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster.   
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of 
such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current 
Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian 
physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.  
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in 
everywhere of the universe (the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to 
place); in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible 
matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible 
matter if there are  interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter.  
If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, 
then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 
detection limit of the current technology; otherwise, it would be detected long time ago 
with such dominant amount. 
With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the 
dark matter field fluid model with non-Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible 
matter (dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms) is called dark matter here. 
3. The dark matter field fluid model 
In this proposed model, it is assumed that: 
1.  A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly 
filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the 
celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property; it can 
interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties; therefore, it can have 
energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 
2.  The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter 
field fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary 
“baryonic” matter;  i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter 
field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the 
manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter 
field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with 
the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the 
celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the 
gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive 
force is unknown. 
With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may 
influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The 
common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes's law, a rigid non-
permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds 
number experiences a resistance force F 
rvF πμ6−=       (1) 
where v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity 
constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the 
velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual 
properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F 
may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the 
mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of 
both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is 
assumed to be of the scaled form 
        (2) mvrF n−−= 16πη
where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be 
viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and η 
is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to μ. The direction of the 
resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force 
described by Eq. 2 is velocity-dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to 
Newton's second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is 
   mvr
m n−−= 16πη      (3) 
Then  
       (4) )6exp( 10 vtrvv
n−−= πη
where v0 is the initial velocity (t = 0) of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a 
massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the 
gravitational center: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and 
(3) the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid.  The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the 
orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. 
However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is 
stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from 
the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is 
sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and 
centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively 
slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be 
approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is 
GMm 2
2 =       (5) 
where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is 
the radius of the orbit.  Inserting v of Eq.  4 into Eq. 5 yields  
   )12exp( 1
R n−= πη     (6) 
       (7) )12exp( 10 trRR
n−= πη
where 
R =       (8) 
R0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center.  Note that R exponentially increases 
with time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive 
force of dark matter field fluid.  The recessional rate of the sphere is 
dR n−= 112πη      (9) 
The acceleration of the recession is 
   ( Rr
Rd n 21
12 −= πη ) .     (10) 
The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the 
gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. 
According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating 
about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere 
ωπμ 38 rT −=       (11) 
where ω is the angular velocity of the sphere.  The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is 
opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent 
dark matter field fluid with angular velocity ω, similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted 
on the sphere is 
( ) ωπη mrT n 318 −−=      (12) 
The direction of the torque in Eq. 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The 
torque causes the negative angular acceleration 
=       (13) 
where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 
   ( )21
2 nrmI −=       (14) 
Therefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is 
   ωπη
d −−= 120      (15) 
Solving this equation yields 
       (16) )20exp( 10 tr
n−−= πηωω
where ω0 is the initial angular velocity.  One can see that the angular velocity of the 
sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to 
its angular velocity.   
For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 
     (17) 
The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and 
undetermined parameters; therefore, it is a critical test for this model. 
For two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 
15 yields 
   67.1
1 −=−=⎟⎟
   (18) 
This is another critical test for this model. 
4. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model 
 The Moon-Earth system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is 
complex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also 
interactions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as 
an isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets 
on the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is 
assumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other. 
In addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is small enough to be ignored. The data 
about the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994,  and Lang, 1992) are 
listed below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may 
vary slightly with different data sources. 
Moon: 
    Mean radius:    r  = 1738.0 km 
    Mass:       m = 7.3483 × 1025 gram 
    Rotation period = 27.321661 days 
    Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 × 10-6 rad s-1 
    Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km 
    Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1 
    Orbit eccentricity    e = 0.0549 
    Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 ±  0.5 arcsec century-2 
       = (-1.255 ± 0.024) × 10-4 rad century-2
       = (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2
    Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 ±  0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 ±  0.02) × 10-9 m s-1 
Earth: 
    Mean radius:    r  = 6371.0 km 
    Mass:       m = 5.9742 × 1027 gram 
    Rotation period = 23 h 56m 04.098904s = 86164.098904s 
    Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 × 10-5 rad s-1 
    Mean distance to the Sun Rm= 149,597,870.61 km 
    Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1 
    Angular acceleration of Earth = (-5.5 ± 0.5) × 10-22 rad s-2
The Moon's angular rotation acceleration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth 
(receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey 
et .al., 1994). By inserting the data of the Moon's rotation and recession into Eq.  17, the 
result is 
 039.054.1
10662.21021.1
1092509.31026.1
   (19) 
The distance R in Eq. 19 is from the Moon's center to the Earth's center and the number 
384400 km is assumed to be the distance from the Moon's surface to the Earth's surface. 
Eq. 19 is in good agreement with the theoretical value of -1.67. The result is in accord 
with the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of -1.54 and -
1.67 may come from several sources: 
1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle 
2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere. 
3. The effect from Sun and other planets. 
4. Errors in data. 
5. Possible other unknown reasons. 
The two parameters n and η in Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 can be determined with two data 
sets.  The third data set can be used to further test the model.  If this model correctly 
describes the situation at hand, it should give consistent results for different motions. The 
values of n and η calculated from three different data sets are listed below (Note, the 
mean distance of the Moon to the Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the Earth are 
used in the calculation). 
    The value of n:          n = 0.64 
    From the Moon's rotation:   η  = 4.27 ×  10-22  s-1 m-1
    From the Earth's rotation:     η  = 4.26 × 10-22  s-1 m-1
    From the Moon's recession:  η = 4.64 × 10-22  s-1 m-1
One can see that the three values of η are consistent within the range of error in the data. 
    The average value of  η:   η = (4.39 ± 0.22) × 10-22 s-1 m-1
By inserting the data of the Earth's rotation, the Moon’s recession and the value of n into 
Eq. 18, the result is

This is also in accord with the model used here. 
The dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field 
fluid is -1.11 × 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between 
the Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 × 1020 N;  and the torque exerted by the dark matter field 
fluid on the Earth’s and the Moon's rotations is T = -5.49 × 1016 Nm and -1.15 × 1012 Nm, 
respectively.  
5. The evolution of Earth-Moon system 
Sonett  et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was 
about 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al., 
1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day 
was about 19.2 hours, this agrees very well with Sonett et al.'s result.   
Another critical aspect of modeling the evolution of the Earth-Moon system is to  
give a reasonable estimate of the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth when the 
system was established at 4.5 billion years ago. Based on the dark matter field fluid 
model, and the above result, the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth was about 
259000 km (center to center) or 250900 km (surface to surface) at 4.5 billion years ago, 
this is far beyond the Roche's limit. In the modern astronomy textbook by Chaisson and 
McMillan (Chaisson and McMillan, 1993, p.173), the estimated distance at 4.5 billion 
years ago was 250000 km, this is probably the most reasonable number that most 
astronomers believe and it agrees excellently with the result of this model. The closest 
distance of the Moon to the Earth by Hansen’s models was about 38 Earth radii or 
242000 km (Hansen, 1982).  
According to this model, the length of day of the Earth was about 8 hours at 4.5 
billion years ago. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the 
length of day of the Earth with the age of the Earth-Moon system described by this model 
along with data from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One 
can see that those data fit this model very well in their time range.  
Fig. 2 shows the geological data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from 
Sonett et al. (1996) and the description (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model 
for past 900 million years. One can see that the model agrees with the geological and 
fossil data beautifully.  
The important difference of this model with early models in describing the early 
evolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this model is based only on current data of the 
Moon-Earth system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth 
rotation and continental drifting. Based on this model, the Earth-Moon system has been 
smoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate 
of the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description does not take it into 
account that there might be special events happened in the past to cause the suddenly 
significant changes in the motions of the Earth and the Moon, such as strong impacts by 
giant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very common in the universe. 
The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model 
agrees with geological evidence. Based on Eq. 9, the recessional rate exponentially 
increases with time. One may then imagine that the recessional rate will quickly become 
very large.  The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be 
3.04 × 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 × 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years. 
However, whether the Moon's recession will continue or at some time later another 
mechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction 
does affect the evolution of the Earth itself such as the surface crust structure, continental 
drifting and evolution of bio-system, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earth’s 
rotation, however, such role is not a dominant mechanism.  
Unfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital 
motion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results, 
the recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 × 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km 
century-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is 
-1.8 × 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of the Sun and the stable environment on 
the Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length 
of the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as 
some other evidences) suggest that there has been no apparent change in the length of the 
year over the billion years and the Earth's orbital motion is more stable than its rotation.  
This suggests that dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same 
direction and similar speed of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital range). Therefore, the 
Earth's orbital motion experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter 
field fluid. However, this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify 
if this is the case.  
6. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars 
The Moon does not have liquid fluid on its surface, even there is no air, therefore, 
there is no ocean-like tidal friction force to slow its rotation; however, the rotation of the 
Moon is still slowing at significant rate of (-1.260 ± 0.024) × 10-23 rad s-2,  which agrees 
with the model very well. Based on this, one may reasonably think that the Mars’s 
rotation should be slowing also. 
The Mars is our nearest neighbor which has attracted human’s great attention 
since ancient time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades. 
NASA, Russian and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect 
data and study this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about the 
history of this planet to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth, the Mars rotates about 
its central axis and revolves around the Sun, however, the Mars does not have a massive 
moon circulating it (Mars has two small satellites: Phobos and Deimos) and there is no 
liquid fluid on its surface, therefore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal friction force to 
slow its rotation by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and current the 
Mars's data, this model predicts that the angular acceleration of the Mars should be about 
-4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of the length of day and the 
solar days/Mars year, the vertical dash line marks the current age of the Mars with 
assumption that the Mars was formed in a similar time period of the Earth formation. 
Such description was not given before according to the author’s knowledge and is 
completely skeptical due to lack of reliable data.  However, with further expansion of the 
research and exploration on the Mars, we shall feel confident that the reliable data about 
the angular rotation acceleration of the Mars will be available in the near future which 
will provide a vital test for the prediction of this model. There are also other factors 
which may affect the Mars’s rotation rate such as mass redistribution due to season 
change, winds, possible volcano eruptions and Mars quakes. Therefore, the data has to be 
carefully analyzed. 
7.  Discussion about the model 
From the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the 
geological and fossil data agree with the model very well and the past evolution of the 
Earth-Moon system can be described by the model without introducing any additional 
parameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and 
receding (Eq.  17 and Eq.  18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in 
the same gravitational system, such relationship is not known before. Such success can 
not be explained by “coincidence” or “luck” because of so many data involved (current 
Earth’s and Moon’s data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is just a 
“ad hoc” or a wrong model, although the chance for the natural happening of such 
“coincidence” or “luck” could be greater than wining a jackpot lottery; the future Mars’s 
data will clarify this; otherwise, a new theory from different approach can be developed 
to give the same or better description as this model does. It is certain that this model is 
not perfect and may have defects, further development may be conducted. 
James Clark Maxwell said in the 1873 “ The vast interplanetary and interstellar 
regions will no longer be regarded as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has 
not seen fit to fill with the symbols of the manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find 
them to be already full of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human power can 
remove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite 
continuity. It extends unbroken from star to star ….” The medium that Maxwell talked 
about is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The 
Michelson-Morley experiment only proved that the light wave propagation does not 
depend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar 
space. In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically 
recently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The dark matter field 
fluid is just a part of such wonderful medium and “precisely” described by Maxwell. 
7. Conclusion 
The evolution of the Earth-Moon system can be described by the dark matter field 
fluid model with non-Newtonian approach and the current data of the Earth and the Moon 
fits this model very well. At 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the 
Earth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Roche’s limit and the length of 
day was about 8 hours. The general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system 
described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may 
not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The Mars’s rotation 
is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10-22 rad s-2.
