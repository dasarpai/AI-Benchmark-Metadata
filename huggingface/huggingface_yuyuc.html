Dried by desiccation under high vacuum over phosphorous pentoxide at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 11.98 g pale- yellow solid [A].  LCMS(monitorbase) showed it to be DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 90%.  _ _ This material was crystallised from acetonitrile; dissolved up in ~1 litre boiling acetonitrile and the cloudy solution filtered hot through a fluted paper. Crystallisation of product from the filtrate was eventually achieved, with difficulty, by rapid cooling in drikold/acetone and seeding/scratching as it warmed up. Cooled in ice/water then the solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum at room temperature to constant weight.

The reaction mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc , and washed sequentially with water and saturated brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude oil was triturated with EtOAc, Et2O and hexane to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give P1 N-(4-(5-chlorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ylamino)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide (680mg, 38%)as a tan solid.

The tube was then charged with nitrogen and dioxane (0.589 mL) was added. The tube was then evacuated again and placed under a nitrogen balloon for 8 hours. LC/MS confirmed formation of the product (m+1 = 418) at t= 2.07 min. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo leaing a brown solid (472 mg). This material was the redissolved in EtOAc, filtered through Celite, washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. Concentration in vacuo gave a rust solid (272 mg). This material was purified by ISCO (0-10% MeOH/DCM). Concentration of the fractions in vacuo gave an orange oil. This material was then repurifed by ISCO (4-8% MeOH/DCM) and (0-4% MeOH/DCM). Both gradients resulted in impure material, so the recovered orange oil was purified again by ISCO (60-100% EtOAc/Hex). Concentration in vacuo gave a yellow solid (34.8 mg). LC/MS showed this material to still be only 80% pure, so it was purified again by ISCO (55-95% EtOAc/Hex). A yellow solid (25.4 mg) was again collected.

The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Phenomenex Gemini C18 110A (axia) column, 5Âµ silica, 21 mm diameter, 150 mm length), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.5% NH3 and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were evaporated to dryness to afford as a white solid. The product crashed out on the HPLC coloumn and blocked the system, which gave bad recovery.  Turns out the product is not stable. 2D TLC shows tailing of product..  </span></div></div>
