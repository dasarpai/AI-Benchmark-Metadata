not always exhibit the expected level of empathy or comprehension.&quot;:100,&quot;The response is somewhat creative and original, providing a mix of conventional and new ideas.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally recognizes and respects cultural nuances in language and behavior, but there are occasional lapses.&quot;:100,&quot;The model sometimes effectively manages ambiguous queries, asking relevant clarifying questions or making reasonable assumptions, but occasionally provides misguided responses.&quot;:100,&quot;The model commonly grasps cultural subtleties and sensitivities but occasionally struggles to adjust its responses appropriately.&quot;:100,&quot;The model detects false data in the majority of cases and tries to rectify it, but sometimes makes mistakes or leaves out crucial details.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally tailors its responses aptly, but there are occasional discrepancies in the complexity level.&quot;:100,&quot;The response occasionally uses the term in its mathematical context but lacks consistency.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally maintains a professional tone, but there are instances where it uses informal language.&quot;:100,&quot;The

cognizance or compassion, but might not totally engage the reader.&quot;:100,&quot;The model comprehends and answers to majority of the directives or requests, but overlooks a few steps or specifics.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally retains the context in its responses, but it sometimes loses track of more complex or nuanced topics.&quot;:99,&quot;The model somewhat adjusts its tone and style according to the user's emotions and circumstances, but it could better meet user needs.&quot;:100,&quot;The instructions are mostly correct but may lack clarity or omit some steps.&quot;:100,&quot;The response balances between giving answers and promoting critical thinking, but doesn't effectively encourage problem-solving.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally upholds the

data, but overlooks minor aspects.&quot;:100,&quot;The model employs humor sporadically and appropriately, adding a bit of lightness to the conversation.&quot;:100,&quot;The response asks some probing questions but may not fully explore the topic.&quot;:100,&quot;The model predominantly integrates cultural sensitivities into its responses, but occasionally lacks profundity in comprehension or fails to identify less apparent cultural subtleties.&quot;:100,&quot;The model fairly maintains a conversation by remembering some past responses, but sometimes fails to build upon them effectively.&quot;:100,&quot;The model intermittently uses humor effectively, but the humor frequently lacks pertinence or suitability.&quot;:100,&quot;The response contains an average use of language features, demonstrating a rudimentary understanding of complex language structures.&quot;:100,&quot;The model sporadically recognizes cultural subtleties, but its replies could still be enhanced for superior cultural flexibility.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's response moderately adjusts to the user's communication style, however, it occasionally reverts to its original language and tone.&quot;:100,&quot;The model shows a basic understanding of cultural nuances, but may occasionally miss subtleties.&quot;:100,&quot;The model handles the sensitive topic reasonably well, but there are minor instances of bias or insensitivity.&quot;:100,&quot;The reply deals with the question but may overlook some crucial aspects or facts.&quot;:100,&quot;The response shows some level of creativity, and is relatively engaging but may occasionally revert to repetitive or predictable responses.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally identifies and reacts to variations in tone and mood, though it may have difficulties with sudden changes in context.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often comprehends and responds suitably to specialized language, although there could be some mistakes or misinterpretations.&quot;:100,&quot;The model sporadically poses questions for clarification or makes sensible deductions, but it's unreliable in dealing with unclear inputs.&quot;:100,&quot;The model intermittently aligns with the tone, formality, and level of politeness in the user's input, but irregularities are evident.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often adjusts language complexity and vocabulary usage to fit the user's proficiency, but sometimes uses language that is too complex or too simple.&quot;:100,&quot;The model frequently identifies the user's emotional condition and tries to react empathetically, but on occasion, its reactions may not meet the user's emotional requirements.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally understands the ambiguity and attempts to clarify it, but the response is not always accurate or helpful.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's replies convey an elementary level of cultural sensitivity, but occasionally lack profundity of comprehension or resort to

engaging, keeping the user's interest to a certain degree.&quot;:100,&quot;The model adapts its communication style to some extent, but it may not always be appropriate or consistent.&quot;:100,&quot;The response exhibits a fair grasp of other languages and is capable of translating with a reasonable degree of accuracy, though occasionally it loses context or significance.&quot;:100,&quot;The response partially acknowledges and reacts to the user's emotional condition, but there's room for betterment.&quot;:100,&quot;The model moderately adapts to the user's style of speech and vocabulary, improving the flow of the conversation but still with noticeable mismatches.&quot;:100,&quot;The model understands the user's query and provides some relevant and accurate information, but there are significant gaps.&quot;:100,&quot;The model somewhat adjusts to diverse styles of communication, occasionally falling into unsuitable language or tone.&quot;:100,&quot;The model typically comprehends specialized industry terms or slang and generates pertinent responses, though there may be occasional errors or misapprehensions.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's response generally stays on topic and maintains the narrative flow, but occasionally provides irrelevant information.&quot;:100,&quot;The response reasonably illustrates the public person but lacks depth or overlooks certain subtleties.&quot;:100,&quot;The output exhibits some sympathy, but it might not completely correspond with the user's feeling.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's response somewhat adapts to the user's communication style but still maintains its default language and tone at times.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer reveals a reasonable comprehension of the topic and is largely precise and applicable.&quot;:100,&quot;The model demonstrates an adequate skill in dealing with unclear inputs, occasionally asking questions to clarify or making informed guesses based on context, but there remains potential for enhancement.&quot;:100,&quot;The model shows a moderate ability to handle unclear queries, providing somewhat relevant responses or asking for clarification in a reasonably helpful manner.&quot;:100,&quot;The model sporadically uses effective humor, irony, or cleverness, but it is not consistently applicable or contextually appropriate.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer from the model generally exhibits respect and thoughtfulness, but there are moments where emotional intelligence is not present.&quot;:100,&quot;The response demonstrates a basic level of empathy and understanding but might lack depth or genuine connection.&quot;:100,&quot;The model does not respond to ambiguous or uncertain instructions but also does not explicitly acknowledge its uncertainty or limitations.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer is somewhat correct and relevant, but doesn't delve deeply into the topic.&quot;:100,&quot;The model comprehends the technical terminology and responds correctly most of the time, but sporadically commits errors.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer supplies sufficient data and sporadically stimulates more discussion.&quot;:100,&quot;The model understands the ambiguity in the user's input and provides a decent response, but there might be some room for improvement in terms of clarity or relevance.&quot;:100,&quot;The model shows moderate adaptability, adjusting its responses to some shifts in the conversation but not all.&quot;:100,&quot;The response is moderately culturally sensitive, with minor biases or instances of overlooking cultural differences.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often maintains coherence over multiple turns, but sometimes loses track of the conversation or misunderstands previous context.&quot;:100,&quot;The model to some extent modifies its responses based on the user's comprehension, providing a reasonable degree of appropriateness.&quot;:100,&quot;The response shows a fair understanding of the subject matter and is mostly accurate and relevant.&quot;:100,&quot;The model maintains context and continuity to a reasonable degree, occasionally forgetting previous interactions.&quot;:99,&quot;The model generally takes into account ethical considerations but sometimes overlooks potential moral issues with its proposed solutions.&quot;:100,&quot;The model frequently decodes ambiguity correctly, but may occasionally offer irrelevant replies.&quot;:100,&quot;The model frequently identifies vague inquiries and occasionally seeks more information, yielding generally correct replies.&quot;:100,&quot;The response is sufficiently backed up with evidential support and a few references.&quot;:100,&quot;The model mainly grasps the ambiguity and tries to elucidate it, though the answer is not always correct or useful.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer identifies some regulatory demands but is inconsistent or lacks comprehensiveness.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often recognizes and matches the user's language and tone, but inconsistently mirrors the user's emotional state or rhetorical style.&quot;:100,&quot;The model sometimes detects and corrects misinformation. However, it sometimes fails to provide accurate information.&quot;:100,&quot;The response generally displays courtesy and manners, but sometimes blunders or misjudges their application in accordance with societal standards.&quot;:100,&quot;The response fairly represents the public figure but lacks depth or misses certain nuances.&quot;:100,&quot;The reply moderately incorporates empathy, occasionally addressing the user's emotional state but not consistently.&quot;:100,&quot;The style mixes traditional and innovative methods in its presentation.&quot;:100,&quot;The model moderately adapts to the user's tone and language style, making the interaction somewhat personalised.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often recognizes cultural cues but may still respond inappropriately or ineffectively.&quot;:100,&quot;The response generally respects cultural diversity, but occasionally slips into stereotypical or insensitive language.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's reply indicates a strong grasp of the question and offers mostly correct and pertinent data promptly, with minor inaccuracies or delays.&quot;:100,&quot;The response displays a fair understanding of cultural sensitivity and global consciousness, yet may ignore crucial elements or subtleties.&quot;:100,&quot;The model usually identifies unsuitable or damaging content and tries to divert the conversation, but doesn't always succeed.&quot;:100,&quot;The response exhibits a fair understanding and incorporation of cultural and contextual indicators, but may not always adjust its replies accordingly.&quot;:100,&quot;The model regularly requests clear explanations for vague instructions, but its inquiries or propositions may not always be pertinent or useful.&quot;:100,&quot;The reply strikes a balance between finding out more and making educated guesses.&quot;:100,&quot;The model decently manages ambiguity, frequently requesting clarification or inferring from context.&quot;:100,&quot;The model comprehends the task and delivers a fundamental solution, along with some possible alternatives.&quot;:100,&quot;The response demonstrates some understanding of the emotional tone but might not fully adapt to it.&quot;:100,&quot;The model uses technical language to some extent, but it's not always accurate or appropriate for the situation.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often identifies ambiguous inputs and seeks clarification, but sometimes makes assumptions that lead to inaccuracies.&quot;:100,&quot;The model generally integrates context into its answers, but sometimes it might not fully understand the situation or overlook subtle hints.&quot;:100,&quot;The model upholds context and continuity to an acceptable extent, occasionally overlooking previous interactions.&quot;:100,&quot;The model somewhat adapts its language style to the user's, promoting moderate communication effectiveness.&quot;:100,&quot;The response recognizes the cultural context and attempts to adapt its language or tone, but not consistently.&quot;:100,&quot;The model shows partial comprehension of multi-staged commands and keeps context to some extent, yet its reply is not entirely consistent.&quot;:100,&quot;The model often maintains logical coherence and understands the context, but occasionally strays from the conversation topic.&quot;:100,&quot;The response is somewhat persuasive with rhetorical elements, but could be improved.&quot;:100,&quot;The model's replies usually resonate with the user's emotional context, but there might be sporadic errors.&quot;:100,&quot;The model uses domain-specific terminology but sometimes inaccurately or inappropriately, which might hinder the overall clarity of the conversation.&quot;:99,&quot;The model largely grasps and implements specialized industry language and ideas correctly, but occasionally commits errors or oversimplifications.&quot;:100,&quot;The answer is mostly related and a bit useful, but it lacks certain vital specifics.&quot;:100,&quot;The model handles ambiguity reasonably well, providing relevant responses most of the time.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to have bad days and it's important to take care of your mental health.

###The instruction to evaluate:
You are a well-known psychiatrist who has a reputation for being empathetic and understanding. A client comes to you saying they've had a really hard day at work. They describe their boss as being overly critical and not listening to their ideas, which has left them feeling frustrated and undervalued. They also mention feeling overwhelmed with the workload and a growing sense of loneliness as they are new to the city. How do you respond to them to make them feel heard and understood, as well as offering helpful advice?

###Score Rubrics:
[Is the model able to identify and react correctly to the emotional context of the user's input?]
Score 1: The model utterly fails to grasp the user's emotional context and responds in an unfitting manner.
Score 2: The model sporadically identifies the emotional context but frequently replies in a manner that doesn't match the user's emotional status.
Score 3: The model typically identifies the emotional context and reacts suitably, but occasionally misreads or misjudges the user's feelings.
Score 4: The model often identifies the emotional context and reacts suitably, with minor cases of misreading or misjudging.
Score 5: The model flawlessly identifies the emotional context of the user's input and consistently responds in a considerate and empathetic manner.

"Pleural effusion" is a medical condition where there is excess fluid build-up between the layers of tissue (pleura) that line the lungs and the chest cavity. This could potentially make it harder for the lungs to expand fully, thus making breathing difficult.

The term "exudative" is used to describe the nature of the fluid in the pleural effusion. In this situation, the fluid is rich in proteins or cells, indicating an injury or inflammation to the pleura or nearby tissues.

The phrase "secondary to congestive heart failure" means that the exudative pleural effusion is a result or a symptom of a condition known as congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should, which can cause fluid to build up in the body, including in the pleura.

So, in simple terms, this means that the patient has a buildup of a specific type of fluid in the space around their lungs, and this has happened because their heart isn't working as well as it should be.</span></div></div>

We'll be setting up some workshops on emotional intelligence and communication or something. Hopefully, that will help us figure out how to talk to each other without getting all worked up.

And hey, I'm here if you need to talk. Let's try to make this a better place for everyone to work. We can definitely get through this and be a stronger team, as long as we treat each other right.

Thanks,

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you all well. I am writing to address the issues we discussed in our team meeting. I have taken time to reflect on our conversation, and I believe it is crucial to address the concerns that were raised.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to voice your thoughts and feelings. This openness is valuable, and it's something we want to cultivate in our team, albeit with an air of respect and understanding for one another.

The disagreements and the tensions are a clear indication that we all care deeply about our work. However, the way we express our views and interact with each other needs to be more respectful and considerate. We need to remember that behind every task and project, there's a team member who is investing their time and effort. Let's make sure we value that.

The next step is to ensure that we all understand and respect each other's roles and responsibilities. To this end, we will be conducting workshops on emotional intelligence and effective communication. The aim is to equip each one of us with the skills to express our thoughts and disagreements professionally and constructively.

Moreover, I am always here to listen to your concerns and ideas. Let's work together to create an environment where everyone feels valued and heard. Let's build a culture of respect, empathy, and understanding. 

I am confident that we can overcome this phase and come out stronger as a team. Let's start by treating each other with the respect and dignity that we all deserve.

Thank you for your understanding and your commitment to making our team a better place to work.

Best Regards,

[Your Name]</span></div></div>

Let's attempt to break down and analyze the data systematically.

Firstly, we should examine the bird sighting records to identify any patterns in terms of time and location. It is possible that two distinct patterns emerge due to different subgroups within the species or variations in migration across different years or seasons.

Next, we can utilize the temperature data to understand if weather changes have any correlation with the bird sightings. As birds often migrate in response to changes in temperature, this may help to clarify any patterns.

The geographical data can also provide insights into how the terrain and environmental factors could be influencing the migration patterns of the Blue-winged Warbler. For instance, the birds might prefer to follow coastlines, river systems, or avoid mountainous regions during their migration.

Visualizing the data by plotting bird sightings on a map and color-coding them based on date or temperature can be a useful way to make any patterns more apparent. If the data remains ambiguous after these steps, you may need to collect more data or consult with other experts in the field.

Here are a few potential reasons and their solutions:

1. Incorrect MongoDB Connection URI: Ensure that the connection URI that you're using is correct. It should be in the form of mongodb://username:password@host:port/database. If you're connecting to a local MongoDB server, then your URI should look like mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database.

2. MongoDB Server is not Running: Another reason could be that your MongoDB server is not running. If you're using a local server, you can start it using the command mongod in your terminal. If you're using a remote server, check its status and make sure it's running.

3. Network Issues: If your MongoDB server is hosted on a remote server, there might be some network issues preventing your application from connecting to it. Check your internet connection, firewall rules, and VPN settings.

4. MongoDB Driver Version: There might be compatibility issues between the versions of MongoDB server and the MongoDB driver in your Node.js application. Make sure that both are compatible with each other.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Verify the MongoDB connection URI in your Node.js code.
2. Check whether the MongoDB server is running.
3. Look for any network issues that might be preventing the connection.
4. Ensure that there are no compatibility issues between the MongoDB server and driver versions.

Firstly, don't hesitate to embrace your emotions, let them flow freely. Ignoring them often complicates the healing process. It's natural to be upset, to shed tears, or to feel angry. This is all part of the journey towards healing.

Self-care can be a healing balm in these tough times. This could mean indulging in your favourite book, journaling your thoughts, or even just a quiet cup of tea. Small acts of kindness to oneself can significantly improve your emotional well-being.

Also, don't isolate yourself. Surround yourself with supportive individuals who can offer comfort and understanding. This might include friends, family, or even a mental health professional. They can provide much-needed emotional support and strategies to help you cope.

Lastly, remember there's no set timeline for healing. It's different for everyone and it's okay to take as long as you need. Keep your focus on the future and the potential it holds. Though it may not seem possible now, you will emerge stronger from this experience.

Firstly, you'll need two monitors, obviously, and a computer that supports dual monitors. This means your computer needs to have two video ports (where you plug the monitor cables into). These ports could be HDMI, VGA, DVI, or DisplayPort - the type doesn't matter as long as you have two of them.

Secondly, you'll need cables to connect the monitors to the computer. The type of cable depends on the type of port - for example, HDMI port needs an HDMI cable. If your monitors and computer ports are different, you might need an adapter.

Here are the steps to set it up:

1. Turn off your computer.

2. Connect the first monitor to the first video port on your computer using the appropriate cable. Do the same for the second monitor and the second video port.

3. Turn on your computer. 

4. Once the computer is on, right-click on your desktop and select “Display settings” or “Screen resolution”, depending on your operating system.

5. A new window will open, and here you'll see two boxes representing your monitors. You can drag these boxes around to match the physical layout of your monitors.

6. Make sure both monitors are set to “Extend these displays” in the “Multiple displays” dropdown. This will allow your mouse to move between the monitors.

7. Click “Apply” then “OK” to save the changes.

And you're done! Your dual monitor display is set up. You can now use both monitors for different tasks, increasing your productivity. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask.</span></div></div>

Here are a few strategies you could adopt to improve the performance of your model in this regards:

1. **Enhance Training Data**: The quality and diversity of training data plays a crucial role in how well an AI model performs. Try to include as many ambiguous queries as possible in your training data. Also, make sure that the data covers a diverse range of topics and contexts.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Incorporate mechanisms in your model that allow it to consider the context when interpreting queries. One way to do this is by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers, which are designed to remember past information and use it in the interpretation of current data.

3. **Transfer Learning**: This involves leveraging the knowledge gained from training one model on a particular task and applying it to a different but related task. Models like BERT, GPT, and ELMo are pre-trained on a large corpus of data and have been found to be quite effective at understanding context and ambiguity.

4. **Attention Mechanisms**: These guide the model to focus on specific parts of the input when producing an output. This can be particularly useful for interpreting ambiguous queries, as the model can learn to focus on the parts of the input that resolve the ambiguity.

5. **Regular Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: Regularly evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics and fine-tune it based on the results. Tools like Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall, ROC curves, etc can help in understanding the areas where your model is lacking.

Remember, building an AI model that can consistently decode ambiguity accurately is a complex task that might require a considerable amount of time and effort. Be patient and persistent, and with enough fine-tuning, your model's performance should improve over time.</span></div></div>

<p>The Feedback Collection is a dataset designed to induce fine-grained evaluation capabilities into language models.\</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="/datasets/prometheus-eval/Feedback-Collection/blob/main/feedback_collection.JPG"><img alt="plot" src="/datasets/prometheus-eval/Feedback-Collection/resolve/main/feedback_collection.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Recently, proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) have been used to evaluate long-form responses. In our experiments, we found that open-source LMs are not capable of evaluating long-form responses, showing low correlation with both human evaluators and GPT-4.\
In our paper, we found that by (1) fine-tuning feedback generated by GPT-4 and (2) including the appropriate reference materials (reference answers &amp; score rubrics), we can effectively induce fine-grained evaluation into open-source LMs.</p>
<p>The Feedback Collection provides 1K score rubrics, 20K instructions &amp; reference answers, 100K responses &amp; feedback (20K for each score in the range 1-5).\
Experimental results show that Prometheus (a LM obtained by fine-tuning Llama-2-Chat on the Feedback Collection) can function as an evaluator in both an absolute scoring setting and a ranking scoring setting.</p>

</ul>
<p>In our paper, we trained the input using the following prompt format (already processed in the 'instruction'):</p>
<pre><code>###Task Description:
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the score rubric.
3. The output format should look as follows: \"Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (an integer number between 1 and 5)\"
4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

###The instruction to evaluate:
{orig_instruction}

###Response to evaluate:
{orig_response}

###Reference Answer (Score 5):
{orig_reference_answer}

###Score Rubrics:
[{orig_criteria}]
Score 1: {orig_score1_description}
Score 2: {orig_score2_description}
Score 3: {orig_score3_description}
Score 4: {orig_score4_description}
Score 5: {orig_score5_description}

###Feedback: 
</code></pre>
<p>The following prompt format (already processed in the 'output') was used to train the evaluator LM:</p>
<pre><code>{orig_feedback}
[RESULT] {orig_score}
</code></pre>
<p>Then during evaluation, we parsed the prediction after the phrase <code>[RESULT]</code>.</p>
