are the two stages of a startup's journey that you mentioned earlier?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Post product market fit and pre product market fit. So the game when you're pre product market fit is how little can you spend? How much of your company can you own? To reach the product market fit. The second place where we see this screwing up time and time again is when companies make a model from how their post seed round is gonna be spent. They only model out costs, they never model out revenue. So they come back to us and they say, well, we have to raise more money because we wanna hire these 3 engineers, and we have to get this designer, we need this, and it's gonna cost all this money. And we always come back and we say, okay, well, during this entire time that you're spending this money, you know, you're spending your c run. Are you going to make any money? Are you going to generate any revenue? Have you modeled how much revenue you're gonna generate? Have you thought about whether you should continue to hire people if you're not generating any revenue? You're not turning in revenue, doesn't that mean maybe you're not building something customers want? And if that's the case, is hiring your top priority? So the best founders spend time thinking about what will happen if things go right. They ask themselves, Am I in a extremely capital intensive business or am I not? If they're a capital intensive business, they realize they probably have to take a bit of a hit of dilution. If they're not, they don't chase their peers. They don't give a shit whether their peers are raising more money or not. They compete for how much little dilution they can take pre product market fit. These founders are very formidable. It's very formidable to interact with the founder who's thinking what if things go right. And you know, let's be clear, not magical thinking, not fake steve jobs, but very much thinking, What if we can actually get these customers to pay? What if they're actually paying a market rate? What if we can reinvest that revenue into growth? The founders who think that way are extremely formidable. Counter intuitively, investors both like those founders because they're formidable and dislike those founders because oftentimes they can't get as large of an allocation in their rounds. Want to or they can't get as much ownership or there's too much competition for their rounds. As a founder, you have to understand that, like, In many situations you and your investor have different motivations, and your investor is not motivated to preserve your dilution. To have low for you to have low debt, you have to be motivated for that. Okay. Next, there's a lot of talk about mental health and work life balance in the startup world and amongst founders, I wanna be honest with you, there is no work life balance. You balance implies some level of equality. And I guarantee you and some level of stability. And I guarantee you your startup will ask more from you than you will plan. It'll be harder than you plan. It will hurt more than you plan. That doesn't sound like balance to me. As a result is extremely stressful on your mental health. And failing at something for 2 years which is extremely common in the startup world is something that is extremely uncommon in the normal world. It's something that most founders have never experienced before. And so you need to think about what your plan will be for maintaining your mental health, early. You've gotta figure out how you are going to take care of yourself because no 1 else will. It's no 1 else's responsibility to take care of your mental health. That's your game. And there's even more burden on you because not only is it your responsibility to take care of your mental health, it's your responsibility to be an example to your co founders and your employees. So If you deal with stress by drinking, drinking will become part of the culture of your company, and you will hand that down to your co founders and your employees. If you deal with stress by exercising, then health will become part of the culture of your company and you will hand that habit down to your co founders employees. So the methods you use to take care of your mental health are your responsibility and your burden because they will be greatly shared with the people around you. Take this seriously early because the startup game is extremely long and hurts. Much more than most founders realize. All right here is my last 1 and this is the second 1 that I've come up with much more lately. Disciplined beats intelligence most of the time most startups know what they have to do and the best ones actually just do it. I think there's way too much talk in Silicon Valley and the kind of Silicon Valley ecosystem that's now global about intellect, about what school you went to how smart you are, not even what school you went to like how&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:17,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;17&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1119,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,119&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Secrets to YC's Essential Startup Advice with Y Combinator with Michael Seibel - Don't make decisions based on fear alone Take some time to think about what happens if things go right&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Post product market fit and pre product market fit. So the game when you're pre product market fit is how little can you spend? How much of your company can you own? To reach the product market fit. The second place where we see this...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How can startups improve their product and learn from their customers at a faster pace?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Faster that you iterate, the faster you learn from your customers and the better your product gets. So every time you think about specking a technical project, ask yourself this question. How do I get 90 percent of what I want for 10 percent of the work? Because if it turns out But the thing that I wanna build is what the customers want, I can always build V2 and be V3 and I can always iterate it and make it better. But if it turns out I'm working on something new customers don't want, how much time do I wanna waste building that thing before I figure it out? So this 9 10 solution can be applied to almost every technical problem that you're attacking. And I find it's an amazing conversation to have after you spec something out. After you write down this big spec with all these things. Is then you can start crossing things out and it's always motivating to a small team to be able to cross tasks out and only work on the things that are most important. Alright. Next, if you have raised money You should remember that this is not your money. You should always remember to spend your company's money with full transparency and high ethics. I've encountered this problem only a couple times after working with thousands of founders, but What is painfully obvious is that if you do something unethical with your company's money, eventually you'll be caught. Once you are caught, it will be very hard for you to ever work with ethical people in your industry ever again, so it's not worth it. It's not worth it. If you are not willing to expose your bank accounts to your cofounders, if you're not willing to walk through line by line spending with your Angel investors. You should ask yourself what are you spending money on that you shouldn't be. And you should stop. Now that doesn't mean that you should be reviewing every line of your expenses with your investors every week like let's be clear they probably don't want that, but&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:452,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;452&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Secrets to YC's Essential Startup Advice with Y Combinator with Michael Seibel - Do things that don't scale The superpower of every smal software startup&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Faster that you iterate, the faster you learn from your customers and the better your product gets. So every time you think about specking a technical project, ask yourself this question.

And you cannot beat them by playing their game. Oftentimes when I talk to YC founders, I cast this in terms of the American Revolutionary War. If you're George Washington and you're trying to beat the British, you do not march your soldiers in the middle of the field against the number 1 professional army in the world at the time. You will lose you will lose. You don't take the British on head to head. You fight something that looks a lot closer to a guerrilla war. Doing things that don't scale is another way of saying do things that big companies cannot or will not do. That's where you get an advantage over these larger incumbents. So counter intuitively, when you're looking to get your first 10 customers, when you're looking to figure out exactly what they want, you should be thinking about how you can talk to them directly, how you can have a relationship with them, oftentimes you put them into a WhatsApp group together, these are things that absolutely don't scale, but it's the things that the big incumbent cannot do. Which means you're learning 10 times faster than they are, you're iterating 10 times faster than they are, you're solving your customer's problems and you're growing. So Doing things that don't scale is essential and too many founders are trying to copy the organizations and the tactics of the large companies they're competing against. You will never be a large company by trying to attack them head to head. They will always have more money and more people. So figure out how you can play your Gorilla War against the large incumbent, and usually that means doing things that doesn't scale. All right, so finding the 9010 solution. This is something that Paul Buhai to YC founder I'm sorry YC partner came up with. This has been 1 of the most viable pieces of advice that I've used personally my startup. The very simple question you should ask yourself anytime you come up with a feature idea is how do I get 90 percent of what I want with only 10 percent of the work? Unfortunately, in the startup world founders are way to protect professional, sorry, are way to looking for something perfect perfectionists. And this is what is killing their speed. It's killing their speed.

And there's almost no talk about discipline. And I see founders almost embracing this by trying to communicate how well read they are or what schools they went to and, like, all these other things to try to signal intelligence because the way that Silicon Valley kind of shows off its most successful people is by calling them the smartest, right? Elon Musk is a smart assert. Mark Zuckerberg is smart. I actually think this is another extremely gross mischaracterization about what's going on. Almost everyone who's watching this talk right now and who will watch in the future will have gotten almost every piece of advice I'd given. They should take a second right now to ask themselves which of these pieces of advice they're not following and why? 1 of the things that I did in the beginning of COVID was start to ask myself Why don't I have better discipline in my life? I was working extremely hard and I wasn't really enjoying my day to day life and I was asking myself why not? And I came across this idea that like I wasn't being disciplined I knew what I needed to do but I wasn't doing it. I read this book named Atomic Hobbits. And the whole thesis of this book is that you can set very, very, very small goals and you can get into the habit of accomplishing these small goals, I call that discipline and those small goals can compound like interest over time to make massive changes in your life. So 1 of the core things that was described in that book that I loved was this idea that hard tasks are hard for everyone. Everyone finds things hard. The things that are on your to do list that are giving your US stomachache, every 1 of your peers, everyone else better than you in business that are all those things, they're gonna find them hard. Effective people figure out how to get good at doing hard things.

They took the right test, they applied to the right schools, so on and so forth. In college similarly, Also in the working world, most people are trying to figure out how to get ahead. So they try to attach themselves to the peers that seem like they know what's going on. So they basically are very driven by peers. The problem with the startup world is that failure rates are way higher than in the education world or in the corporate world. It's much more likely that your peers are going to die it's much more likely that if you just do what the people around you are doing, your company is going to die. In this world where Chap Capital is a lot cheaper than it's ever been before, founders are hiring way faster and starting to blitzscale way faster than they ever did, often when they don't have product market fit. And if everyone around you is doing that, your natural instincts the instincts that serve you so well in school or so well in the corporate world will fail you here. They are literally driving their startup off a cliff are you going to follow them? So be very, very careful about scaling too early. This is 1 that is deadly time and time and time again. Okay, this is a new 1. 1 of the things that I've realized with YC founders is that while on 1 hand, they're confident they're solving an important problem and they're building something that the customers want. On the other hand, almost every decision they make is based on fear at too high of a degree. So put another way they know they're trying their startup, in their startup, they're trying to do something that's very hard to do, like 4 to 9 impossible. Yet instead of asking themselves what will happen if things go right? Do I think that this will be a good decision if my company works? They almost always ask themselves what will happen things go wrong and then plan for things going wrong. So where do we see this most specifically? Dilution. Dilution is the first place we see this most specifically. Founders should be thinking that if their company goes well, their early rounds of financing will be the most dilutive. So in that world you have to ask yourself how much money should I actually raise? Now if I think my company, you know, if I'm I'm afraid my company won't do well, I'm gonna think to myself, I should raise more money early. It's gonna give me more time to figure things out. I mean, this is to say investors will tell you that over and over and over again. It's like you can't raise a million dollar seed round, that's crazy. If you want to get a Series A to raise 2, 3000000 dollars or more. To me, that's not thinking about what would happen if things went right. To me, those arguments from investors are self serving they want to own more of your company. And therefore, they're gonna try to convince you that taking more money is better. But the best YC founders when they come back and tell us what do they wish we had told them during YC? Time and time again, they wish we had told them to raise less money. They didn't realize that their startup would work. They didn't realize their startup generating revenue. They didn't realize they could start funding their company with that revenue and they oversold their company early. Now the average founder is competing with the size of their rounds, right? They're not competing for how much revenue they're generating. The average founder dies, right? So they have to try competing around how much money they raised or kind of valuation. The smart founders compete with how little dilution they take in the early days. To accomplish the goals. Because smart founders are betting on their startups working and they realize that capital will be a lot cheaper&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:906,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;906&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Secrets to YC's Essential Startup Advice with Y Combinator with Michael Seibel - Scaling too late is harmful, scaling too early is fatal.&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Look at your peer group in university or in high school, most startup founders interact with put themselves amongst the smart group of people and did something like what they did.

If you are, you're doing something wrong and you need to stop. It's extremely important. No 1 in your company is going to be more ethical than you are. So as founders you set the bar here, Alright. Now in the world of massive valuations and very little progress that we're in right now, it bears repeating over and over again that a high valuation is not equal to success. What I've come to learn nowadays is that valuations are largely a function of the amount of capital in the startup ecosystem. They are not a function of how good a company is. This is 1 that I struggle with constantly because I think what founders don't understand is that they determine the validation, the worth of their company based on what an investor is willing to give them instead of determining the worth of their company based on how much customers are willing to spend using their products. I really wish that instead of companies describing themselves as a series A or a series B or a series C or a unicorn, which is letting the investor define you, which is stupid because the investor almost never uses your products, doesn't know whether it's good or not. Why not describe yourself as a company with a million in revenue, annual revenue, or 10000000 in annual revenue, or 100000000 in annual revenue, or a billion in annual revenue. When you look at the unicorns that might be intimidating you, the competitors who've raised lots of money, instead of asking yourself how much money they raised or how big of valuation they got, why not ask yourself how many dollars worth of revenue do they have? And suddenly these massive unicorns might look a lot less intimidating. 1 of the things you have to understand as a founder is that you are downstream of a massive global economy that has decided to shift where it's investing money. And that massive global economy is trying to put more money into earlier stage companies and into technology companies because, to be honest, They have finally realized that software is revolutionizing business and they look at the public markets and see that software companies are doing very well. So there's a massive global capital inflow into the venture world. Now what does that mean? Right? Well it means that if every venture capitalist from seed stage up to growth stage has more money that basically means that there is much more competition between these investors in order to invest in the best companies. It also interestingly means that it's much less likely that 2 investors or 3 investors or 4 investors want to work together and participate in rounds together especially in earlier stages because they have more money to invest. If you see a great company and you have a large fund, why wouldn't you do the whole round? Why would you share it? So as a result, this increase this increase of capital flow into venture, which is creating increased competition is, as a result, creating increased valuations. Now unfortunately non sophisticated founders look at those valuations and they think to themselves that means something, that means those companies are good. And they stop looking at what's driving the valuations. Now for some companies these valuations are absolutely credible they've accomplished great work, their revenue is growing, they've got hypertension, so on and so forth, for other companies, not so much. So this is a useful 1 for people who want to be employees and executives in addition to people who want to be founders. Take a second to look beyond the valuation and figure out what are the core metrics of that business and how are those metrics improving over time, revenue, retention, Like look at the core metrics, do not assume that valuation is a good proxy for the core metrics that make a business work. Alright. Next up. This is 1 that is always frustrating to founders. You will need to fire some of your customers. You are going to acquire some customers who are not the right fit. And that can mean a lot of different things. These can be customers who Don't have the problem you're solving. These are customers who don't have the budget to spend on solving the problem. These are customers who are trying to get you to solve a different problem, customers who don't have the authority to make a purchasing decision, customers who don't understand how important the problem that you solve is to their company. So in the process of selling software early stage, a lot of founders defaults to the idea that they should try to sell any customer they meet. This is almost the exact opposite of what you should be trying to do. The reality is you should be trying to find the perfect set of customers. And I'm deciding perfect very specifically. The set of customers who have the problem you're trying to solve and it is frustrating the shit out of them. The folks who are willing to spend money to solve the problem, the folks that can move quickly the folks who are willing to endorse your product to whoever else inside of their company needs to believe in the product in order to actually get a deal done. The folks who are willing to use early stage software, right? A lot of people are not willing to be the first or second where they want to be late. They're the IBM vibes, right? So honestly a lot of what your job is is an early stage founder doing sales, is filtering is talking to a lot of customers and trying to find the customers who are in that zone. And then building a product for them. And what founders find frustrating is oftentimes those groups have early adopts who can move quickly might not represent the entire market, but it's who you should start with. So the advice we always give to YC founders is start with the easy custom easy as I defined and be okay ignoring or saying no to the harder customers. Once you get the easy customers on board, you have learned so much more about the problem. You will have so many more useful case studies. You will be so much better talking about the product that you make, then it's going to be a lot easier to sell the harder and harder customers. Put another way, the more resources you have the harder of the customers you should be focused on. The more you can pivot from filtering to actually selling, trying to convince But in the early days, it's all about filtering. Sales is all about finding the people who don't need to be convinced. The people who are&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:25,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;25&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1439,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,439&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Secrets to YC's Essential Startup Advice with Y Combinator with Michael Seibel - Find the 90⧸10 solution How do you get 90% of what you want with only 10% of the work？&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Real question is if they asked would you be afraid to?

So before you even have a fully functioning product, you get a chance to practice your pitch and you can refine it. You can AB test it and see how people actually respond to the idea. And then once you have an MVP or a very early version of your product, launching through different channels will give you an opportunity to see how people will respond to that early version of the product. You know, and then launching to different channels will help you determine whether you're even talking to the right users. Because, you know, you might launch on 1 channel and get no response. You'll be launched on another channel, and you'll get a huge response. And so that will help you identify whether, you know, you're identifying the right user for what you're building. So let's talk about some of the types of launches that you can do while you're in start school. And I'm excited to hear that, you know, a thousand of you have launched so far since a start up of start up school.

But I I wanted to skim them briefly and give you an example of a company that we worked with that did it very well. As most of you know, launching to popular blogs that cover your industry or trade can be incredibly powerful. So Joy is a free wedding website builder, and they were 1 of the fastest growing companies in their batch. And a lot of their early growth like an alarming amount of their really early growth was due to being placed on a number of lists like this. They essentially googled. They looked at, you know, SEO, and they googled, you know, best wedding website builders and figured out who was coming up on, you know, first couple pages of results on Google, and they reached out to all those bloggers. And, you know, they said, hey, we have this new product, you know, we think community. Would love it? Would you be willing to add us to this list? And they, you know, they said that they reached out and basically did a drip campaign to over 50 of 50 bloggers and only got responses from 4, but those 4 responses made a huge impact for their early growth. So 1 note that I want you to keep in mind is that some blogger and influencer opportunities are pay to play. And Joy did not pay early on, and I do not want you paying early on either. If folks are asking you to pay, please find other or creative roots to get around this because as startups, as early stage startups, you just don't have, you don't have the money to do it. And so I'm it is definitely possible to go this route without paying a ton of money. So figure out, you know, wait routes around the expensive sort of sponsorship dollars. If you're a hardware or physical product, of course, you can do a pre order campaign. So, you know, at pairing for the order launch could honestly be a whole presentation of its own. But take a look at some successful campaigns and get a sense for how they built out their launch strategy. So for example, SheerText was a company NYC that was making unbreakable sheer pantyhose, the founder Catherine made a great, really compelling video She pitched press. She launched on Hacker News, where, you know, Hacker News is probably, you know, it's a very male audience. So, we were curious how how they would respond to something like sheer, you know, unbreakable pantyhose, but they loved it. They thought it was very clever. They thought, you know, they the technical piece behind it was really interesting. And, you know, so so I would recommend, like, any company, you know, try to launch and and see how different communities respond. She launched a product hunt she asked her friends and family and batchmates to and investors to help spread the word. And&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:25,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;25&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:674,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;674&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - Social media&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;So we don't have a huge amount of time because obviously social media and launching to bloggers is this huge and long and well covered topic.

And so, of course, there's the new feature or new product line launches. So 2 very different companies that do this incredibly well are Stripe and Gossier. So both companies are incredibly smart about how they launch new products. So Stripe has always been great from the very beginning. They've been really great at engaging the community. So every time they launch a product so for example, when they launched Stripe Atlas, they launched it on hacker news, and the founders were in the thread talking to all, you know, potential users and and talking about the product and why they were launching it. The problems that they felt it was solving, they blogged about it, They spread the word on social media. They pitched press. And this is something that they do over and over again. If you look at Stripe's blog, if you look at Hacker News, you can kind of see the history since the beginning. They've been very great at sort of activating the community. Glossier, which is a, you know, a beauty brand, is incredible at launching new product. And the way they think about it is actually very scientific. They release products on a very specific cadence at specific intervals, And for every product, they essentially hit every single launch button again and again. So community, social media, press advertising, So each time this they, you know, these new product launches, which is basically, like, every 6 to 8 weeks, they have this cycle going. So there's a constant drum beat. About glossier out in, you know, out in the world.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:19,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;19&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:364,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;364&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - New feature launch&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;She had an incredibly successful campaign.

The biggest piece of advice I have for launching on online communities is write like you talk. Do not talk like a marketing robot, People hate that. So don't use marketing language or deep jargon. Talk like a human when you're addressing the community. So all you need in these, you know, when you introduce yourself in these posts, introduce yourself, talk about what you're building, talk briefly about why you're doing it or how you came across the problem. People on Hacker News, for example, are super intellectually curious. So are there any interesting insights that you've learned from talking to potential users or your users? Is there anything surprising or delight full that you could share with the community because people love that. And they also wanna ask you questions, but sometimes don't know exactly how or which questions they should ask you. So tee it up for them, say, hey, I'm an expert in x y and z, and I'm happy to answer questions on these topics. Otherwise, you risk people going down all sorts of weird rabbit holes. But so and just make sure, like, that you sort of are sharing this community asking and asking them for advice try to cut down as much of the jargon and marketing as&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:279,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;279&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - No jargon&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Community yourself.

The request for access launch, the magic story that that I shared with you actually reminded me of this other type of launch you can do. So when Magic launched, you know, overnight, they got 40000 people signing up. And, of course, they couldn't serve 40000 users immediately. So they launched a waitlist. And they also gave people ways to skip the line. So, for example, if you tweeted about magic, you'd get, you know, to skip a few spots in line. So you can build these viral elements into your launches that will help get people to spread the word for you. 1 of my current favorite examples of this request for access launch is superhuman. So superhuman is building a better email experience. So you can go to their site here and request access. And you can also ask a current user to refer you, and then that'll help you skip the line. So in the signature of all emails that are sent by superhuman users is a little tag that says sent by superhuman. And so I'm a superhuman user, and I get a ton of emails. Like, I'll send a ton out of of my emails out to people and I get a ton of emails asking me for referrals. So, you know, people I email say, hey. How did you like superhuman? Would you mind referring me to the product So if you have a product that you can build this sort of viral element into, I highly recommend it.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:21,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;21&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:337,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;337&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - ＂Request access＂ launch&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Out of these pitches.

I'm a partner at Y Combinator, and 1 of the things I help founders do a lot is prepare to launch. That is what I'm gonna talk to you about today. So I want to change the way that you think about launching. So most people think about launching as something that you get 1 shot at. But I so for example, I just talked to a team that's been preparing to launch for 6 months. They were lovingly trying to get every Pixel perfect on their product before they shared it with everyone. And now they are stressing over every line on their landing page, and, you know, they're trying to line up everything right with timing, But if you're like most startups, you will launch something, and no 1 will care. And if it took you 6 months to get there, you your start is probably gonna be before you get another chance to launch. So in the same sort of spirit, I'd always be shipping. I want you to think about launching as than you can continually do. I wanna destroy the idea that launching is just this 1 moment in time because assuming you do well, and assuming you ship new products and new features, you are never going to be not launching. So, let's talk about all the ways that you can&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:19,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;19&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:296,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;296&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - Expect to launch more than once&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm Emmanuel.

And you this you can do this even really pre product. So there was 1 Yc founder, Daddy Avron, who was founder Sometria, and he had a really particularly successful TechCrunch launch. A TechCrunch launch is, you know, a story about what they were doing launched in TechCrunch. And I noticed that they had a ton of shares, a ton of engagement, So I asked him to share, you know, how did you set this up? What did you do to share and spread the word about your launch? And he said that over the years, you know, even before launching the product, he started to build his own email list. So every person he met that he discussed his startup with, even, you know, even very loosely. He would add them to an email list, and they would get, you know, sort of email updates about what he was working on on a semi regular, like, at semi regular intervals. So when the TechCrunch article came out, he said he sent that email to the list full of all the people that he'd, you know, he'd ever talk to other startup founders, investors, friends, family, and asked for their help in spreading the news. And he said the response was significant. And he's even saw VCs who hadn't invested in them sharing the story from their own personal Twitter accounts. And he said, you know, you would be really apprised by who comes out of the woodwork to help when you ask for it. So, I would recommend while you're in startup school, you have the opportunity to talk to so many people about what you're building and start and ask them, hey, can I add you to my update list? And over time, you know, that you'll get that into the hundreds, maybe maybe even thousands. So I would definitely recommend that you start doing that now. And so to sum up, I want you to stop thinking about launching as this 1 moment in time. I don't want you to spend all of startup school getting ready for this 1 big day, this 1 big launch day that you're trying to line up all these things for. This is something that is a continuous process that you can do over the course of the next couple months and into the life cycle of your company. If you didn't catch them the first time, these are all the opportunities that we went over. And I'm Kat. So if you ever have any questions, it's Demodays coming up, so I might be slightly slower than usual to respond, but you can always reach out to cat at y Combinator, and I'm also on Twitter.

So this is what I call the silent launch, and you do not need anything fancy for this. You know, all you need is a domain name, your company name, a short description, a contact and a call to action. So for example, this is a random startup school company that I found from a founder who'd posted on the forum. Their company is Zinc. They have, you know, a domain name. They have their company name. They have their, you know, short 1 line pitch a short description, and they're called to action, which is get in touch. The call to action can be something like, you know, subscribe to our newsletter or subscribe to hear more when we launch. Product hunt, for example, has an actual product for pre launch companies called Ship. And it's a way to collect potential, like, interest from potential users. So for example, this is something called designer school. And it has a quick intro from the founders, a short description of what the company does, and a call to action, which is subscribe. So, you know, you can go on product hunt and set up 1 of these pages. But, of course, you can also build your own landing page incredibly quickly and easily.

So 1 of my favorite examples of a YC company launching launching to strangers is the company Lugg. So Lug is an app that lets you call movers and delivery people on demand. So even before Lug had built a fully functioning app or product, they would rent a truck and they would go drive to IKEA, and they would sit outside of IKEA. So they would watch shoppers and they'd look people who were having a particularly difficult time tying stuff to the top of their cars. And they'd run up to those customers, and they'd say, like, hey, Instead of trying to tie this mattress on top of your car, wouldn't it be cool if you could just push a button and someone with a truck would come and help do this for you? And the customers would be like sweating, and they'd be like, yes. That's that's exactly what I need at this moment. And, you know, they'd hit they'd download the app they'd click the lug button, and then the founder would run back to the parking lot, drive up in his truck, and then the the customer would be like, oh my god. It's you. And and they were like, you know. So it was a real hustle at the beginning. Like, none of this was working on the back end, but it really confirmed for them that this a hair on fire problem for their users and customers. And so they decided it makes sense for us to really build this out and spend time, you know, on this product. So launching to strangers will help do that for you.

So Lug is an app that lets you call movers and delivery people on demand....&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the next step after testing out your short pitch on family and friends at the idea stage?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Do this weekend. So the next thing is the friends and family launch. So if you're at idea stage, you can test out your short pitch on family and friends and see how they respond. And once you have an MVP, do a friends and family launch as quickly as possible. So in its earliest days, Reddit was shared just among the founders of their Bat y You know, there were only 8 companies. It was a really small community. I used the way back machine to actually see what Reddit looked like in its earliest days. It hasn't changed that much. But if you look closely, this is actually before they called up votes, up votes. They were calling it boosts. This is, like, 2005 in July. So that's how they got their very first users, just sharing it among their community of founders. And so, you know, What I recommend you do is share the product with your friends and family, watch them use it, you know, sit down next to them and ask for feedback. But don't stay in this phase for too long because your friends and family might not be the exact right, you know, ideal user for your product or what you're building. And so sometimes their feedback isn't quite as helpful as a real user's is. So for example, you know, if Alexis and Steve had shared this with their parents, their parents might have been like, what the hell is this? So you get, you know, get out of that know, family and friends circuit as fast as you can.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:21,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;21&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:336,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;336&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - Friends and family launch&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Do this weekend.

This is actually 1 of my favorite ways to launch. I think you should plan a launch for every single community that you are part of. So when a company goes through Y Combinator, they have the option of launching on BookBase before they launch publicly. So Bookface is our internal platform at YC. It's like Facebook meets LinkedIn, meets Quora, and there are currently over 4000, you know, other founders on Bookbase. So it's a fairly low risk way to launch, because it's it's not totally public, but there is enough of an audience there to get some feedback And you're launching in front of, you know, fairly friendly people who, you know, wanna see you succeed. And so they they launch there. And what I think you guys are particularly lucky, because you have startup school, and you have the startup school forum, which about 40000 founders are on. So if you have an early version of your product, there is literally no reason that you shouldn't be launching to the startup school community in the next few weeks. And so, you know, I also think that founders and other people making and building stuff, they give the best early product feedback. So you have thousands of other founders at your disposal. So I think that, you know, that this kind of gives you a leg up here. Here's a sort of extreme example of a company that successfully launched in online communities. So magic is an on demand personal assistant. When they started in Y Combinator in 20 15, they were actually building a blood pressure monitoring app. They were trying to get this blood pressure monitoring app to grow, and it wasn't growing as quickly as they were hoping. So they decided, you know, let's test out another idea. That we had. So they sent a link around for their friends and family, and it just looked like this. It basically said, like, Texas phone number, and we'll make anything happen like magic. Like, it was very, very basic. And their friend 1 of their friends thought it was so cool that they shared it on Reddit and Hacker News. And basically overnight, like, over the course of a weekend, 40000 people signed up to use magic. And so, of course, they were like, oh my god, this is crazy. And and let's let's be honest. This is an extreme case, and almost no 1 who launches on Reddit and Hacker News is going to get 40000 users overnight. But my point is it's definitely worth putting yourself out there because, you know, you might be 1 of those, like, extreme cases, but at the very least, you'll get some early users, and you'll get some great feedback. So many of the startups that go through YC launch on Hacker News and Product Hunt. And, you know, we over time have looked at the stats of how well these launches convert. So a tech crunch launch versus a product hunt launch versus a hacker news launch. And in terms of converting to users, you know, they're starting to even out in terms of their impact and and conversion for, you know, whether it's, you know, your sign ups or, you know, converting to customers. So if you're launching in these communities and aren't active members of these communities yet, I my suggestion is that you spend a little bit of time looking at the communities. You understand the rules, especially if you're if you're posting to subreddits. Right? They all sort of have their own moderators have their own rules, understand the best way to talk to to these communities. And if it's a community that's known for being helpful, ask for advice, ask for feedback. If you're not part of these communities, I'd reach out to someone who is and ask them for advice. Ask them for the best way to launch because there are going to be tips for every community. And, you know, for example, 1 company in this batch you know, was building something that he wanted to get more, you know, women's perspectives on, and and there are, you know, 2 male founders. And 1 of the users of Alpha, which is a community for women in tech, said, hey, I'll post that to Alpha for you, and I'll tell you what kind of feedback they got. So I recommend like connecting with someone in the community and asking them for help if you're not part of&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:11,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;11&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1019,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,019&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Launch (Again and Again) - Online communities&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Let's talk about online communities.

You can also ask follow-up questions and please learn how to make use of these ones. It's very hard to get someone to say everything and just 1 answer to 1 question. Get comfortable with asking questions like, what do you mean by that? Or can you tell me more about that? Or why is that important to you? Here are some questions that you should not ask. There are ways you can kind of derail this interview. Will you use our product? They're probably gonna say yes. But they're not gonna mean anything to you in that answer. 2, which features would make product x better? Remember, their job is to tell you about the problem, your job is to think about what features to solve that problem. So ask asking them about your job isn't really gonna Yes and no questions. It's not really that helpful for you. You want them to explain and give you as many concrete and real examples possible. Just simply asking yes on the questions is not ideal here. And 4, how would would a better product x look like? You? How would a better carbon emission accounting software would it take to you? Many of the people aren't product developers. They're not software engineers. They're not designers. They're not product managers. This is not their job. Their job is to do a different job. You are the 1 trying to understand what is the challenging part about their job? And finally, asking 2 questions at the same time. This is going to confuse them and it's going to confuse your answers. So this is when you're eager to get get answer is very easy to do this this thing but try to avoid it. But I want to highlight 1 of the things I mentioned here. There's 1 big danger to me to view that is to focus on features instead of problems. It's very natural for you to do that. Your your brain is thinking through all the ways you're gonna solve this problem. But really what you hear for here in this interview is to deeply understand the problems not actually come up with solutions. That's for for for a separate event. So users generally have good problems but also generally bad solutions. So I'll give you 2 specific examples. So early days of Gmail, users were asking Paul Buchat, the founder of Gmail, to view both the inbox and the actual email that they were reading on the same screen. Now why would they ask for that? Well, the reason was simply that Gmail is too slow and people did not wanna wait to load each of the emails in the inbox. I want to see everything at the same time. Similarly, in early Airbnb, a lot of guests wanted to have the phone numbers of the host so they can call them. And we're like, why do you need that? It just turned out that they didn't fully trust the platform. Like, we had not displayed enough trust in Airbnb so they needed to feel comfortable with getting to know the host before actually making the booking. Secondly, users don't have incentive to say no to really any additional features. If you ask for this feature or this feature or this feature, they'll probably say yes to everything. Right? You, however, are in charge of the organizations and you have a lot more incentives than they have to figure out which are the most important of the features. So let's talk about next steps. So you've done your 5 or 10 of these user interviews. You've written down your notes. Let's let's talk about what you do then. 1, you wanna make sure you have notes from all each of the interviews. You can use sticky notes or some similar software to organize these learnings can bucket them in different buckets that kind of describes different problems and and see which 1 is actually the thing that matters the most. And then you wanna write down your conclusions, what are you learning from all of this? You want to use all of this information to create a hypothesis or what the solution to this problem might be. Don't over intellectualize this process. Really, you just want to start signing MVP as fast as you can, but you want to make sure you have accurate information when you decide the MVP. And then you want to test it with the same users. It's also important to know if the problem you solve is actually valuable. What I mean by this is that people will value the solution to the problem enough to pay for or the problem itself solving the problem is valuable. So here are some good tips to determine if it is. 1, are people paying money for other solutions in this face today are the people that make the PDF reports for carbon emissions accounting, are they getting paid? Well, if they are getting paid, that's a good sign. That this is probably a valuable thing. Do people already have solutions to this problem they are very happy with? Even though it might appear basic to you, for example, like Excel or Google spreadsheets, is actually competitors to many, many, many, many hundreds of startups. Actually quite a formidable 1. To move someone off excel or Google spreadsheet, you need to make the experience of your solution dramatically better. They're not going to pay you hundreds of dollars a month for something they can almost as easily do in Google spreadsheet or Excel. And 3, you want to evaluate how easy it is to sell to this audience. And this is 1 thing that I like to do a lot with the companies I work with. For example, selling to plumbers or contractors is notoriously difficult compared to selling to startups. The first 2 groups just don't change their tools or the software very often versus start ups are open to trying new things all the time. So If you are solving a problem as valuable, you still have to think about whether it's gonna be easy to solve this particular audience. 1&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:23,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;23&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1298,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,298&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Talk To Users ｜ Startup School - Follow ups &amp; Don't ask these questions&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Card.

Even if it's just a design prototype in an invision or something like that, you can just click through We used to do this therapy all the time. We go downstairs in our in our office. We would find some people that were waiting for an interview or waiting for getting a coffee or something. And we just show them the latest version of of the app. This would be an in vision prototype on our phone, ruby's Play. Hand them our phone and and and show it to them. This is stuff that we haven't even dealt yet. The key thing, but if you're doing this tactic is to not tell them what to do. Not tell them what to do. Just watch them play around with it. You can tell them a specific goal like try to make a booking at Airbnb or try to do a search with dates on Airbnb or something like that. But do not tell them exactly how to solve each screen. Remember, if this was a real product, you wouldn't be standing the next to them to give them advice. Another good trick, when you're doing this, either when you're listening or having them or or recording them is to have them speak their mind while they're doing it, have them describe exactly what they're thinking on each of the steps. Maybe the words that they're reading, maybe that will give you hints of what words do they understand and which words do they don't understand or maybe what specific screen means or what purposes. And after you've done a bunch of these interviews and then maybe MVP sessions, it's a great idea to keep these these interviewees involved throughout the process. 1 common idea that a lot of licensing companies are using is to create a Slack instance or a WhatsApp group with their customers. Now, you want to make them feel special, right? You want to make them feel like they have exclusive active access to the future world changing product. So Think about how you are wording or or or how you communicate this WhatsApp group that you add in them to. It's a great idea to keep showing them your product up as they are progressing. Then kind of give them this exclusive feeling that I'm the first 1 to see this product product as it's progressing. And also, as you are reacting to things that they're saying, you can ship a new a new screen with a new version of the product. And that builds trust with with them, they now know that you react to their feedback very fast. Finally, some of them will love connecting with other people doing the same thing as they are. They don't get to do this very often and you are the 1 enabling that. If you do all these steps you will collect the right information from your future users, you will keep them involved and translate the information, and that allow you to translate the information into a first prototype and MVP.

They think ideas of new products is something the financials come up with on a lacy Sunday or a late night coding session. You'd probably know, it doesn't work this way. This scene, as you can see here here, is a scene from the social network movie. It's a great movie, but they got a lot of things wrong on how Facebook actually got started. This is Brian Chesky. Brian is the co founder and CEO of of Airbnb. On the left side of the photo is Amal. Amal was the very first guest on Airbnb. They actually spent a weekend together in San Francisco when they would be kind of watched. You notice the difference between this photo and the previous photo Well, this photo actually is a real photo, it includes a 2 way conversation with a real customer. Great founders talk to future customers before they even have a product. In fact, the very best founders in the world learned directly from their users throughout the life of their company. But that's in again. If you have correctly identified who the users are, you should learn from them throughout the lifetime of your company. Why? You might ask. Users and customers will keep you honest. They are the only stakeholders actually paying you anything. If anyone will tell you the truth, it will be them. So my talk today is about how to do this well. So let's talk about another Airbnb story. In 20 10 and I remember this myself, Brian Chesky the CEO of Airbnb. He'll decide to launch an experiment. He was going to give up his apartment and live in 50 different Airbnb over the next couple You might ask yourself, why would anyone do that? So much hassle. Most people who read the articles about this experiment because he did announce it, they missed a point. I personally remember this being kind of crazy. By doing this, Brian will literally get a chance to talk to every 1 of these 50 hosts each single day on his trip, and 1 incredible source of honest feedback on your product. Without the Airbnb hosts, MB would not exist today. What Brian Joe and Nate did so early is deeply understand the motivations and the feedback from their hosts. Still today, Brian and Joe gets calls from hosts on their personal cell phone numbers. I remember them telling me that on their first day I worked at Airbnb. Why do they do that? Well, it's the number that they put on the website and share with all of their hosts early on. There weren't hiding behind anonymous email that wanted to hear from the customers. At the time, this seemed almost radical, most founders would spend their time in front of the computers trying to find scalable growth channels like Google Ads. Unfortunately, most founders still don't build personal connections with their users today. Behind behind info at emails or don't do not reply emails. You don't believe me? You should just do a search in your email for do not reply at and see how many people don't want to talk&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:25,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;25&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:684,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;684&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Talk To Users ｜ Startup School - Best founders learn from their users&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;People in the world have the idea on how new startups are formed completely wrong.

So let's start by trying to figure out who I should talk to. It's always easy to interview people that you know or people who are on your network They're simply the most likely to respond but perhaps can be less honest in their answers to not offend you. Don't be afraid of reaching out to them and don't be afraid of rejection. The second group here is coworkers or former coworkers. They can be a really great source. They might know the topic really well, and if you're building software for startups, you can easily let and easily navigate yourself to someone who's a potential user. It's also very common that the early users you speak to are outside of your personal circles or your coworker circles. When asking Wisei founders how they found their early users, some of the most common answers were LinkedIn, Red forums, Slack, or Discord communities, and sometimes in person events. So to illustrate this process a little better, I'm going to start a new mock startup. This is not a real company, I'm just making it up. But I'm going to go through the process as I would have if this was a real company. And first, I want to understand if the problem is real. My hypothesis that I have here or kind of like the idea space that we sometimes call NYC, is that companies want to reduce their carbon emissions but for whatever reasons don't do that. So my plan is very simple. I want to first interview some potential customers 2, learn about the problems and motivations around carbon emissions. And 3, try to understand what an MVP will look like. MVP is a mineral viable product. To do this research, I plan to start by reaching out to founders, CEOs, CFOs, at startups, or or bigger companies. I'm also going to reach out to people on LinkedIn to have titles like carbon or climate or sustainability, basically, worse that gives me a hint that there might be relevant people to talk to. So what am I looking to learn? Well, first, I'm trying to understand, do the company that they work for care about the carbon emissions. And 2, why do they care and why do they not care if they don't care? And 3, Who in that company might be the 1 who cares the most about this and why. Alright. So so here are 2 examples of outreach messages. So the first 1 is a LinkedIn message to a CFO who I used to work with at Airbnb, the message will go something like this. First, I introduce myself I mentioned something about our time it ever be. Then I say, I'm starting a new project, briefly describe it but not too much in detail, and I just ask for a 20 minute phone call or a video call. That's it. And here's another example of a message to someone I don't know. It's also on LinkedIn to the same group that I mentioned earlier. It's similar, but geared towards people I don't know. So the message will and the tone will be a little&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:22,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;22&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:692,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;692&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Talk To Users ｜ Startup School - Who should I talk to？&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Customers.

I I mean, I do wanna emphasize that this is not really something that I I advocate or or this is not prescriptive. This is simply pre hopefully predictive. Because who will some say, well, Like like this is something that I want to occur instead of so there's something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe somebody else can come up with a better approach or or better outcome is that we achieved democratization of AI technology, meaning that no 1 company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, you know, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation. I think if you've got any any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's who's gonna control that. So it's not as I think that the risk is that the AI would develop the role of its own right off the bat. I think it's more that's the consumers that some someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or or and even if they weren't gonna use it in a way that's bad, but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad. That that I think is quite a big danger. I think we must have democratization of AI technology and make it widely available. And that's, you know, the reason that, obviously, Umi and the rest of the team you know, created Open AI was to help with the demographers help help spread out AI technology. So it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. And and but then that course, that needs to be combined with solving the high bandwidth interface to the cortex. Humans are so slow.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:22,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;22&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:433,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;433&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Elon Musk ： How to Build the Future - What does the positive future for AI looks like and how can we get there？&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Okay.

I actually at the time in college, I I sort of thought helping with electrification of of of cars was was how it was set out. And that's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra capacitors with to see if they there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in in cars. And then when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing. My grad studies on is was was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And then I put that on hold to start an Internet company in in 95 because there there there does seem to be like a time for particular technologies when they're at a a steep point in the inflection code. And and I didn't wanna, you know, do a PhD at Stanford, and then and what should all happen And then and and I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would actually succeed. You can get you can get a, you know, doctorate on many things that ultimately are not do not have a practical bearing on the world.

It's kind of like the your your instincts and whatnot. And then the cortex is the thinking of a part of the brain. Those 2 seem to work together quite well. Occasionally your cortex and limbic system may disagree, but they It generally works pretty well. Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who I I've not found someone who wishes to either get rid of their cortex or get rid of their limbic system. Very true. Yeah. It's that's unusual. So so I think if if we can effectively merge with AI by improving that that the the the neural link be between your cortex and the the the digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then then effectively, you become an an AI human symbiote And and if that then is widespread with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well. We don't have to worry about some sort of evil dictator AI because kind of we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of?

So now that we've talked about how to define primary and secondary KPIs, how do we set targets? Assuming growth is your primary KPI, How much growth is enough? This depends on your business and your stage. But in Paulgram's classic essay about growth, He notes that for a company going through YC, 5 to 7 percent week over week is growth is good and a 10 percent week over week growth is exceptional. As I've said a few times now, small changes in weekly or monthly growth growth rate Really compound and make a difference in the long run. So early growth is better than late growth if you can choose. That number on your bathroom mirror per Airbnb story reminds you to focus on this early. Here are a few factors that might impact your growth rate that you might wanna keep in mind. First, latent demand might boost early growth. Perhaps some early users will be willing to put up with an inferior product experience because you're solving an urgent need. But that growth rate might be tougher to sustain later. For enterprise businesses, the length of your sales cycle might be This should go up down over time, but it might impact early KPI in goal setting. In these cases, you can set goals around other process metrics for example, leads in different stages of your funnel. Another thing that might be impacting your growth rate is whether you're doing organic or paid user acquisition. Early on, organic is ideal. You should know where to find your first few passionate users and talk to them directly and ideally have them spread the word. You can also run paid acquisition tests so that once you have a product that's growing organically, and a sense for payback period, you can crank out the ads crank up the ad spend to drive growth. But please, don't do this too early and don't leak money on this stress. Actually accidentally. The last thing I want to talk about on this slide is retention and engagement. We get a common question. Should we focus on getting new users? Or focus on retaining our existing users. The short answer to this is you have to do both. The slightly longer nuanced answer is that both will impact your revenue growth. So get a sense for which one's gonna have more impact. First, make sure you don't have a problem with churn and that your user are sticking around long enough to pay back their acquisition cost, and to tell their friends, you don't wanna bring new customers into a substandard product. But beyond that, of course, focus on bringing in new users. Ultimately, both these metrics will need to be strong to sustain a healthy revenue growth. To share another example from Super Daily, early on, they realized that the acquisition numbers were tracking were not reflecting a healthy growing business and could be artificially boosted due to paid promos. To protect against this, they switched their track metric from sign ups, which was too easy to gain, to tracking customers who'd who'd placed 5 or more orders since they saw this as a leading indicator to customers that were very likely to become long term revenue generating customers. This helped the super daily teams align their marketing and their overall revenue goals to chase top line revenue&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:21,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;21&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:721,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;721&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - How to Set Targets&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;At once.

Number 1, write down any ideas that you might have to hit your goals. Don't start working on them right away, it's really easy to chase shiny new things. Just write them down. Next, you want to rank by probability of success, and then subrank with respect to complexity or how long it's gonna take you to do this task. Pick only a couple of things to try. Once you pick a few tasks and start working on them, If your KPI isn't moving, be really honest about why. Ask why several times until you feel like you can actually understand the real reason. Even if it's hard to hear. For the example of super daily earlier, it might be something simple like the milk brand. Do retros in your weekly initiatives. Are you predicting impact and complexity well? Did you complete all the tasks you were expecting to complete in this sprint? If not, next time, break them down more. Give yourself time blocks to reduce context switching, or maybe did you accidentally work on some of those fake progress tasks we talked about? Just do better next time. And then move fast, learn, and then do something differently the next time if what you did didn't work. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Don't let indecision slow you down, just pick a path and keep moving. Ideally, you're gonna be growing fast. If not, talk to a lot of users fast, churn through your bad ideas fast, so that you can get to working on the right good ideas as fast as possible.

When setting targets, there are 2 possible approaches, and you can and actually should do both. Your first option is a top down approach. Set a goal or a milestone that you need to reach sometime in the future. For example, 5000 dollars in MRR by the end of startup school. Back into that weekly growth rate that you need to achieve to achieve that longer term goal. The Airbnb demo day example is a great example of this. Set a target and obsess over it. Compounding matters, so getting an early start helps a lot. Your second option is a bottoms up approach. Ask yourself, what do you think is realistic for you to get done in the next week? Then you can project out from there. As a thought exercise, when doing a bottoms up goal setting, you can ask yourself, what could we achieve with unlimited funding? A lot of people in their heads think that funding is a bottleneck, so let's remove that. What could we do in the next week with unlimited money or resources? Then ask yourself, What creative ways can we still achieve that even with limited funding? Set your goal. Between top down and bottom up, Either's actually fine. I recommend periodically doing both to see whether what you're doing is realistic, achievable, and ambitious at the same time. Just make sure that you're checking to make sure that you're always on track to build a big business and aren't accidentally ending up in that no man's land of underwhelming but consistent growth. Let's talk a little bit more about some non revenue KPIs that may be tempting, but not always right. First, CAC to LTV ratio. You might hear these buzz words together. These are generally concerns kind of later in your business, but they usually come post product market fit once you have a fundamental business that you know people want, and then you need to reliably scale your user base. So for now, we recommend you only worry about payback period. Ideally, your payback period is 0, as in 0 dollars spent on CAC, so customers are profitable on day 1. If you do need to spend on CAC or unpaid acquisition, get a sense for how quickly users pay back that CAC and whether you're reliably hitting it. Does your retention rate make this work? LTV can really be a rabbit hole for early stage companies and it's really hard calculate, so just make sure your payback period is reasonable, and you're making money per user. A second tempting KPI I wanna talk about is free sign up or daily active users. I'll start by saying this, paying customers will have very different expectations for a product than for than free customers will. So if you plan to charge for your product eventually, don't mess around getting feedback from free customers. It'll likely be the wrong feedback. Get paid from day 1 or at least don't count those users as part of your growth. The main exception here is from marketplaces are products that have a strong network effect and need volume in order to have utility. Uber is a great example of this. Without enough drivers on the platform, the user experience was not good enough for riders to pay a premium for. In these cases, sign ups or GMV can sometimes suffice if no rent revenue is being generated yet. I have a couple of stories of start up spending too much time on sign ups and shifting to revenue too late in the game. Scribbed was an early YC company that went through in summer 2006. They spent their first 4 years primarily growing a free product, and they were afraid of losing their millions of customers if they started charging. As you can see in this graph in year 5, so remember, they started in 2000 in mid 2010, they started charging. And while they did lose over 90 percent of their customers, Their revenue grew by infinity percent. They finally had a business. And while scribd already had millions of users, it wasn't until they started charging. That they started to really learn what their paying users wanted.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:13,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;13&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:924,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;924&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - Setting Targets - Top Down &amp; Bottom Up&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;New growth.

Set a goal or a milestone that you need to reach sometime in the future. For example...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Why is setting KPIs critical for prioritization?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Okay. So step 1 for prioritizing. We're gonna talk more about how to set KPIs in the next section, but I wanna talk about why this is critical for prioritization. So first, you need to identify your top KPIs. If you've launched, your primary KPI should be revenue growth. If you don't wanna make revenue growth, your primary KPI, you need to really push yourself on why. We talk more about this later in this talk, but this is important enough to mention here. A non revenue KPI is rarely the right 1, and we'll talk about a few exceptions later. If your prelaunch, your KPI is in the short term, might be weeks until launch, or number of conversations with users. But once you do launch, please quickly shift shift your KPIs to revenue growth. Second, you need to decide, what's your KPI goal for this week? We'll talk about goal setting later, but assume that you have some goal for example, 10 more paying customers by next week. Make sure this ladders up to any longer term goals that you have. The reason setting the right KPI goals is critical, is that it'll remind you of the urgency of growing fast. Early growth compounds, and tracking goals weekly reminds you of this. Here at YC, we talk a lot about the early days of Airbnb, where the founding team rode their weekly KPI goals on their bathroom mirror, so they were facing that reality multiple times a day. In addition to identifying the right KPIs, you also need to identify your biggest bottleneck or problem in moving your top KPI. Here's an example from a YC company called Super Daily, a daily grocery subscription service in India that sold to Swiggy in 20 18. Super Daily faced a scenario early on when they launched v 1 of their product. There were a ton of things to be optimized. You guys picture this business. It's operationally complex. With the mobile app, ops tooling, inventory management, and a whole lot of messi on the ground logistics. But their north star was growth. And they were able to see clearly that their bottleneck was the conversion of users who actually got pretty far down the sign up flow and then churned. So they asked themselves, why are high intent users not converting? That was the biggest problem they needed to solve, and the first tasks they prioritized were conversations and experiments to understand this. By focusing on this question, they realized that high intent users were dropping out because a lot of users wanted a specific milk brand that Super Daily didn't carry. It wasn't a UX friction issue or an app issue. So they onboarded that milk brand rather than beautifying their sign up screen. Once they solved this, then they started looking at how to convert users that were maybe farther up the funnel or lower intent, you that were referred by word-of-mouth or people that were casually checking out super daily. So by the time those users got farther down the funnel to the highest intent phase, they now had that top milk brand on the app and they knew that they weren't optimizing a funnel that would leak farther down. By onboarding this new brand, Super Daily was able to increase their conversion rate by 50 percent&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:13,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;13&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:745,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;745&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - Setting the Right KPI Goals for Prioritization&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Okay. So step 1 for prioritizing. We're gonna talk more about how to set KPIs in the next section, but I wanna talk about why this is critical for prioritization. So first, you need to identify your top K...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:46,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some things that should and should not end up on your task list for early stage startups?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Decision. So as a sanity check, here are some things that should and should not end up on your list in most cases. Since we're talking about the 90 percent case here, and specifically talking about early stage startups. Here are a list of example tasks that you should see on your task list. Talking to users, then building and iterating based on user feedback. When you're spending time talking to your customers and responding to support emails, There is a direct path to revenue growth. The only way you know what your customers want is by talking to them all the time. And the only way to grow is by building something people want. Not much else is gonna help you at this stage. Here are some things that should not end up on your task list. Hey, hey, fake progress. Passive fundraising conversations or coffees when you aren't actively raising. When you do decide to raise, it should be deliberate, focused, and time boxed. Conference attendances, other than a few select industries, this generally won't move your needle at an early stage. Third, arbitrary technical milestones. Spending time optimizing technical benchmarks, launching an Android app, Unless you're hearing clearly from your users that this is a burning pain point, this is probably fake progress at this point. You guys, this fake progress list it's not anything to be ashamed about. Smart people put these things on their list all the time. We've all done it. These are all tasks that can make you feel good. They boost your ego, they're metrics that you can brag about on LinkedIn, they might make your mom proud, they might make your ex boyfriend jealous, But what they don't do is they don't necessarily get you closer to product market fit. Here are some common tricks your brain plays on you when you're trying to prioritize. These are tricks and traps that your mind has to help you avoid negative feelings like shame, despair, embarrassment, self doubt, many people are drawn to low leverage tasks. Why? They provide a sense of accomplishment. They allow you to check things off your list and it's so tangible. At a time when your startup's future is uncertain, there can be so much satisfaction in checking tasks off a list. Don't fall into this trap. Here are some examples of this. Spending too much time optimizing paperwork or on licensing, incorporation, equity, this is not an area where you need to optimize or innovate. Just follow the standard advice to stay legal and compliant. Slightly cheaper workers' comp insurance or a slightly better equity structure is not gonna make or break your business. Taking meetings with potential investors, advisors, partners, or building cool hard features that you don't know people want yet, Again, these things can make you feel really good and really smart. Solving hard problems is awesome. Unfortunately, it's not gonna help you find product market fit sooner. It's just gonna be things you're checking off a list. The second mental trap I wanna talk about is that sometimes you can fool yourself into thinking something is working when it's really not. Be honest with yourself. It doesn't feel good to admit to yourself, or your teammates, or your investors, or your mom, that things aren't going well. But you're not doing yourself any favors by not diagnosing problems early and often. Slow growth can be deceptive. It's easy to mistake slow growth for product market fit. As someone that's worked at both kind of slow steady growth companies, my own startups, and companies with clear product market fit, like DoorDash, trust me, you guys, these types of growth feel fundamentally different. Third trap I wanna talk about is perfectionism, or indecision blocking progress. When nothing seems to be working, it's really easy to make every decision feel like it's gonna make or break your company. In reality, Most decisions don't matter, and for the ones that do, it's okay to decide wrong first and then fix it later. Just keep moving. So the best case scenario, you know, the 1 you can put in a pedestal is a scenario where you make the right decision quickly every time. This is completely impossible. No one's gonna achieve this. I recommend the second best option, which is to make pretty good decisions quickly. And then if they turn out to be wrong, fail, learn and switch to what's working quickly. As a startup founder, you have dozens of decisions to make every day. Don't waste time on the ones that won't help you get to product market fit. Remember, if it's a tough call, it actually probably means you can't go wrong. So pick 1, keep moving. The fourth mental trap I wanna talk about is spending too much time on downside instead of chasing upside. Downside protection is straightforward and satisfying, fixing little problems is very easy. But rarely where the innovation happens. Chasing upside requires risk taking, creativity, a lot of false starts, So get in as many iterations as you can. For example, we hear a lot of ops teams talking about getting themselves out of spreadsheets. Y'all at this stage, spreadsheets are fine until they're not. If they're working, stick with them. It's good to do things that don't scale as long as they're not breaking. Instead, spend your time finding out what your users need in order to use your product every day instead of once a week. That's the upside chasing that we're talking about. The last trap I wanna call out today is chipping away at small problems when there's a big existential 1 looming that maybe you don't wanna face. For example, you may tell yourself, hey, my 150 users are asking for 1 click ordering. Let me go build it. You guys you only have a hundred and 50 users. This is a problem. Maybe you've only had a hundred and 50 users for the past 3 months and they're starting to churn and no 1 knew is signing up. That's your biggest problem. Go solve that. So here's a quick recap on prioritization. You'll never get to everything on your task list, You have to use KPIs to prioritize your work and only work on the biggest blocker to your primary KPI, and be honest with yourself, and&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:22,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;22&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1455,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,455&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - 5 Things That Should &amp; Should Not End Up on Your Task List&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Decision. So as a sanity check, here are some things that should and should not end up on your list in most cases. Since we're talking about the 90 percent case here, and specifically talking about early stage startups. Here are a list...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the importance of choosing the right KPIs for a startup and how can it help in avoiding wasted time and resources?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fail fast. So now let's talk about how to choose the right KPIs. Remember, we can't afford to waste time running fast in the wrong direction. Let's define primary and secondary KPIs. Your primary KPI or primary metric is the main metric you use to measure whether your business is on track. For the vast majority of startups, your primary KPI should be growth and ideally revenue growth. This indicates that you've built something people want, and you're on track to building a huge business. As we've mentioned, there are a few exceptions to this, for example, Maybe a marketplace business might choose sign ups or GMV as their primary KPI. Or an early enterprise business with a long sales cycle might choose letters of intent. Secondary KPIs are things that need to be tracked, moving in the right direction, to make sure you're not cheating on your primary KPI. Or to give you an early signal when your primary KPI is very lagging. Here are some examples of secondary KPIs. Retention and churn, These are gonna actually contribute to your revenue growth, so they're very important to track. Unit economics. You need to make sure you're making money on each user and not giving away free money and calling it growth. Customer acquisition cost, depending on your stage, you may not need to optimize this right now. Just have a sense for your payback period and whether you'll make or lose money per customer acquired. Keep this list small and relevant. 3 to 5 secondary KPIs is reasonable. I've also included a short list here of vanity metrics. As we discussed earlier, it is very easy, even for good founders. To fall into the trap of prioritizing for these metrics. They feel good and they provide external validation. If you find these creeping into your task list, just ask yourself. Is this directly on my path to revenue growth? Is this my biggest blocker? To illustrate what a laser focus on growth looks like, I dug up some examples. Here's a side by side comparison of DoorDash on demo day, which everyone knows, and my own startup, Rick Shaw. Which was also a delivery platform. We went through YC right after DoorDash did, and DoorDash eventually acquired Rickshaw in 20 17. Both companies had a laser focus on order volume as a top line metric. This allowed for clear focused execution and resulted in strong and very similar early traction. However, post demo day, the path diverged a little bit. Rickshaw had a bit of trouble fundraising despite comparable early traction to DoorDash. This caused us to make a decision out of fear, and instead of continuing to have a clear focus on top line growth, as DoorDash did, we tried to optimize for both growth and unit economics. We tried to hedge, and this was very dangerous. This split focus put us in a weird no man's land of slow growth, which, as we described before, can kill startups. There's a lot more nuance about profitability versus growth that I won't get do here. The main message today is to choose your primary KPIs and don't try to get smart and optimize for 2 or more hard things.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:29,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;29&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:725,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;725&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - Choosing the Right KPIs for your Startup&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fail fast.

I'm Divia, and today I'm gonna talk a little bit about KPIs and prioritization for an early stage startup. This is my second batch as a visiting group partner here at YC. Where I've worked with hundreds of founders on hitting their demo day goals and navigating goal setting and execution as they search for product market fit. I myself am a 2 time YC founder and have also held leadership roles at several fast growth startups. Just as a heads up, I'm gonna be giving you some homework at the end of this talk. My hope is that today, we can improve the way you spend your time and expedite your journey to product market fit. So why are we talking about this? Now that you're a startup founder, there is nobody telling you how to spend your time. You might have heard some version of and not or. Implying that you have to turn over every rock and optimize every metric to build a successful startup. While this is true to some extent, you still have to choose how you're going to spend your time each Ultimately, as a startup founder, you wanna get to product market fit as quickly as possible. Prioritization matters, and having clarity on your KPIs is crucial for prioritization. Let's start by defining these terms. KPI stands for key performance indicator. These are the metrics that you track and report on, both internally and externally. These metrics make sure that you're measuring what matters, and they tell you whether what you're doing is worth prioritization tells you in what order you need to tackle your work each day. There are infinite things you could be doing each day, and your work is never done. But time is finite. Prioritization tells you how you spend your time each day, how you direct your team to spend their time each day when you have 1, And most importantly, prioritization helps you decide which super important things on your list you don't get to today. Here's what your task list may look like. Note that the highlighted items in yellow are the ones that I might decide to prioritize. Also note that every item on this list feels important. Yet only a few are likely to truly move your business forward and toward product market fit. In a world where you can't possibly get to everything, you need to prioritize the tasks that'll move you toward your KPIs faster. So why are KPIs and prioritization in 1 talk? Well, prioritization means that you're working on the things most likely to impact your top KPIs. So it's critical that you choose the right KPIs and that are honest with yourself about which tasks are most likely to move those KPIs. When you're moving fast, it's extra important to make sure you're running in the right direction. I'll use this analogy a few times today, so look out for it. We come across companies all the time who are working so hard, but optimizing for the wrong thing. We call these vanity metrics. Things that make you feel good and things that you can brag about on LinkedIn. At the end of the day, if you fall into the trap of making these your primary KPIs, you're going to be spending your time on the wrong things. So why are KPIs and prioritization important? Well, as a founder, no 1 is gonna tell you how to spend your time. It's very easy to feel busy and feel productive and not be moving your business forward. Here are some common examples of things you can be doing to feel busy today. Optimizing paperwork tasks, maybe we're good enough is all that you needed, perfectionism and craftsmanship on a feature that nobody's using anyway. Premature optimization or building for scale that you don't need to yet or choosing a more intellectually hard problem to solve rather than building what your users want. I remember in the early days of 1 of my companies, we were trying to pick a legal firm to work with. Sure, you need a lawyer and you need to pick need to pick a good lawyer. There are so many to interview, and so many of them wanted to take us out to lunch or to drinks, have us visit their offices, the works? You guys, this felt flattering and glamorous, we felt so busy. But at the end of the day, we hadn't even launched yeah, choose a good lawyer. No. This is not impacting your KPIs. Do it quickly and move on. Again, it's easy to run fast but in the wrong direction. You need to run fast and be running in the right direction. When you're doing a start up, time is at a premium The faster you get to market, the sooner you earn money and you can reinvest that money in your business and be less dependent on outside capital or Even if you want to keep raising, you'll have more leverage to raise money on better terms. Taking more time to get to market means you burn more money. Lastly, moving slowly means that competitors have more time to copy you and catch up. Time spent without making real progress also has an emotional and mental cost. And can raise red flags externally in fundraising and hiring. So don't waste time on&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:26,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;26&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1163,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,163&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - KPIs and Prioritization for an Early-Stage Startup&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Good morning.

So let's talk about how to prioritize. There are 2 ways we can talk about prioritization. 1 is how you spend your time on your startup versus other things in your life. Listen, guys, I can't tell you this. This is a very personal decision. This depends on what else is going on in your life and how you wanna spend your time. This is a whole separate topic that we won't spend much time on today. That said, I have 2 important points. 1, remember, speed matters, and 2, this is an area where it's really important to align with your co founder on expectations. When we discuss prioritization, we mean How do you spend the time you've allocated to working on your startup? Let's make sure that you're doing the most impactful things with your valuable time.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:24,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;24&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:195,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;195&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Setting KPIs and Goals ｜ Startup School - How to Prioritize Your Time in the Startup&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Things that don't matter.

So by that we mean You should be able to build it fast in weeks not months. This can either involve software or honestly we see startups just start with a landing page and a spreadsheet, but most startups can start very, very fast. Second, extremely limited functionality. You need to condense down what your user needs, what your initial user needs to a very simple set of things. A lot of times founders want to address all of their user's problems and all of their potential users. When a reality, they should just focus on a small set of initial users and their highest order problems. And then ignore the rest and so later. You should have a vision of everyone. You should have an MVP very small. All this is is a base to iterate from. That's it. It's just a starting point. It doesn't it's not special in any way. You just have to start.

If you can walk away from 1 thing from this presentation, it's launch something bad quickly. That's it. Like, literally the rest of what I'm gonna say is base gonna be re summarized versions of that same thing. The second thing that an early stage startup needs to do is get some initial customers. Get anyone using your product. You don't have to have a vision on how you get everyone using it, but just anyone interacting and seeing if they get value out of the product. You'd be surprised at how many founders' journeys and before a single user has actually interacted with a product they've created. It's very very common. So please get past this step. It's extremely important.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:220,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;220&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - Goal： launch quickly&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Okay.

First, time box your spec. So your spec is a list of stuff you need to build before you launch. Timebox it. Say, okay. What happens if I want to launch in 3 weeks? Okay. Well, the only things that could be on my spec are things I can build in 3 weeks. That makes your life a lot simpler. It allows you to remove all the features you can't build in 3 weeks. Second, write your spec This seems really straightforward, but most people fuck this 1 up. It's really easy to change what you're working on before you ever launch it because you never write it down. You start working on something, you talk to a user, they say, oh, I would never use that or God forbid, you talk to an investor, and they say, oh, that could never be a company. Because investors know everything. And so you decide to change what you're working on. And because you never wrote it down, you don't even really realize you're changing it. And so your 3 week plan turns into a 3 month plan. If you write shit down, at least you can be honest with yourself that you're changing your spec all the time. The next 1 is cut your spec A week into your kind of 3 week sprint, you probably realized that you added too many things to your spec and you're not gonna make your deadline. That's okay. Just cut the stuff that clearly isn't important. And if there's no nonimportant things, start cutting important things. Most of the goal here is just to get anything out in the world. Once you get anything out in the world, the momentum to keep anything going is extremely strong. Once you have any once you if you don't have anything on the world, it's very easy to just delay delay delay delay.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:16,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;16&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:417,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;417&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - Hacks for building an MVP quickly&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Finally, some hacks for building an MVP extremely quickly.

I just invented that term heavy MVP when I made this presentation 2 days ago. So maybe becomes a thing. If you're in an industry with significant regulation like insurance or banking, sometimes drones, although sometimes not It's hard to launch. It's it's harder to launch. You have to pass through a bunch of regulatory bodies first. If you're doing a hard tech, if you are building rockets, it is hard to build a rocket in a couple weeks. Biotech, it is hard to invent a cancer drug in a couple weeks. Moon shots. Well, fill in all the other blanks. It's hard to bore tunnels in the earth and have extremely fast vehicles that replace cars in a couple weeks. So if you're in that situation, please remember that your MVP can start with a simple simple website. That explains what you do. It's helpful when you talk to people and you're active people that they can refer back to something. So that can be your start and you can build that simple website in days, not weeks.

This is 1 that's also extremely common mistake because most founders in their heads have a idea of what they want to build And so they kind of have this weird feeling that if I haven't built the full thing yet, getting feedback on the shitty initial thing is kind of useless. Of course, it's not gonna work. It's not the full thing. The full thing's gonna take 3 years, 10000000 dollars a whole team. So feedback on the little thing is useless. The reality is that in some ways the full thing is this really awesome idea in your head that you should keep in your head, but it should be very, very flexible because it might turn out the full thing that you wanna build isn't what your customers want at all. So I have this saying, hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer, tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely. And last most important, iterate. And I like to kind of distinguish between iterating and pivoting. A lot of founders once they've figured out how to build something fall in love with it. And so if it doesn't work for a certain set of users, they start thinking, well, I wonder what other problems this thing can solve. Well, you know, the screwdriver is not actually good at screwing in anything. But I wonder what other problems it could solve. And they're like, oh, maybe you can use it to cook. Maybe you can use it to clean. And it's like, no. Like the problem was I need to screw something in. The user was like a mechanic, And if your screwdriver doesn't help the mechanic solve the problem, keep the mechanic, keep the problem. I need to screw something in, fix the fucking screwdriver. Like, that's the thing that's broken. Right? The broken thing is not the mechanic, and it's not the fact that they need to screw something in. So iterate. Continue improving on your solution until it actually solves a problem.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:488,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;488&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - After launching, get feedback&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The next 1 is talk to your users, any of them, after you've launched this MVP and get feedback.

This doesn't mean you have to go into a 3 year kind of research situation or you have to work in industry for 10 years. But some conversations are helpful. It's even more helpful if you're your own user. So you can tell whether your product's working for you. I always get this strange question of how do I get my first users? Which always kind of confuses me because theoretically you decide to solve a problem that you know someone has, So the way you get your first user is you talk to that person that you know has the problem. And if it's you, it's even easier. So if you are building a product for a mysterious set of users that you have no idea who they are, question that slightly.

So MVP We always yell at founders to not use jargon yet we have this whole set of stupid startup jargon and MVP is 1 of them. When you think about MVP, you should think about something ridiculously simple. This is the first thing you can give to the very first set of users you wanna target. In order to see if you can deliver any value at all to them. That's all it is. It's extremely simple.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:169,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;169&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - Introduction&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It's Michael.

They see big companies launch stuff and they assume that's what startups do. In fact, they see companies that kind of think about like startups. Facebook's not really a startup anymore. But they see them getting a lot of press and getting a lot of buzz and yada yada yada, and they have in their head that that's what a successful company looks like when they launch. Well, let me ask you this question. How many here remember the day that Google launched? No. How about Facebook? Okay. How about Twitter? No. Great. So it turns out that launches aren't that special at all. Okay? So if you have this magical idea of your magical launch you wanna do, throw it away. It's not that special. The number 1 thing that's really important is to get some customers. So to make people feel better, let's use different terms. How about launch is when you get any customers. And how about like press launch or press launch really impressive is when like people write about things and it's all exciting and you get all this buzz. Let's push the press launch off and let's push the get any customer's launch really, really soon. That's our goal here. It's a lot harder to learn from your customers when they don't have a product they can play with. You know, you can talk to your customer all day, but you have no idea whether thing you want to build can solve their problem. If you put the thing in front of them and it doesn't solve their problem, you know right away. And so all the research in the world is good, but until you can put something in front of people, you have no frigging idea whether it's gonna work. So spending all that time on a pitch deck is not as valuable as spending your time building anything that you can give to a customer.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:440,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;440&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - Launches aren't special&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Now I want to talk about launching for a second because a lot of founders have this misconception about launching.

Okay. Here is a classic example. This is 1 of Airbnb's first landing pages in 2008, I believe. 1 of the things that you might be interested in about in Airbnb's first product is that there were no payments. When you found a place to stay on Airbnb, you had to exchange money with the host in person. Needless to say, that was a pretty fucking big problem, but they started without payments. No map view You know how when you search Airbnb, you can see where the house is in the city. You don't have that. Sorry. And the person writing all the code Nate was working part time. Okay? So everyone tells these kind of magical stories about how everything was perfect from the beginning. Airbnb, not perfect from the beginning. Next 1, Twitch. This was what Twitch looked like day 1. Not very familiar. Well, maybe a little familiar. There's some video there and there's some chat there. Other than that, nothing else. Twitch launched as Justin TV, which was a online reality TV show. There was only 1 channel, Justin. You had to follow his life. If you didn't like his life, you had to leave the website all there was. The video was extremely low resolution. It was funny. A founder asked me back in the day like, oh, like wasn't it weird you guys had video in your apartment? Weren't there all these like secret documents and things that like people would be able to see and it was like you could barely recognize our faces let alone documents that we had. And most importantly, there were no video games. No video games except if we decided to play video games in our apartment like that's the only time video games ever appeared. And so needless to say you can do that quickly. When you think about Twitch, it's much more complex now. Last stripe, which wasn't stripe. It was called slash dev slash payments because why not? Like let's make a name that's really easy to remember. This was Stripe day 1. No bank deals. I won't tell you exactly how they process payments, but It was in a very start up y way. Almost no features and even cooler if you wanted to use Right? The Stripe founders would come to your office and integrate it for you. How nice is that? Half because they were just desperate to get 1 to use it and half because there's great way to find bugs before the users found bugs. Integrate yourself. So these are just 3 examples of extremely simple, extremely fast to build MVPs. All of these are billion dollar companies, and they all started with something that most people would say is pretty shit&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:24,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;24&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:617,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;617&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Plan an MVP - Real-world examples&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Special.

Simple Is everyone incorporated? Yeah. And and everyone dealt it incorporated as a C corp and everyone in Delaware. Okay, you should fix that. Like, it's so much easier to fix right now every minute you wait, it becomes harder to fix. I've raised money from probably Let's say a hundred investors. If I wasn't a Delaware C cup, none of them would have given me any money. So And I'm sure you wanted some of my investors. Maybe not all of them, but like a couple. Ashton Kutcher invested, if I want Ashton Kut as an investor. You're not a Delaware C Corp is not gonna invest. So just change that. You can use Clerkey if you guys ever heard of Clerkey Clirky is like super easy incorporation, so on and so forth. Okay. So I won't I won't belabor that point more.

I used to think that you could just execute well and not have to be able communicate. But the problem is that startups really require good communication, communication with your users, communication with potential investors, with your co founders, with potential employees. In effect a founder always has to be talking about their business and getting people excited about it. The number 1 mistake I see founders making is they can't actually explain what their business does. The best founders can in 1 or 2 sentences explain exactly what their business does and they can explain it to a customer, they can explain it to an investor, They can explain it to their mother. They could explain it to anyone of any level of knowledge about their industry and they can do it without stumbling. And I think that's ridiculously important because in order for you to get advice, investment to convince someone to join your company, they first have to understand what you do and you would be surprised how many founders can't clearly explain what they do well enough so that they can start selling you on how you can help them or join them. So once again, the 3 most important things I see that's separating our top 10 percent founders from anyone else is first, it's good to execute. Second, the resulting formidability you kind of respect them more. And third their ability clearly communicate what they're working on.

You're gonna make bad decisions all the time. You're gonna have strong hypothesis that turns out to be wrong. And there's a type of person who doesn't get discouraged even if they make the wrong move 5 times or 5 times in a row. They stay passionate about the problem. They stay passionate about trying to find a solution. They keep on executing and moving forward. Being motivated in the face of defeat or failure, is an extremely important thing for a startup founder to be able to do.

It doesn't mean they want to continue down that direction. But they never get stuck in the execution step.

And so when you talk to them, you treat them with more respect you treat their goals with more respect because you think they're more likely to accomplish them and you treat their task with more respect because you know they're going to do them.

And so what I did was I posted I don't know if you saw,...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:70,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the general consensus among startups regarding whether or not to raise funds?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Focus. Now, there is a question as to whether should you raise or not. Right? Very few companies don't raise, but Zapia, for example, never raised after YC demo. And I think because the business is so good, it's growing really well. They are EBITDA positive. They have very healthy margins. And, you know, often Wade would tell me this, like, I don't know what to do with my money in the bank. Why will I raise more? It's a great reason not to raise. Right? But if you are not in that luxurious situation, then, you know, there is something to be said about, I need capital to grow. Not necessarily for paid marketing. Don't please don't take this as paid marketing. This is another common mistake. But more like I need to hire more engineers, I need to hire ahead of time to build the things that I need because I know I have a business model at the end of it. So therefore, the way to think of fundraisers, if you think you are you you have a clear path to the next milestone, and you may need, like, you know, maybe 205 hundred or 1000000 dollars, then just raise that minimum amount, but come up with that plan very clearly. What is the money you need to hit that next next milestone and just raise that money because guess what your dilution matters? That's perfect.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:326,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;326&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How Investors Measure Startups Q&amp;A - Should I raise or not&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Focus.

Yeah. So This is probably a really high bar example, but I'll say that, which is the Brex founders, Enrique Pedro. It was The second time they were building a company so they knew that they needed to do this. I I don't know if they did this in their first time, probably not. But When they were going through YC, they actually literally iterated from a VR startup idea to Brex, right, which is corporate curve cuts. And they had built FinTech in the past. But the both of them knew the stakes were high at least for them because they were dropping out of Stanford. They literally came out of Brazil to attend Stanford. They were dropping out at the university. And so they both wanted to make sure that Brex had a big opportunity. And before hiring a single person, they wrote down very clearly what Brex could be with all the products that they could build in the road map. Tested it for not like it was not a huge survey, but they just wrote it down to really understand, built a financial model, and we actually attended accounting class in Stanford because he had no idea how to build it. And he built a whole model year by year, tested the assumptions of market demand and what penetration they would need to hit for it to be at least a billion dollar company. And only after they after they both got comfortable that there is a path. And this is worth quitting stand for for and putting our entire life probably for the next 10, 15 years on this, they hired the first employee. That's is an amazing clarity of thought. Right? You I'm not saying everybody should be there, but you should at least do the first exercise. What is if you were to convince someone to join you, who and, you know, more often than not at this stage, whoever you want doesn't want to join you.

You should do it yourself. And so if, you know, if you're a product person, you really love product, don't hire a VP of product. Keep doing that because if you hire a VP of product, you will have never any conflict because you both want the same thing. And you won't like the way they do it. They won't like the way you're interfering with them, whatever. So or if you what you really love is finance, which some of our CEOs do. Don't hire a CFO, do it yourself and, you know, hire a controller. So whatever you think the critical piece of the business is the 1 or maybe 2 most critical pieces, hold on to those yourself that will also make you better about delegating everything else.

Acquosition. So a lot of people think that if you go to investor and you've done a bunch of book or Twitter or Google ads, and you show your CAC and LTV that you will able to prove that you have a sustainable sort of acquisition model. And I want you to know that if paid acquisition is the only way that you are able to grow your company, then I'm gonna discount that channel of growth greatly. That is because if you actually get really popular, you've actually start being someone significant, let's say, becoming a hundred million dollar revenue company. Then you're gonna attract a lot of competitors into space. And that advantage is gonna quickly dwindle over time. Blue Apron is a really good example. Of this. Almost all their acquisitions is in paid and then once they ate through that, there's almost nowhere else for them to sort of go. You want to find acquisition paths that cost no money. And my favorite companies, the ones that become really great are the ones that can grow by word-of-mouth. This is a good percentage of the way they grow. And so in the early days of your startup, if you don't have any money, that's actually very great way of exercising how do I grow this without having to pay for it? And so in the beginning we tell you to do things that don't scale. But this is what you sort of want to accomplish. It's like do I have an advantage that is free? And&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:22,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;22&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:345,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;345&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - Acquisition model&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;And numbers and pricing.

It's a hypothesis about why a company could grow quickly. And your job is to figure out how to construct your hypothesis, basically, the pitch to the investor so they understand how it can go grow quickly. A lot of times people make the mistakes of trying to just accurately describe or over describe a lot of different parts. So I'm gonna break it this down. So just like a normal hypothesis has a pretty decent structure for this. This will hopefully help you sort of workshop like understanding, oh, this is exactly all the reasons why this should succeed. And so even before we start even building anything, we can have an understanding of like, oh, here's the potential path of this company, or here's the things I need to prove to show that this company could do well. So the first is the problem. So startup ideas come out as a 3 part, the first part is a problem, and it's basically the initial conditions. You have to explain to me like, what is the setting for this company? That allows it to be able to grow quickly. The second is the solution. So this is basically what is the experiment that you're basically running? Within those conditions for it to grow really quickly. And the third is, what's your insight? So what's your explanation why The thing that you're going to try, your experiment is going to end up being successful. Those are the 3 components that I'm always trying to figure out when I'm listening to someone's pitch. Here's a tip for talking about the problem, or to know whether your problem, your initial conditions are correct.

What will determine whether I'm gonna win the Lotto is a miracle belief that like, oh my god, if I believe that they can do this, that actually going to be able to take off really well. And sometimes they're really simple. So if you are heavy engineering team or doing a B2B or enterprise startup, Again, the default is you have to build it. So if you can't even build it, then it's not even gonna work. So I don't spend actually a lot of time looking at that. For me, I'm trying to figure out success will be determined by how well you can do sales, how well you can tell the story, how well you can actually convince customers and work through a sales process. I want evidence that shows that you know how to work through that and make that happen. And so all of my work with most of those companies is like, not working on a product. It's like, hey, alright, let's prove this other thing that if you have that, that'll be the thing that actually will help people go like, oh, shit. They have this super combo.

This is so much better than everything else I've ever seen. It is 10 x faster, it is 10 x cheaper, etcetera. And if it's not an order of magnitude, let's say it's just like 2 x or 3 x. Again, that's nice, but it's not enough for an investor to go like, oh, this is a slam dunk. In regards to that 10 x product and showing that you are able to have that, later in startup school, gonna do a lecture on pricing, and we'll talk things about cost and value, and that'll help you sort of better understand as like, oh, how to better prove out that 10 x multiple using sort of metric&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:27,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;27&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:230,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;230&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - Product 10x better&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Product, so this is super simple, is your product 10 x better than the competition?

And so a good examples of that are like companies with network effects and marketplaces. Where marketplaces where it tends to be a winner takes all. A 1 company will tend to win. And network effects is just basically as my network grows, the strength of my company and the value of the product or service also grows with it. Not every company has it, but when you do have that, it works out great.

And part of that has to do with, like, the press and then the exposure of the companies that make it the demo day, those are the stories you tend to hear. But that being said, there's lots of great examples of companies who actually got accepted just with an idea. And so Zenifits is a really good classic 1. Parker was a single nontechnical founder who pitched an idea to YC and he got in that way. We also had Reddit. So technically, they were forced to pivot right away. So they hadn't written a single line of code. And then my experience in in YC is actually exactly the same. So when I founded Wufu and we entered that second batch, we also had not written a single line of code. PG had invested us at just the idea stage. And so I feel fully committed now as a partner to always be trying to find and dedicate time and energy to funding companies, we're just at the idea stage. A lot of our efforts here for working on startup school is to help us help you work on how to talk and think about your startup. And that if we can fix that, it can help you sort of inspire us to be like, oh, yeah. I can believe in what you're doing.

Are you a super expert? And 99 percent of the people we fund at YC do not fall into that category. And so if you think it's like, well, I'm product manager at Google. There's a lot of product managers at Google. If you say you're an engineer at Microsoft, there's a lot of engineers at Microsoft. It's like, great, but it's not 1 that will make me think, oh, you have a greater, unfair advantage than than someone else. If you've done a PhD, and let's say you've done it on some kind of crazy biotech research, and you have like a special patent to be able to cure some kind of disease, then you have a founder advantage. Your market.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:237,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;237&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - Founder's unfair advantage&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Do you know if you have a founder, unfair advantage?

So a lot of people have the problem. You want to avoid problems that there's a small number of people that have it. We like problems that are growing. So therefore, the market, basically. Like, is it growing at a rate? That, like, more and more people are gonna be having the problem. And it's it's growing faster than other peoples or other types of problems. We like problems that are urgent, ones that need to be solved very, very quickly. We like problems that are really expensive to solve. Because if you're able to sort of solve it, then you can charge a lot of money potentially. We like problems that are mandatory. Right? So therefore, it's like, oh, people have this problem and they have to solve it. And then we like problems that are frequent, ones that people are gonna encounter over and over and over again. And often in a frequent time interval. So what you want to have is, like, some aspect of the problem that you're working on at least 1 of them, and it's ideal if you have multiple of them. You don't have to have all of them. But it's 1 of those things where it's like, if your company isn't growing, or if someone's not as excited about the problem, it's probably missing some of these characteristics. The last 1 about frequency is super important because I like problems, and you'll find a lot of other YC partners, like problems a lot that gives people a lot of opportunities to convert. Part of that has to do with some theory. So b j Fogg, he's a researcher at Stanford, and he tosses his formula up all the time. And he says, basically, if you're trying to change someone's behavior, you have 3 things you need to have in place. You need to have the motivation, the ability, and the trigger. They need to all happen at the same time. So the motivation is like, I have this problem, I need to solve, whatever it is, The ability is your startup. And then last is the trigger. What's gonna be the thing that gets them to all of a sudden realize, oh, I need to solve it with your thing. And so a lot of companies will have like, oh, I I build something, but for some reason no one's signing up or like they're not using it. They're not engaged. I have no retention. And a lot of the times is it's because it's like, you're hoping that they will somehow just remember on their own that they have the problem and to start using you. And oftentimes, most companies don't send enough, for example, email notifications. Or triggers or reminders, or figure out ways to come back into the app, or figure out ways to be back in front of the user at the right time. And if you can't figure out those opportunities, it's really hard to get people to switch over to using your solution, service, or product. So our ideal problems are millions of users. Right? Millions of people have it. Why people like to work on consumer companies. That's why some investors like to focus on them. We like markets that are growing 20 percent a year. The problem is growing quickly. We like problems where people are trying to solve it right now immediately. We like problems that just cost a ton of money, so billions of dollars. Right? Or at least they all add up to some billion dollar total addressable market. We like problems where the law has changed. The law has changed and regulation has put up there and now people have to solve a bunch of problems. You saw a ton of health care problem health care startups. We're born after Affordable Care Act was passed. And a lot of that had to do with like there was now all of a sudden opportunity. This problem that all these hospitals and clinics had to solve. And then we like problems that people need to solve multiple times a day, or we'll use it multiple times a day. Facebook's a good classic example, but people also be able to love Slack. Right? Because it's like, oh, I'm gonna be engaged and using it multiple times a day during the workday. Solution. So there there's pretty much only 1 piece of advice I really have for the solution&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:17,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;17&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:976,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;976&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - The problem&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Says, good problems, they're popular. So a lot of people have the problem. You want to avoid problems that there's a small number of people that have it. We like problems that are growing. So therefore, the market, basically...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:84,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the insight behind this startup idea and what is the reason why this solution is expected to be successful?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The last one's a little tricky. It's What is the insight? What's the reason why this solution is gonna work? And this is where a lot of companies sort of get tricked up. Because it's it's really about like, what is your company's unfair advantage? Right? Why are you gonna win versus everyone else. Why are you going to be the fastest 1 to sort of grow? Because that insight is what's needed for the investor to choose you over anyone else. And it has to be related to growth. You have to have an unfair advantage that explains why you're gonna grow quickly. If it's not related to that, then it's not it's not gonna be something that an investor is gonna find valuable. And the last 1 is you need 1. You can't just be like I have a problem. I'm solving it and I have no explanation why. Without that last sort of explanation, I can't use my imagination. I can't evaluate just solely on how well you've thought through this problem. Right? And so let's go through the types of unfair advantages that your company have. So there's 5 different types and companies do not have all of them. Really great ones surprising not surprising, we'll have all of them, and we'll go through 2 examples. But You want at least 1, and it's nice if you can have 2 or 3. But for most of you, it's probably just 1. So the first 1 so&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:23,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;23&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:349,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;349&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - The insight&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The last one's a little tricky. It's What is the insight? What's the reason why this solution is gonna work? And this is where a lot of companies sort of get tricked up. Because it's it's really about like,...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the potential growth rate of the market for startup ideas?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it growing 20 percent a year? Like, by default, if you just build a solution in the space, you should just automatically grow because you're just following a trend. If this is your only company advantage, then it's 1 of the weakest ones that you could have. It is great to be in that space but you wanna have something in addition to this. Like, you're gonna do better than average because you've picked the right problem space. And the right set of customers that want your problem. But again, if you're in a market that is stagnating or shrinking, then you're gonna have investors worried about the long term viability of your company as a result.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;14&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:159,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;159&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - Market growing 20% a year&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it growing 20 percent a year? Like, by default, if you just build a solution in the space, you should just automatically grow because you're just following a trend. If this is your only company advantage, then it's 1...&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:86,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Can you tell us about your startup and what problem it solves?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Was my startup, and it's an online form and survey builder. And so for us, it was basically every website needs to collect some kind of data some point, but you need to know how to code or hire a programmer to be able to do it. And so the solution was to build something that what they see is what they got. Like, basically, a drag and drop, visual editor, and that any nontechnical person sort of create. And then if we did that, we would solve that sort of specific problem. So very quickly, the market, it's kind of ridiculous like we were asked in the early days, calculate our TAM, but it was, like, every website needs to I don't really understand. Like, what website doesn't need to form eventually. It allowed us to grow really, really quickly. Our product was easily shown to be 10 x faster and it's against the direct competition with other builders. Because it was so much faster to do the drag and dropping and visually see. And then it was usually a hundred x faster than, like, a lot of traditional routes for very custom forms. For hiring a programmer and very cheaper because we had this freemium model. That also led to an acquisition unfair advantage. And so we actually had started off with building a blog and building an audience as well. Started off with a hundred thousand developers subscribed to our blog. We launched it out to them after building up that audience for a year, and that's actually what we applied to YC with. It's like we had built up this audience we have proved that all these other things are like in place. And then part of the other acquisition model is that you could embed these forms on people's website. And then our users basically spread our form and software for us as a result. So we never had to hire any salespeople. And the results are our product was used by every industry, market, and vertical you can imagine, tons of super large companies, and we did this with a relatively small amount of team. When we were acquired, we were a weird outlier compared to all the other acquisitions. The average company raises only raises like 25000000 dollars before an exit. And this is their average return. And for Wufu, we only raised a hundred 18000 for the whole life of the company, and our returns are over 30000 percent. Okay. So in the end, this is very simple exercise, but super enlightening when you actually go through it and to try to figure out that narrative and story. So I turn it back to you, go through, and try to answer those questions about problem solution, your unfair advantage. Figure out where are my holes? Do I have 1? And then the question becomes, oh, what do I need to prove? What do I need to work on to make that happen? Your startup idea is a hypothesis about why you're going to grow quickly. For our next lecture, we're gonna talk about the first ways we try to prove it out to basically test our hunches. And that is by talking to users.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;14&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:688,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;688&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - Example： Wufoo&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Was my startup, and it's an online form and survey builder.

And that is don't start here. So what I mean by that is why see we have an acronym for a problem that we try to avoid or basically an application that we have to go like, oh, man. I wish they had started with the problem first, and we call it SISP. And it means solution in search of a problem. And often what happens is, like, you're an engineer. You're excited about technology. Some new technology has come on the scene. Let's say it's blockchain. Right? Let's say it's like React Native or whatever the new thing is and you're like, I wanna build something with this. It's a large reason why you start working on a side project. And then you go like, okay. What kind of problem can I solve now? I'm I wanna use this no matter what, and then you try to shoe horn a problem into the solution. And what ends up happening is that's a much more difficult way to grow the company. It's not impossible for companies to grow this way. But super inefficient. It's much better to be like let me see what problems people have and then I will use whatever is necessary to solve them. And therefore, it's much more likely that you will grow as a result. Because the other way around is you might have to go and try to drum up the problem or you have to like brand the problem as something that people have. And it's so much more difficult and you end up growing much more slowly as a result. So look at what you're building right now. Look at the reason why you're trying to do this startup. And is it because you only care about the technology and building something in that? Or have you started with a problem? You go, like, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to solve people, users, customers, issues.&quot;},&quot;instruction_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;18&quot;},&quot;output_length&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:423,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;423&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to Evaluate Startup Ideas - The solution&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;That's the best advice that you can ever follow.

That's certainly not our advice, never been our advice, but, you know, we don't control the startups that run their own company. There's a broad range of what people think about this. I think some of our best companies are ones that have taken the stance that a diverse company is really important. From the earliest stages. And as other companies see Thanksgiving, for example, it's coming. It did an excellent job with that. And then many people think we'll be 1 of the most valuable companies we funded. And so as people see examples like that, I think other people are like, oh, maybe, actually, this is important and and this does work on it. I mean, there are, you know, there are the extreme cases where if you have the perfect 3 candidates in a row no matter sort of where they fit on the first specimens should probably hire them. But there's the other extreme case of where you spent no effort and you don't you don't understand the value a diversity brings. And so I think most of our startups understand the value there. Some for sure don't. And even some reason ones we funded don't, And 1 of the frustrations in the past of shareholder is that we don't get to tell people what to do. It's good and bad in that, but 1 of the bad is if someone doesn't wanna take this seriously, we can't make them. But I think by and large, the most successful companies tend to care about this pretty early on. And I think other people see that and say, okay. Maybe there's something to do this. Alright.

Well, You could you could just start, you know, a a company that won't take as long as you think. The problem is a lot of people have this idea, and markets are efficient. And so the easy companies to start are never that easy. And people that think they're going to sort of, like, build and get a 10000000 dollar exit in 12 months, generally get disappointed for a whole bunch of reasons. But that strategy never works as well as people seem to think it's going to work. I think the most certain way to become wealthy in the short term or at least wealthy enough is to go work at a company like Google or Facebook can get a crazy pay package. But what a lot of people wanna do is they actually wanna become wealthy so that they can start the hard company. And I understand that. I think that's a noble goal. But I don't think it's necessary. I think in today's funding climate, you can raise money. Even if you're a company that would've been unfashionable to fund 5 years ago. So if you only wanna become wealthy because you have this Life's work company you wanna do later. I would push on that, and I would say you don't have to. If you wanna become all because you want a bunch of sports cars, I understand that too. And then starting the hard company now doesn't help you. So I think it ends up as a as a personal decision, but it's worth it's worth really thinking about the motivations there. Now that imagine k 12 is part of YC, what role YC play in supporting imagine k 12 startups?

So the game when you're pre product market fit is how little can you spend? How much of your company can you own? To reach the product market fit. The second place where we see this screwing up time and time again is when companies make a model from how their post seed round is gonna be spent. They only model out costs, they never model out revenue. So they come back to us and they say, well, we have to raise more money because we wanna hire these 3 engineers, and we have to get this designer, we need this, and it's gonna cost all this money. And we always come back and we say, okay, well, during this entire time that you're spending this money, you know, you're spending your c run. Are you going to make any money? Are you going to generate any revenue? Have you modeled how much revenue you're gonna generate? Have you thought about whether you should continue to hire people if you're not generating any revenue? You're not turning in revenue, doesn't that mean maybe you're not building something customers want? And if that's the case, is hiring your top priority? So the best founders spend time thinking about what will happen if things go right. They ask themselves, Am I in a extremely capital intensive business or am I not? If they're a capital intensive business, they realize they probably have to take a bit of a hit of dilution. If they're not, they don't chase their peers. They don't give a shit whether their peers are raising more money or not. They compete for how much little dilution they can take pre product market fit. These founders are very formidable. It's very formidable to interact with the founder who's thinking what if things go right. And you know, let's be clear, not magical thinking, not fake steve jobs, but very much thinking, What if we can actually get these customers to pay? What if they're actually paying a market rate? What if we can reinvest that revenue into growth? The founders who think that way are extremely formidable. Counter intuitively, investors both like those founders because they're formidable and dislike those founders because oftentimes they can't get as large of an allocation in their rounds. Want to or they can't get as much ownership or there's too much competition for their rounds. As a founder, you have to understand that, like, In many situations you and your investor have different motivations, and your investor is not motivated to preserve your dilution. To have low for you to have low debt, you have to be motivated for that. Okay. Next, there's a lot of talk about mental health and work life balance in the startup world and amongst founders, I wanna be honest with you, there is no work life balance. You balance implies some level of equality. And I guarantee you and some level of stability. And I guarantee you your startup will ask more from you than you will plan. It'll be harder than you plan. It will hurt more than you plan. That doesn't sound like balance to me. As a result is extremely stressful on your mental health. And failing at something for 2 years which is extremely common in the startup world is something that is extremely uncommon in the normal world. It's something that most founders have never experienced before. And so you need to think about what your plan will be for maintaining your mental health, early. You've gotta figure out how you are going to take care of yourself because no 1 else will. It's no 1 else's responsibility to take care of your mental health. That's your game. And there's even more burden on you because not only is it your responsibility to take care of your mental health, it's your responsibility to be an example to your co founders and your employees. So If you deal with stress by drinking, drinking will become part of the culture of your company, and you will hand that down to your co founders and your employees. If you deal with stress by exercising, then health will become part of the culture of your company and you will hand that habit down to your co founders employees. So the methods you use to take care of your mental health are your responsibility and your burden because they will be greatly shared with the people around you. Take this seriously early because the startup game is extremely long and hurts. Much more than most founders realize. All right here is my last 1 and this is the second 1 that I've come up with much more lately. Disciplined beats intelligence most of the time most startups know what they have to do and the best ones actually just do it. I think there's way too much talk in Silicon Valley and the kind of Silicon Valley ecosystem that's now global about intellect, about what school you went to how smart you are, not even what school you went to like how</span></div></div>

Because if it turns out But the thing that I wanna build is what the customers want, I can always build V2 and be V3 and I can always iterate it and make it better. But if it turns out I'm working on something new customers don't want, how much time do I wanna waste building that thing before I figure it out? So this 9 10 solution can be applied to almost every technical problem that you're attacking. And I find it's an amazing conversation to have after you spec something out. After you write down this big spec with all these things. Is then you can start crossing things out and it's always motivating to a small team to be able to cross tasks out and only work on the things that are most important. Alright. Next, if you have raised money You should remember that this is not your money. You should always remember to spend your company's money with full transparency and high ethics. I've encountered this problem only a couple times after working with thousands of founders, but What is painfully obvious is that if you do something unethical with your company's money, eventually you'll be caught. Once you are caught, it will be very hard for you to ever work with ethical people in your industry ever again, so it's not worth it. It's not worth it. If you are not willing to expose your bank accounts to your cofounders, if you're not willing to walk through line by line spending with your Angel investors. You should ask yourself what are you spending money on that you shouldn't be. And you should stop. Now that doesn't mean that you should be reviewing every line of your expenses with your investors every week like let's be clear they probably don't want that, but</span></div></div>

And you cannot beat them by playing their game. Oftentimes when I talk to YC founders, I cast this in terms of the American Revolutionary War. If you're George Washington and you're trying to beat the British, you do not march your soldiers in the middle of the field against the number 1 professional army in the world at the time. You will lose you will lose. You don't take the British on head to head. You fight something that looks a lot closer to a guerrilla war. Doing things that don't scale is another way of saying do things that big companies cannot or will not do. That's where you get an advantage over these larger incumbents. So counter intuitively, when you're looking to get your first 10 customers, when you're looking to figure out exactly what they want, you should be thinking about how you can talk to them directly, how you can have a relationship with them, oftentimes you put them into a WhatsApp group together, these are things that absolutely don't scale, but it's the things that the big incumbent cannot do. Which means you're learning 10 times faster than they are, you're iterating 10 times faster than they are, you're solving your customer's problems and you're growing. So Doing things that don't scale is essential and too many founders are trying to copy the organizations and the tactics of the large companies they're competing against. You will never be a large company by trying to attack them head to head. They will always have more money and more people. So figure out how you can play your Gorilla War against the large incumbent, and usually that means doing things that doesn't scale. All right, so finding the 9010 solution. This is something that Paul Buhai to YC founder I'm sorry YC partner came up with. This has been 1 of the most viable pieces of advice that I've used personally my startup. The very simple question you should ask yourself anytime you come up with a feature idea is how do I get 90 percent of what I want with only 10 percent of the work? Unfortunately, in the startup world founders are way to protect professional, sorry, are way to looking for something perfect perfectionists. And this is what is killing their speed.

Elon Musk is a smart assert. Mark Zuckerberg is smart. I actually think this is another extremely gross mischaracterization about what's going on. Almost everyone who's watching this talk right now and who will watch in the future will have gotten almost every piece of advice I'd given. They should take a second right now to ask themselves which of these pieces of advice they're not following and why? 1 of the things that I did in the beginning of COVID was start to ask myself Why don't I have better discipline in my life? I was working extremely hard and I wasn't really enjoying my day to day life and I was asking myself why not? And I came across this idea that like I wasn't being disciplined I knew what I needed to do but I wasn't doing it. I read this book named Atomic Hobbits. And the whole thesis of this book is that you can set very, very, very small goals and you can get into the habit of accomplishing these small goals, I call that discipline and those small goals can compound like interest over time to make massive changes in your life. So 1 of the core things that was described in that book that I loved was this idea that hard tasks are hard for everyone. Everyone finds things hard. The things that are on your to do list that are giving your US stomachache, every 1 of your peers, everyone else better than you in business that are all those things, they're gonna find them hard. Effective people figure out how to get good at doing hard things. Effective people</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Look at your peer group in university or in high school, most startup founders interact with put themselves amongst the smart group of people and did something like what they did. They took the right test, they applied to the right schools, so on and so forth. In college similarly, Also in the working world, most people are trying to figure out how to get ahead. So they try to attach themselves to the peers that seem like they know what's going on. So they basically are very driven by peers. The problem with the startup world is that failure rates are way higher than in the education world or in the corporate world. It's much more likely that your peers are going to die it's much more likely that if you just do what the people around you are doing, your company is going to die. In this world where Chap Capital is a lot cheaper than it's ever been before, founders are hiring way faster and starting to blitzscale way faster than they ever did, often when they don't have product market fit. And if everyone around you is doing that, your natural instincts the instincts that serve you so well in school or so well in the corporate world will fail you here. They are literally driving their startup off a cliff are you going to follow them? So be very, very careful about scaling too early. This is 1 that is deadly time and time and time again. Okay, this is a new 1. 1 of the things that I've realized with YC founders is that while on 1 hand, they're confident they're solving an important problem and they're building something that the customers want. On the other hand, almost every decision they make is based on fear at too high of a degree. So put another way they know they're trying their startup, in their startup, they're trying to do something that's very hard to do, like 4 to 9 impossible. Yet instead of asking themselves what will happen if things go right? Do I think that this will be a good decision if my company works? They almost always ask themselves what will happen things go wrong and then plan for things going wrong. So where do we see this most specifically? Dilution. Dilution is the first place we see this most specifically. Founders should be thinking that if their company goes well, their early rounds of financing will be the most dilutive. So in that world you have to ask yourself how much money should I actually raise? Now if I think my company, you know, if I'm I'm afraid my company won't do well, I'm gonna think to myself, I should raise more money early. It's gonna give me more time to figure things out. I mean, this is to say investors will tell you that over and over and over again. It's like you can't raise a million dollar seed round, that's crazy. If you want to get a Series A to raise 2, 3000000 dollars or more. To me, that's not thinking about what would happen if things went right. To me, those arguments from investors are self serving they want to own more of your company. And therefore, they're gonna try to convince you that taking more money is better. But the best YC founders when they come back and tell us what do they wish we had told them during YC? Time and time again, they wish we had told them to raise less money. They didn't realize that their startup would work. They didn't realize their startup generating revenue. They didn't realize they could start funding their company with that revenue and they oversold their company early. Now the average founder is competing with the size of their rounds, right? They're not competing for how much revenue they're generating. The average founder dies, right? So they have to try competing around how much money they raised or kind of valuation. The smart founders compete with how little dilution they take in the early days. To accomplish the goals. Because smart founders are betting on their startups working and they realize that capital will be a lot cheaper</span></div></div>

If you are, you're doing something wrong and you need to stop. It's extremely important. No 1 in your company is going to be more ethical than you are. So as founders you set the bar here, Alright. Now in the world of massive valuations and very little progress that we're in right now, it bears repeating over and over again that a high valuation is not equal to success. What I've come to learn nowadays is that valuations are largely a function of the amount of capital in the startup ecosystem. They are not a function of how good a company is. This is 1 that I struggle with constantly because I think what founders don't understand is that they determine the validation, the worth of their company based on what an investor is willing to give them instead of determining the worth of their company based on how much customers are willing to spend using their products. I really wish that instead of companies describing themselves as a series A or a series B or a series C or a unicorn, which is letting the investor define you, which is stupid because the investor almost never uses your products, doesn't know whether it's good or not. Why not describe yourself as a company with a million in revenue, annual revenue, or 10000000 in annual revenue, or 100000000 in annual revenue, or a billion in annual revenue. When you look at the unicorns that might be intimidating you, the competitors who've raised lots of money, instead of asking yourself how much money they raised or how big of valuation they got, why not ask yourself how many dollars worth of revenue do they have? And suddenly these massive unicorns might look a lot less intimidating. 1 of the things you have to understand as a founder is that you are downstream of a massive global economy that has decided to shift where it's investing money. And that massive global economy is trying to put more money into earlier stage companies and into technology companies because, to be honest, They have finally realized that software is revolutionizing business and they look at the public markets and see that software companies are doing very well. So there's a massive global capital inflow into the venture world. Now what does that mean? Right? Well it means that if every venture capitalist from seed stage up to growth stage has more money that basically means that there is much more competition between these investors in order to invest in the best companies. It also interestingly means that it's much less likely that 2 investors or 3 investors or 4 investors want to work together and participate in rounds together especially in earlier stages because they have more money to invest. If you see a great company and you have a large fund, why wouldn't you do the whole round? Why would you share it? So as a result, this increase this increase of capital flow into venture, which is creating increased competition is, as a result, creating increased valuations. Now unfortunately non sophisticated founders look at those valuations and they think to themselves that means something, that means those companies are good. And they stop looking at what's driving the valuations. Now for some companies these valuations are absolutely credible they've accomplished great work, their revenue is growing, they've got hypertension, so on and so forth, for other companies, not so much. So this is a useful 1 for people who want to be employees and executives in addition to people who want to be founders. Take a second to look beyond the valuation and figure out what are the core metrics of that business and how are those metrics improving over time, revenue, retention, Like look at the core metrics, do not assume that valuation is a good proxy for the core metrics that make a business work. Alright. Next up. This is 1 that is always frustrating to founders. You will need to fire some of your customers. You are going to acquire some customers who are not the right fit. And that can mean a lot of different things. These can be customers who Don't have the problem you're solving. These are customers who don't have the budget to spend on solving the problem. These are customers who are trying to get you to solve a different problem, customers who don't have the authority to make a purchasing decision, customers who don't understand how important the problem that you solve is to their company. So in the process of selling software early stage, a lot of founders defaults to the idea that they should try to sell any customer they meet. This is almost the exact opposite of what you should be trying to do. The reality is you should be trying to find the perfect set of customers. And I'm deciding perfect very specifically. The set of customers who have the problem you're trying to solve and it is frustrating the shit out of them. The folks who are willing to spend money to solve the problem, the folks that can move quickly the folks who are willing to endorse your product to whoever else inside of their company needs to believe in the product in order to actually get a deal done. The folks who are willing to use early stage software, right? A lot of people are not willing to be the first or second where they want to be late. They're the IBM vibes, right? So honestly a lot of what your job is is an early stage founder doing sales, is filtering is talking to a lot of customers and trying to find the customers who are in that zone. And then building a product for them. And what founders find frustrating is oftentimes those groups have early adopts who can move quickly might not represent the entire market, but it's who you should start with. So the advice we always give to YC founders is start with the easy custom easy as I defined and be okay ignoring or saying no to the harder customers. Once you get the easy customers on board, you have learned so much more about the problem. You will have so many more useful case studies. You will be so much better talking about the product that you make, then it's going to be a lot easier to sell the harder and harder customers. Put another way, the more resources you have the harder of the customers you should be focused on. The more you can pivot from filtering to actually selling, trying to convince But in the early days, it's all about filtering. Sales is all about finding the people who don't need to be convinced. The people who are</span></div></div>

You know, and then launching to different channels will help you determine whether you're even talking to the right users. Because, you know, you might launch on 1 channel and get no response. You'll be launched on another channel, and you'll get a huge response. And so that will help you identify whether, you know, you're identifying the right user for what you're building.

But I I wanted to skim them briefly and give you an example of a company that we worked with that did it very well. As most of you know, launching to popular blogs that cover your industry or trade can be incredibly powerful. So Joy is a free wedding website builder, and they were 1 of the fastest growing companies in their batch. And a lot of their early growth like an alarming amount of their really early growth was due to being placed on a number of lists like this. They essentially googled. They looked at, you know, SEO, and they googled, you know, best wedding website builders and figured out who was coming up on, you know, first couple pages of results on Google, and they reached out to all those bloggers. And, you know, they said, hey, we have this new product, you know, we think community. Would love it? Would you be willing to add us to this list? And they, you know, they said that they reached out and basically did a drip campaign to over 50 of 50 bloggers and only got responses from 4, but those 4 responses made a huge impact for their early growth. So 1 note that I want you to keep in mind is that some blogger and influencer opportunities are pay to play. And Joy did not pay early on, and I do not want you paying early on either. If folks are asking you to pay, please find other or creative roots to get around this because as startups, as early stage startups, you just don't have, you don't have the money to do it. And so I'm it is definitely possible to go this route without paying a ton of money. So figure out, you know, wait routes around the expensive sort of sponsorship dollars. If you're a hardware or physical product, of course, you can do a pre order campaign. So, you know, at pairing for the order launch could honestly be a whole presentation of its own. But take a look at some successful campaigns and get a sense for how they built out their launch strategy. So for example, SheerText was a company NYC that was making unbreakable sheer pantyhose, the founder Catherine made a great, really compelling video She pitched press. She launched on Hacker News, where, you know, Hacker News is probably, you know, it's a very male audience. So, we were curious how how they would respond to something like sheer, you know, unbreakable pantyhose, but they loved it. They thought it was very clever. They thought, you know, they the technical piece behind it was really interesting. And, you know, so so I would recommend, like, any company, you know, try to launch and and see how different communities respond. She launched a product hunt she asked her friends and family and batchmates to and investors to help spread the word. And</span></div></div>

So every time they launch a product so for example, when they launched Stripe Atlas, they launched it on hacker news, and the founders were in the thread talking to all, you know, potential users and and talking about the product and why they were launching it. The problems that they felt it was solving, they blogged about it, They spread the word on social media. They pitched press. And this is something that they do over and over again. If you look at Stripe's blog, if you look at Hacker News, you can kind of see the history since the beginning. They've been very great at sort of activating the community. Glossier, which is a, you know, a beauty brand, is incredible at launching new product. And the way they think about it is actually very scientific. They release products on a very specific cadence at specific intervals, And for every product, they essentially hit every single launch button again and again. So community, social media, press advertising, So each time this they, you know, these new product launches, which is basically, like, every 6 to 8 weeks, they have this cycle going.

Talk like a human when you're addressing the community. So all you need in these, you know, when you introduce yourself in these posts, introduce yourself, talk about what you're building, talk briefly about why you're doing it or how you came across the problem. People on Hacker News, for example, are super intellectually curious. So are there any interesting insights that you've learned from talking to potential users or your users? Is there anything surprising or delight full that you could share with the community because people love that. And they also wanna ask you questions, but sometimes don't know exactly how or which questions they should ask you. So tee it up for them, say, hey, I'm an expert in x y and z, and I'm happy to answer questions on these topics. Otherwise, you risk people going down all sorts of weird rabbit holes.

So when Magic launched, you know, overnight, they got 40000 people signing up. And, of course, they couldn't serve 40000 users immediately. So they launched a waitlist. And they also gave people ways to skip the line. So, for example, if you tweeted about magic, you'd get, you know, to skip a few spots in line. So you can build these viral elements into your launches that will help get people to spread the word for you. 1 of my current favorite examples of this request for access launch is superhuman. So superhuman is building a better email experience. So you can go to their site here and request access. And you can also ask a current user to refer you, and then that'll help you skip the line. So in the signature of all emails that are sent by superhuman users is a little tag that says sent by superhuman. And so I'm a superhuman user, and I get a ton of emails. Like, I'll send a ton out of of my emails out to people and I get a ton of emails asking me for referrals. So, you know, people I email say, hey. How did you like superhuman?

And now they are stressing over every line on their landing page, and, you know, they're trying to line up everything right with timing, But if you're like most startups, you will launch something, and no 1 will care. And if it took you 6 months to get there, you your start is probably gonna be before you get another chance to launch. So in the same sort of spirit, I'd always be shipping. I want you to think about launching as than you can continually do. I wanna destroy the idea that launching is just this 1 moment in time because assuming you do well, and assuming you ship new products and new features, you are never going to be not launching.

And you this you can do this even really pre product. So there was 1 Yc founder, Daddy Avron, who was founder Sometria, and he had a really particularly successful TechCrunch launch. A TechCrunch launch is, you know, a story about what they were doing launched in TechCrunch. And I noticed that they had a ton of shares, a ton of engagement, So I asked him to share, you know, how did you set this up? What did you do to share and spread the word about your launch? And he said that over the years, you know, even before launching the product, he started to build his own email list. So every person he met that he discussed his startup with, even, you know, even very loosely. He would add them to an email list, and they would get, you know, sort of email updates about what he was working on on a semi regular, like, at semi regular intervals. So when the TechCrunch article came out, he said he sent that email to the list full of all the people that he'd, you know, he'd ever talk to other startup founders, investors, friends, family, and asked for their help in spreading the news. And he said the response was significant. And he's even saw VCs who hadn't invested in them sharing the story from their own personal Twitter accounts. And he said, you know, you would be really apprised by who comes out of the woodwork to help when you ask for it. So, I would recommend while you're in startup school, you have the opportunity to talk to so many people about what you're building and start and ask them, hey, can I add you to my update list? And over time, you know, that you'll get that into the hundreds, maybe maybe even thousands. So I would definitely recommend that you start doing that now. And so to sum up, I want you to stop thinking about launching as this 1 moment in time. I don't want you to spend all of startup school getting ready for this 1 big day, this 1 big launch day that you're trying to line up all these things for. This is something that is a continuous process that you can do over the course of the next couple months and into the life cycle of your company. If you didn't catch them the first time, these are all the opportunities that we went over. And I'm Kat. So if you ever have any questions, it's Demodays coming up, so I might be slightly slower than usual to respond, but you can always reach out to cat at y Combinator, and I'm also on Twitter.

So for example, this is a random startup school company that I found from a founder who'd posted on the forum. Their company is Zinc. They have, you know, a domain name. They have their company name.

Product hunt, for example, has an actual product for pre launch companies called Ship. And it's a way to collect potential, like, interest from potential users. So for example, this is something called designer school. And it has a quick intro from the founders, a short description of what the company does, and a call to action, which is subscribe.

So 1 of my favorite examples of a YC company launching launching to strangers is the company Lugg. So Lug is an app that lets you call movers and delivery people on demand. So even before Lug had built a fully functioning app or product, they would rent a truck and they would go drive to IKEA, and they would sit outside of IKEA. So they would watch shoppers and they'd look people who were having a particularly difficult time tying stuff to the top of their cars. And they'd run up to those customers, and they'd say, like, hey, Instead of trying to tie this mattress on top of your car, wouldn't it be cool if you could just push a button and someone with a truck would come and help do this for you? And the customers would be like sweating, and they'd be like, yes. That's that's exactly what I need at this moment. And, you know, they'd hit they'd download the app they'd click the lug button, and then the founder would run back to the parking lot, drive up in his truck, and then the the customer would be like, oh my god. It's you. And and they were like, you know. So it was a real hustle at the beginning. Like, none of this was working on the back end, but it really confirmed for them that this a hair on fire problem for their users and customers. And so they decided it makes sense for us to really build this out and spend time, you know, on this product. So launching to strangers will help do that for you. It will help show you whether people are actually willing to download and pay for what it is you're building.</span></div></div>

So in its earliest days, Reddit was shared just among the founders of their Bat y You know, there were only 8 companies. It was a really small community. I used the way back machine to actually see what Reddit looked like in its earliest days. It hasn't changed that much. But if you look closely, this is actually before they called up votes, up votes. They were calling it boosts. This is, like, 2005 in July. So that's how they got their very first users, just sharing it among their community of founders. And so, you know, What I recommend you do is share the product with your friends and family, watch them use it, you know, sit down next to them and ask for feedback. But don't stay in this phase for too long because your friends and family might not be the exact right, you know, ideal user for your product or what you're building. And so sometimes their feedback isn't quite as helpful as a real user's is. So for example, you know, if Alexis and Steve had shared this with their parents, their parents might have been like, what the hell is this? So you get, you know, get out of that know, family and friends circuit as fast as you can.</span></div></div>

This is actually 1 of my favorite ways to launch. I think you should plan a launch for every single community that you are part of. So when a company goes through Y Combinator, they have the option of launching on BookBase before they launch publicly. So Bookface is our internal platform at YC. It's like Facebook meets LinkedIn, meets Quora, and there are currently over 4000, you know, other founders on Bookbase. So it's a fairly low risk way to launch, because it's it's not totally public, but there is enough of an audience there to get some feedback And you're launching in front of, you know, fairly friendly people who, you know, wanna see you succeed. And so they they launch there. And what I think you guys are particularly lucky, because you have startup school, and you have the startup school forum, which about 40000 founders are on. So if you have an early version of your product, there is literally no reason that you shouldn't be launching to the startup school community in the next few weeks. And so, you know, I also think that founders and other people making and building stuff, they give the best early product feedback. So you have thousands of other founders at your disposal. So I think that, you know, that this kind of gives you a leg up here. Here's a sort of extreme example of a company that successfully launched in online communities. So magic is an on demand personal assistant. When they started in Y Combinator in 20 15, they were actually building a blood pressure monitoring app. They were trying to get this blood pressure monitoring app to grow, and it wasn't growing as quickly as they were hoping. So they decided, you know, let's test out another idea. That we had. So they sent a link around for their friends and family, and it just looked like this. It basically said, like, Texas phone number, and we'll make anything happen like magic. Like, it was very, very basic. And their friend 1 of their friends thought it was so cool that they shared it on Reddit and Hacker News. And basically overnight, like, over the course of a weekend, 40000 people signed up to use magic. And so, of course, they were like, oh my god, this is crazy. And and let's let's be honest. This is an extreme case, and almost no 1 who launches on Reddit and Hacker News is going to get 40000 users overnight. But my point is it's definitely worth putting yourself out there because, you know, you might be 1 of those, like, extreme cases, but at the very least, you'll get some early users, and you'll get some great feedback. So many of the startups that go through YC launch on Hacker News and Product Hunt. And, you know, we over time have looked at the stats of how well these launches convert. So a tech crunch launch versus a product hunt launch versus a hacker news launch. And in terms of converting to users, you know, they're starting to even out in terms of their impact and and conversion for, you know, whether it's, you know, your sign ups or, you know, converting to customers. So if you're launching in these communities and aren't active members of these communities yet, I my suggestion is that you spend a little bit of time looking at the communities. You understand the rules, especially if you're if you're posting to subreddits. Right? They all sort of have their own moderators have their own rules, understand the best way to talk to to these communities. And if it's a community that's known for being helpful, ask for advice, ask for feedback. If you're not part of these communities, I'd reach out to someone who is and ask them for advice. Ask them for the best way to launch because there are going to be tips for every community. And, you know, for example, 1 company in this batch you know, was building something that he wanted to get more, you know, women's perspectives on, and and there are, you know, 2 male founders. And 1 of the users of Alpha, which is a community for women in tech, said, hey, I'll post that to Alpha for you, and I'll tell you what kind of feedback they got. So I recommend like connecting with someone in the community and asking them for help if you're not part of</span></div></div>

You can also ask follow-up questions and please learn how to make use of these ones. It's very hard to get someone to say everything and just 1 answer to 1 question. Get comfortable with asking questions like, what do you mean by that? Or can you tell me more about that? Or why is that important to you? Here are some questions that you should not ask. There are ways you can kind of derail this interview. Will you use our product? They're probably gonna say yes. But they're not gonna mean anything to you in that answer. 2, which features would make product x better? Remember, their job is to tell you about the problem, your job is to think about what features to solve that problem. So ask asking them about your job isn't really gonna Yes and no questions. It's not really that helpful for you. You want them to explain and give you as many concrete and real examples possible. Just simply asking yes on the questions is not ideal here. And 4, how would would a better product x look like? You? How would a better carbon emission accounting software would it take to you? Many of the people aren't product developers. They're not software engineers. They're not designers. They're not product managers. This is not their job. Their job is to do a different job. You are the 1 trying to understand what is the challenging part about their job? And finally, asking 2 questions at the same time. This is going to confuse them and it's going to confuse your answers. So this is when you're eager to get get answer is very easy to do this this thing but try to avoid it. But I want to highlight 1 of the things I mentioned here. There's 1 big danger to me to view that is to focus on features instead of problems. It's very natural for you to do that. Your your brain is thinking through all the ways you're gonna solve this problem. But really what you hear for here in this interview is to deeply understand the problems not actually come up with solutions. That's for for for a separate event. So users generally have good problems but also generally bad solutions. So I'll give you 2 specific examples. So early days of Gmail, users were asking Paul Buchat, the founder of Gmail, to view both the inbox and the actual email that they were reading on the same screen. Now why would they ask for that? Well, the reason was simply that Gmail is too slow and people did not wanna wait to load each of the emails in the inbox. I want to see everything at the same time. Similarly, in early Airbnb, a lot of guests wanted to have the phone numbers of the host so they can call them. And we're like, why do you need that? It just turned out that they didn't fully trust the platform. Like, we had not displayed enough trust in Airbnb so they needed to feel comfortable with getting to know the host before actually making the booking. Secondly, users don't have incentive to say no to really any additional features. If you ask for this feature or this feature or this feature, they'll probably say yes to everything. Right? You, however, are in charge of the organizations and you have a lot more incentives than they have to figure out which are the most important of the features. So let's talk about next steps. So you've done your 5 or 10 of these user interviews. You've written down your notes. Let's let's talk about what you do then. 1, you wanna make sure you have notes from all each of the interviews. You can use sticky notes or some similar software to organize these learnings can bucket them in different buckets that kind of describes different problems and and see which 1 is actually the thing that matters the most. And then you wanna write down your conclusions, what are you learning from all of this? You want to use all of this information to create a hypothesis or what the solution to this problem might be. Don't over intellectualize this process. Really, you just want to start signing MVP as fast as you can, but you want to make sure you have accurate information when you decide the MVP. And then you want to test it with the same users. It's also important to know if the problem you solve is actually valuable. What I mean by this is that people will value the solution to the problem enough to pay for or the problem itself solving the problem is valuable. So here are some good tips to determine if it is. 1, are people paying money for other solutions in this face today are the people that make the PDF reports for carbon emissions accounting, are they getting paid? Well, if they are getting paid, that's a good sign. That this is probably a valuable thing. Do people already have solutions to this problem they are very happy with? Even though it might appear basic to you, for example, like Excel or Google spreadsheets, is actually competitors to many, many, many, many hundreds of startups. Actually quite a formidable 1. To move someone off excel or Google spreadsheet, you need to make the experience of your solution dramatically better. They're not going to pay you hundreds of dollars a month for something they can almost as easily do in Google spreadsheet or Excel. And 3, you want to evaluate how easy it is to sell to this audience. And this is 1 thing that I like to do a lot with the companies I work with. For example, selling to plumbers or contractors is notoriously difficult compared to selling to startups. The first 2 groups just don't change their tools or the software very often versus start ups are open to trying new things all the time. So If you are solving a problem as valuable, you still have to think about whether it's gonna be easy to solve this particular audience. 1</span></div></div>

Even if it's just a design prototype in an invision or something like that, you can just click through We used to do this therapy all the time. We go downstairs in our in our office. We would find some people that were waiting for an interview or waiting for getting a coffee or something. And we just show them the latest version of of the app. This would be an in vision prototype on our phone, ruby's Play. Hand them our phone and and and show it to them. This is stuff that we haven't even dealt yet. The key thing, but if you're doing this tactic is to not tell them what to do. Not tell them what to do. Just watch them play around with it. You can tell them a specific goal like try to make a booking at Airbnb or try to do a search with dates on Airbnb or something like that. But do not tell them exactly how to solve each screen. Remember, if this was a real product, you wouldn't be standing the next to them to give them advice. Another good trick, when you're doing this, either when you're listening or having them or or recording them is to have them speak their mind while they're doing it, have them describe exactly what they're thinking on each of the steps. Maybe the words that they're reading, maybe that will give you hints of what words do they understand and which words do they don't understand or maybe what specific screen means or what purposes. And after you've done a bunch of these interviews and then maybe MVP sessions, it's a great idea to keep these these interviewees involved throughout the process. 1 common idea that a lot of licensing companies are using is to create a Slack instance or a WhatsApp group with their customers. Now, you want to make them feel special, right? You want to make them feel like they have exclusive active access to the future world changing product. So Think about how you are wording or or or how you communicate this WhatsApp group that you add in them to. It's a great idea to keep showing them your product up as they are progressing. Then kind of give them this exclusive feeling that I'm the first 1 to see this product product as it's progressing. And also, as you are reacting to things that they're saying, you can ship a new a new screen with a new version of the product. And that builds trust with with them, they now know that you react to their feedback very fast. Finally, some of them will love connecting with other people doing the same thing as they are. They don't get to do this very often and you are the 1 enabling that. If you do all these steps you will collect the right information from your future users, you will keep them involved and translate the information, and that allow you to translate the information into a first prototype and MVP.

They think ideas of new products is something the financials come up with on a lacy Sunday or a late night coding session. You'd probably know, it doesn't work this way. This scene, as you can see here here, is a scene from the social network movie. It's a great movie, but they got a lot of things wrong on how Facebook actually got started. This is Brian Chesky. Brian is the co founder and CEO of of Airbnb. On the left side of the photo is Amal. Amal was the very first guest on Airbnb. They actually spent a weekend together in San Francisco when they would be kind of watched. You notice the difference between this photo and the previous photo Well, this photo actually is a real photo, it includes a 2 way conversation with a real customer. Great founders talk to future customers before they even have a product. In fact, the very best founders in the world learned directly from their users throughout the life of their company. But that's in again. If you have correctly identified who the users are, you should learn from them throughout the lifetime of your company. Why? You might ask. Users and customers will keep you honest. They are the only stakeholders actually paying you anything. If anyone will tell you the truth, it will be them. So my talk today is about how to do this well. So let's talk about another Airbnb story. In 20 10 and I remember this myself, Brian Chesky the CEO of Airbnb. He'll decide to launch an experiment. He was going to give up his apartment and live in 50 different Airbnb over the next couple You might ask yourself, why would anyone do that? So much hassle. Most people who read the articles about this experiment because he did announce it, they missed a point. I personally remember this being kind of crazy. By doing this, Brian will literally get a chance to talk to every 1 of these 50 hosts each single day on his trip, and 1 incredible source of honest feedback on your product. Without the Airbnb hosts, MB would not exist today. What Brian Joe and Nate did so early is deeply understand the motivations and the feedback from their hosts. Still today, Brian and Joe gets calls from hosts on their personal cell phone numbers. I remember them telling me that on their first day I worked at Airbnb. Why do they do that? Well, it's the number that they put on the website and share with all of their hosts early on. There weren't hiding behind anonymous email that wanted to hear from the customers. At the time, this seemed almost radical, most founders would spend their time in front of the computers trying to find scalable growth channels like Google Ads. Unfortunately, most founders still don't build personal connections with their users today. Behind behind info at emails or don't do not reply emails. You don't believe me? You should just do a search in your email for do not reply at and see how many people don't want to talk</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Customers. So let's start by trying to figure out who I should talk to. It's always easy to interview people that you know or people who are on your network They're simply the most likely to respond but perhaps can be less honest in their answers to not offend you. Don't be afraid of reaching out to them and don't be afraid of rejection. The second group here is coworkers or former coworkers. They can be a really great source. They might know the topic really well, and if you're building software for startups, you can easily let and easily navigate yourself to someone who's a potential user. It's also very common that the early users you speak to are outside of your personal circles or your coworker circles. When asking Wisei founders how they found their early users, some of the most common answers were LinkedIn, Red forums, Slack, or Discord communities, and sometimes in person events. So to illustrate this process a little better, I'm going to start a new mock startup. This is not a real company, I'm just making it up. But I'm going to go through the process as I would have if this was a real company. And first, I want to understand if the problem is real. My hypothesis that I have here or kind of like the idea space that we sometimes call NYC, is that companies want to reduce their carbon emissions but for whatever reasons don't do that. So my plan is very simple. I want to first interview some potential customers 2, learn about the problems and motivations around carbon emissions. And 3, try to understand what an MVP will look like. MVP is a mineral viable product. To do this research, I plan to start by reaching out to founders, CEOs, CFOs, at startups, or or bigger companies. I'm also going to reach out to people on LinkedIn to have titles like carbon or climate or sustainability, basically, worse that gives me a hint that there might be relevant people to talk to. So what am I looking to learn? Well, first, I'm trying to understand, do the company that they work for care about the carbon emissions. And 2, why do they care and why do they not care if they don't care? And 3, Who in that company might be the 1 who cares the most about this and why. Alright. So so here are 2 examples of outreach messages. So the first 1 is a LinkedIn message to a CFO who I used to work with at Airbnb, the message will go something like this. First, I introduce myself I mentioned something about our time it ever be. Then I say, I'm starting a new project, briefly describe it but not too much in detail, and I just ask for a 20 minute phone call or a video call. That's it. And here's another example of a message to someone I don't know. It's also on LinkedIn to the same group that I mentioned earlier. It's similar, but geared towards people I don't know. So the message will and the tone will be a little</span></div></div>

Because who will some say, well, Like like this is something that I want to occur instead of so there's something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe somebody else can come up with a better approach or or better outcome is that we achieved democratization of AI technology, meaning that no 1 company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, you know, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation. I think if you've got any any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's who's gonna control that. So it's not as I think that the risk is that the AI would develop the role of its own right off the bat. I think it's more that's the consumers that some someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or or and even if they weren't gonna use it in a way that's bad, but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad. That that I think is quite a big danger. I think we must have democratization of AI technology and make it widely available. And that's, you know, the reason that, obviously, Umi and the rest of the team you know, created Open AI was to help with the demographers help help spread out AI technology. So it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. And and but then that course, that needs to be combined with solving the high bandwidth interface to the cortex. Humans are so slow.</span></div></div>

And then when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing. My grad studies on is was was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And then I put that on hold to start an Internet company in in 95 because there there there does seem to be like a time for particular technologies when they're at a a steep point in the inflection code. And and I didn't wanna, you know, do a PhD at Stanford, and then and what should all happen And then and and I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would actually succeed.

But, you know, we we already have a a situation in our brain where we've got the cortex and limbic system And the limbic system is is kind of the I mean, that's that's the primitive brain. It's kind of like the your your instincts and whatnot. And then the cortex is the thinking of a part of the brain. Those 2 seem to work together quite well. Occasionally your cortex and limbic system may disagree, but they It generally works pretty well. Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who I I've not found someone who wishes to either get rid of their cortex or get rid of their limbic system. Very true. Yeah. It's that's unusual. So so I think if if we can effectively merge with AI by improving that that the the the neural link be between your cortex and the the the digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then then effectively, you become an an AI human symbiote And and if that then is widespread with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well. We don't have to worry about some sort of evil dictator AI because kind of we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of?

So now that we've talked about how to define primary and secondary KPIs, how do we set targets? Assuming growth is your primary KPI, How much growth is enough? This depends on your business and your stage. But in Paulgram's classic essay about growth, He notes that for a company going through YC, 5 to 7 percent week over week is growth is good and a 10 percent week over week growth is exceptional. As I've said a few times now, small changes in weekly or monthly growth growth rate Really compound and make a difference in the long run. So early growth is better than late growth if you can choose. That number on your bathroom mirror per Airbnb story reminds you to focus on this early. Here are a few factors that might impact your growth rate that you might wanna keep in mind. First, latent demand might boost early growth. Perhaps some early users will be willing to put up with an inferior product experience because you're solving an urgent need. But that growth rate might be tougher to sustain later. For enterprise businesses, the length of your sales cycle might be This should go up down over time, but it might impact early KPI in goal setting. In these cases, you can set goals around other process metrics for example, leads in different stages of your funnel. Another thing that might be impacting your growth rate is whether you're doing organic or paid user acquisition. Early on, organic is ideal. You should know where to find your first few passionate users and talk to them directly and ideally have them spread the word. You can also run paid acquisition tests so that once you have a product that's growing organically, and a sense for payback period, you can crank out the ads crank up the ad spend to drive growth. But please, don't do this too early and don't leak money on this stress. Actually accidentally. The last thing I want to talk about on this slide is retention and engagement. We get a common question. Should we focus on getting new users? Or focus on retaining our existing users. The short answer to this is you have to do both. The slightly longer nuanced answer is that both will impact your revenue growth. So get a sense for which one's gonna have more impact. First, make sure you don't have a problem with churn and that your user are sticking around long enough to pay back their acquisition cost, and to tell their friends, you don't wanna bring new customers into a substandard product. But beyond that, of course, focus on bringing in new users. Ultimately, both these metrics will need to be strong to sustain a healthy revenue growth. To share another example from Super Daily, early on, they realized that the acquisition numbers were tracking were not reflecting a healthy growing business and could be artificially boosted due to paid promos. To protect against this, they switched their track metric from sign ups, which was too easy to gain, to tracking customers who'd who'd placed 5 or more orders since they saw this as a leading indicator to customers that were very likely to become long term revenue generating customers. This helped the super daily teams align their marketing and their overall revenue goals to chase top line revenue</span></div></div>

Next, you want to rank by probability of success, and then subrank with respect to complexity or how long it's gonna take you to do this task. Pick only a couple of things to try. Once you pick a few tasks and start working on them, If your KPI isn't moving, be really honest about why. Ask why several times until you feel like you can actually understand the real reason. Even if it's hard to hear. For the example of super daily earlier, it might be something simple like the milk brand. Do retros in your weekly initiatives. Are you predicting impact and complexity well? Did you complete all the tasks you were expecting to complete in this sprint? If not, next time, break them down more. Give yourself time blocks to reduce context switching, or maybe did you accidentally work on some of those fake progress tasks we talked about? Just do better next time. And then move fast, learn, and then do something differently the next time if what you did didn't work. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Don't let indecision slow you down, just pick a path and keep moving. Ideally, you're gonna be growing fast. If not, talk to a lot of users fast, churn through your bad ideas fast, so that you can get to working on the right good ideas as fast as possible.

When setting targets, there are 2 possible approaches, and you can and actually should do both. Your first option is a top down approach. Set a goal or a milestone that you need to reach sometime in the future. For example, 5000 dollars in MRR by the end of startup school. Back into that weekly growth rate that you need to achieve to achieve that longer term goal. The Airbnb demo day example is a great example of this. Set a target and obsess over it. Compounding matters, so getting an early start helps a lot. Your second option is a bottoms up approach. Ask yourself, what do you think is realistic for you to get done in the next week? Then you can project out from there. As a thought exercise, when doing a bottoms up goal setting, you can ask yourself, what could we achieve with unlimited funding? A lot of people in their heads think that funding is a bottleneck, so let's remove that. What could we do in the next week with unlimited money or resources? Then ask yourself, What creative ways can we still achieve that even with limited funding? Set your goal. Between top down and bottom up, Either's actually fine. I recommend periodically doing both to see whether what you're doing is realistic, achievable, and ambitious at the same time. Just make sure that you're checking to make sure that you're always on track to build a big business and aren't accidentally ending up in that no man's land of underwhelming but consistent growth. Let's talk a little bit more about some non revenue KPIs that may be tempting, but not always right. First, CAC to LTV ratio. You might hear these buzz words together. These are generally concerns kind of later in your business, but they usually come post product market fit once you have a fundamental business that you know people want, and then you need to reliably scale your user base. So for now, we recommend you only worry about payback period. Ideally, your payback period is 0, as in 0 dollars spent on CAC, so customers are profitable on day 1. If you do need to spend on CAC or unpaid acquisition, get a sense for how quickly users pay back that CAC and whether you're reliably hitting it. Does your retention rate make this work? LTV can really be a rabbit hole for early stage companies and it's really hard calculate, so just make sure your payback period is reasonable, and you're making money per user. A second tempting KPI I wanna talk about is free sign up or daily active users. I'll start by saying this, paying customers will have very different expectations for a product than for than free customers will. So if you plan to charge for your product eventually, don't mess around getting feedback from free customers. It'll likely be the wrong feedback. Get paid from day 1 or at least don't count those users as part of your growth. The main exception here is from marketplaces are products that have a strong network effect and need volume in order to have utility. Uber is a great example of this. Without enough drivers on the platform, the user experience was not good enough for riders to pay a premium for. In these cases, sign ups or GMV can sometimes suffice if no rent revenue is being generated yet. I have a couple of stories of start up spending too much time on sign ups and shifting to revenue too late in the game. Scribbed was an early YC company that went through in summer 2006. They spent their first 4 years primarily growing a free product, and they were afraid of losing their millions of customers if they started charging. As you can see in this graph in year 5, so remember, they started in 2000 in mid 2010, they started charging. And while they did lose over 90 percent of their customers, Their revenue grew by infinity percent. They finally had a business. And while scribd already had millions of users, it wasn't until they started charging. That they started to really learn what their paying users wanted.</span></div></div>

We're gonna talk more about how to set KPIs in the next section, but I wanna talk about why this is critical for prioritization. So first, you need to identify your top KPIs. If you've launched, your primary KPI should be revenue growth. If you don't wanna make revenue growth, your primary KPI, you need to really push yourself on why. We talk more about this later in this talk, but this is important enough to mention here. A non revenue KPI is rarely the right 1, and we'll talk about a few exceptions later. If your prelaunch, your KPI is in the short term, might be weeks until launch, or number of conversations with users. But once you do launch, please quickly shift shift your KPIs to revenue growth. Second, you need to decide, what's your KPI goal for this week? We'll talk about goal setting later, but assume that you have some goal for example, 10 more paying customers by next week. Make sure this ladders up to any longer term goals that you have. The reason setting the right KPI goals is critical, is that it'll remind you of the urgency of growing fast. Early growth compounds, and tracking goals weekly reminds you of this. Here at YC, we talk a lot about the early days of Airbnb, where the founding team rode their weekly KPI goals on their bathroom mirror, so they were facing that reality multiple times a day. In addition to identifying the right KPIs, you also need to identify your biggest bottleneck or problem in moving your top KPI. Here's an example from a YC company called Super Daily, a daily grocery subscription service in India that sold to Swiggy in 20 18. Super Daily faced a scenario early on when they launched v 1 of their product. There were a ton of things to be optimized. You guys picture this business. It's operationally complex. With the mobile app, ops tooling, inventory management, and a whole lot of messi on the ground logistics. But their north star was growth. And they were able to see clearly that their bottleneck was the conversion of users who actually got pretty far down the sign up flow and then churned. So they asked themselves, why are high intent users not converting? That was the biggest problem they needed to solve, and the first tasks they prioritized were conversations and experiments to understand this. By focusing on this question, they realized that high intent users were dropping out because a lot of users wanted a specific milk brand that Super Daily didn't carry. It wasn't a UX friction issue or an app issue. So they onboarded that milk brand rather than beautifying their sign up screen. Once they solved this, then they started looking at how to convert users that were maybe farther up the funnel or lower intent, you that were referred by word-of-mouth or people that were casually checking out super daily. So by the time those users got farther down the funnel to the highest intent phase, they now had that top milk brand on the app and they knew that they weren't optimizing a funnel that would leak farther down. By onboarding this new brand, Super Daily was able to increase their conversion rate by 50 percent</span></div></div>

So as a sanity check, here are some things that should and should not end up on your list in most cases. Since we're talking about the 90 percent case here, and specifically talking about early stage startups. Here are a list of example tasks that you should see on your task list. Talking to users, then building and iterating based on user feedback. When you're spending time talking to your customers and responding to support emails, There is a direct path to revenue growth. The only way you know what your customers want is by talking to them all the time. And the only way to grow is by building something people want. Not much else is gonna help you at this stage. Here are some things that should not end up on your task list. Hey, hey, fake progress. Passive fundraising conversations or coffees when you aren't actively raising. When you do decide to raise, it should be deliberate, focused, and time boxed. Conference attendances, other than a few select industries, this generally won't move your needle at an early stage. Third, arbitrary technical milestones. Spending time optimizing technical benchmarks, launching an Android app, Unless you're hearing clearly from your users that this is a burning pain point, this is probably fake progress at this point. You guys, this fake progress list it's not anything to be ashamed about. Smart people put these things on their list all the time. We've all done it. These are all tasks that can make you feel good. They boost your ego, they're metrics that you can brag about on LinkedIn, they might make your mom proud, they might make your ex boyfriend jealous, But what they don't do is they don't necessarily get you closer to product market fit. Here are some common tricks your brain plays on you when you're trying to prioritize. These are tricks and traps that your mind has to help you avoid negative feelings like shame, despair, embarrassment, self doubt, many people are drawn to low leverage tasks. Why? They provide a sense of accomplishment. They allow you to check things off your list and it's so tangible. At a time when your startup's future is uncertain, there can be so much satisfaction in checking tasks off a list. Don't fall into this trap. Here are some examples of this. Spending too much time optimizing paperwork or on licensing, incorporation, equity, this is not an area where you need to optimize or innovate. Just follow the standard advice to stay legal and compliant. Slightly cheaper workers' comp insurance or a slightly better equity structure is not gonna make or break your business. Taking meetings with potential investors, advisors, partners, or building cool hard features that you don't know people want yet, Again, these things can make you feel really good and really smart. Solving hard problems is awesome. Unfortunately, it's not gonna help you find product market fit sooner. It's just gonna be things you're checking off a list. The second mental trap I wanna talk about is that sometimes you can fool yourself into thinking something is working when it's really not. Be honest with yourself. It doesn't feel good to admit to yourself, or your teammates, or your investors, or your mom, that things aren't going well. But you're not doing yourself any favors by not diagnosing problems early and often. Slow growth can be deceptive. It's easy to mistake slow growth for product market fit. As someone that's worked at both kind of slow steady growth companies, my own startups, and companies with clear product market fit, like DoorDash, trust me, you guys, these types of growth feel fundamentally different. Third trap I wanna talk about is perfectionism, or indecision blocking progress. When nothing seems to be working, it's really easy to make every decision feel like it's gonna make or break your company. In reality, Most decisions don't matter, and for the ones that do, it's okay to decide wrong first and then fix it later. Just keep moving. So the best case scenario, you know, the 1 you can put in a pedestal is a scenario where you make the right decision quickly every time. This is completely impossible. No one's gonna achieve this. I recommend the second best option, which is to make pretty good decisions quickly. And then if they turn out to be wrong, fail, learn and switch to what's working quickly. As a startup founder, you have dozens of decisions to make every day. Don't waste time on the ones that won't help you get to product market fit. Remember, if it's a tough call, it actually probably means you can't go wrong. So pick 1, keep moving. The fourth mental trap I wanna talk about is spending too much time on downside instead of chasing upside. Downside protection is straightforward and satisfying, fixing little problems is very easy. But rarely where the innovation happens. Chasing upside requires risk taking, creativity, a lot of false starts, So get in as many iterations as you can. For example, we hear a lot of ops teams talking about getting themselves out of spreadsheets. Y'all at this stage, spreadsheets are fine until they're not. If they're working, stick with them. It's good to do things that don't scale as long as they're not breaking. Instead, spend your time finding out what your users need in order to use your product every day instead of once a week. That's the upside chasing that we're talking about. The last trap I wanna call out today is chipping away at small problems when there's a big existential 1 looming that maybe you don't wanna face. For example, you may tell yourself, hey, my 150 users are asking for 1 click ordering. Let me go build it. You guys you only have a hundred and 50 users. This is a problem. Maybe you've only had a hundred and 50 users for the past 3 months and they're starting to churn and no 1 knew is signing up. That's your biggest problem. Go solve that. So here's a quick recap on prioritization. You'll never get to everything on your task list, You have to use KPIs to prioritize your work and only work on the biggest blocker to your primary KPI, and be honest with yourself, and</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Fail fast. So now let's talk about how to choose the right KPIs. Remember, we can't afford to waste time running fast in the wrong direction. Let's define primary and secondary KPIs. Your primary KPI or primary metric is the main metric you use to measure whether your business is on track. For the vast majority of startups, your primary KPI should be growth and ideally revenue growth. This indicates that you've built something people want, and you're on track to building a huge business. As we've mentioned, there are a few exceptions to this, for example, Maybe a marketplace business might choose sign ups or GMV as their primary KPI. Or an early enterprise business with a long sales cycle might choose letters of intent. Secondary KPIs are things that need to be tracked, moving in the right direction, to make sure you're not cheating on your primary KPI. Or to give you an early signal when your primary KPI is very lagging. Here are some examples of secondary KPIs. Retention and churn, These are gonna actually contribute to your revenue growth, so they're very important to track. Unit economics. You need to make sure you're making money on each user and not giving away free money and calling it growth. Customer acquisition cost, depending on your stage, you may not need to optimize this right now. Just have a sense for your payback period and whether you'll make or lose money per customer acquired. Keep this list small and relevant. 3 to 5 secondary KPIs is reasonable. I've also included a short list here of vanity metrics. As we discussed earlier, it is very easy, even for good founders. To fall into the trap of prioritizing for these metrics. They feel good and they provide external validation. If you find these creeping into your task list, just ask yourself. Is this directly on my path to revenue growth? Is this my biggest blocker? To illustrate what a laser focus on growth looks like, I dug up some examples. Here's a side by side comparison of DoorDash on demo day, which everyone knows, and my own startup, Rick Shaw. Which was also a delivery platform. We went through YC right after DoorDash did, and DoorDash eventually acquired Rickshaw in 20 17. Both companies had a laser focus on order volume as a top line metric. This allowed for clear focused execution and resulted in strong and very similar early traction. However, post demo day, the path diverged a little bit. Rickshaw had a bit of trouble fundraising despite comparable early traction to DoorDash. This caused us to make a decision out of fear, and instead of continuing to have a clear focus on top line growth, as DoorDash did, we tried to optimize for both growth and unit economics. We tried to hedge, and this was very dangerous. This split focus put us in a weird no man's land of slow growth, which, as we described before, can kill startups. There's a lot more nuance about profitability versus growth that I won't get do here. The main message today is to choose your primary KPIs and don't try to get smart and optimize for 2 or more hard things.</span></div></div>

I'm Divia, and today I'm gonna talk a little bit about KPIs and prioritization for an early stage startup. This is my second batch as a visiting group partner here at YC. Where I've worked with hundreds of founders on hitting their demo day goals and navigating goal setting and execution as they search for product market fit. I myself am a 2 time YC founder and have also held leadership roles at several fast growth startups. Just as a heads up, I'm gonna be giving you some homework at the end of this talk. My hope is that today, we can improve the way you spend your time and expedite your journey to product market fit. So why are we talking about this? Now that you're a startup founder, there is nobody telling you how to spend your time. You might have heard some version of and not or. Implying that you have to turn over every rock and optimize every metric to build a successful startup. While this is true to some extent, you still have to choose how you're going to spend your time each Ultimately, as a startup founder, you wanna get to product market fit as quickly as possible. Prioritization matters, and having clarity on your KPIs is crucial for prioritization. Let's start by defining these terms. KPI stands for key performance indicator. These are the metrics that you track and report on, both internally and externally. These metrics make sure that you're measuring what matters, and they tell you whether what you're doing is worth prioritization tells you in what order you need to tackle your work each day. There are infinite things you could be doing each day, and your work is never done. But time is finite. Prioritization tells you how you spend your time each day, how you direct your team to spend their time each day when you have 1, And most importantly, prioritization helps you decide which super important things on your list you don't get to today. Here's what your task list may look like. Note that the highlighted items in yellow are the ones that I might decide to prioritize. Also note that every item on this list feels important. Yet only a few are likely to truly move your business forward and toward product market fit. In a world where you can't possibly get to everything, you need to prioritize the tasks that'll move you toward your KPIs faster. So why are KPIs and prioritization in 1 talk? Well, prioritization means that you're working on the things most likely to impact your top KPIs. So it's critical that you choose the right KPIs and that are honest with yourself about which tasks are most likely to move those KPIs. When you're moving fast, it's extra important to make sure you're running in the right direction. I'll use this analogy a few times today, so look out for it. We come across companies all the time who are working so hard, but optimizing for the wrong thing. We call these vanity metrics. Things that make you feel good and things that you can brag about on LinkedIn. At the end of the day, if you fall into the trap of making these your primary KPIs, you're going to be spending your time on the wrong things. So why are KPIs and prioritization important? Well, as a founder, no 1 is gonna tell you how to spend your time. It's very easy to feel busy and feel productive and not be moving your business forward. Here are some common examples of things you can be doing to feel busy today. Optimizing paperwork tasks, maybe we're good enough is all that you needed, perfectionism and craftsmanship on a feature that nobody's using anyway. Premature optimization or building for scale that you don't need to yet or choosing a more intellectually hard problem to solve rather than building what your users want. I remember in the early days of 1 of my companies, we were trying to pick a legal firm to work with. Sure, you need a lawyer and you need to pick need to pick a good lawyer. There are so many to interview, and so many of them wanted to take us out to lunch or to drinks, have us visit their offices, the works? You guys, this felt flattering and glamorous, we felt so busy. But at the end of the day, we hadn't even launched yeah, choose a good lawyer. No. This is not impacting your KPIs. Do it quickly and move on. Again, it's easy to run fast but in the wrong direction. You need to run fast and be running in the right direction. When you're doing a start up, time is at a premium The faster you get to market, the sooner you earn money and you can reinvest that money in your business and be less dependent on outside capital or Even if you want to keep raising, you'll have more leverage to raise money on better terms. Taking more time to get to market means you burn more money. Lastly, moving slowly means that competitors have more time to copy you and catch up. Time spent without making real progress also has an emotional and mental cost. And can raise red flags externally in fundraising and hiring. So don't waste time on</span></div></div>

Like, literally the rest of what I'm gonna say is base gonna be re summarized versions of that same thing. The second thing that an early stage startup needs to do is get some initial customers. Get anyone using your product. You don't have to have a vision on how you get everyone using it, but just anyone interacting and seeing if they get value out of the product. You'd be surprised at how many founders' journeys and before a single user has actually interacted with a product they've created. It's very very common. So please get past this step.

It was great talking to all of you. Thank you very much.</span></div></div>

First, time box your spec. So your spec is a list of stuff you need to build before you launch. Timebox it. Say, okay. What happens if I want to launch in 3 weeks? Okay. Well, the only things that could be on my spec are things I can build in 3 weeks. That makes your life a lot simpler. It allows you to remove all the features you can't build in 3 weeks. Second, write your spec This seems really straightforward, but most people fuck this 1 up. It's really easy to change what you're working on before you ever launch it because you never write it down. You start working on something, you talk to a user, they say, oh, I would never use that or God forbid, you talk to an investor, and they say, oh, that could never be a company. Because investors know everything. And so you decide to change what you're working on. And because you never wrote it down, you don't even really realize you're changing it. And so your 3 week plan turns into a 3 month plan. If you write shit down, at least you can be honest with yourself that you're changing your spec all the time. The next 1 is cut your spec A week into your kind of 3 week sprint, you probably realized that you added too many things to your spec and you're not gonna make your deadline. That's okay. Just cut the stuff that clearly isn't important. And if there's no nonimportant things, start cutting important things. Most of the goal here is just to get anything out in the world. Once you get anything out in the world, the momentum to keep anything going is extremely strong. Once you have any once you if you don't have anything on the world, it's very easy to just delay delay delay delay.</span></div></div>

This is 1 that's also extremely common mistake because most founders in their heads have a idea of what they want to build And so they kind of have this weird feeling that if I haven't built the full thing yet, getting feedback on the shitty initial thing is kind of useless. Of course, it's not gonna work. It's not the full thing. The full thing's gonna take 3 years, 10000000 dollars a whole team. So feedback on the little thing is useless. The reality is that in some ways the full thing is this really awesome idea in your head that you should keep in your head, but it should be very, very flexible because it might turn out the full thing that you wanna build isn't what your customers want at all. So I have this saying, hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer, tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely. And last most important, iterate. And I like to kind of distinguish between iterating and pivoting. A lot of founders once they've figured out how to build something fall in love with it. And so if it doesn't work for a certain set of users, they start thinking, well, I wonder what other problems this thing can solve. Well, you know, the screwdriver is not actually good at screwing in anything. But I wonder what other problems it could solve. And they're like, oh, maybe you can use it to cook. Maybe you can use it to clean. And it's like, no. Like the problem was I need to screw something in. The user was like a mechanic, And if your screwdriver doesn't help the mechanic solve the problem, keep the mechanic, keep the problem. I need to screw something in, fix the fucking screwdriver. Like, that's the thing that's broken. Right? The broken thing is not the mechanic, and it's not the fact that they need to screw something in. So iterate. Continue improving on your solution until it actually solves a problem.</span></div></div>

This doesn't mean you have to go into a 3 year kind of research situation or you have to work in industry for 10 years. But some conversations are helpful. It's even more helpful if you're your own user. So you can tell whether your product's working for you. I always get this strange question of how do I get my first users? Which always kind of confuses me because theoretically you decide to solve a problem that you know someone has, So the way you get your first user is you talk to that person that you know has the problem. And if it's you, it's even easier. So if you are building a product for a mysterious set of users that you have no idea who they are, question that slightly. Very slightly.</span></div></div>

They see big companies launch stuff and they assume that's what startups do. In fact, they see companies that kind of think about like startups. Facebook's not really a startup anymore. But they see them getting a lot of press and getting a lot of buzz and yada yada yada, and they have in their head that that's what a successful company looks like when they launch. Well, let me ask you this question. How many here remember the day that Google launched? No. How about Facebook? Okay. How about Twitter? No. Great. So it turns out that launches aren't that special at all. Okay? So if you have this magical idea of your magical launch you wanna do, throw it away. It's not that special. The number 1 thing that's really important is to get some customers. So to make people feel better, let's use different terms. How about launch is when you get any customers. And how about like press launch or press launch really impressive is when like people write about things and it's all exciting and you get all this buzz. Let's push the press launch off and let's push the get any customer's launch really, really soon. That's our goal here. It's a lot harder to learn from your customers when they don't have a product they can play with. You know, you can talk to your customer all day, but you have no idea whether thing you want to build can solve their problem. If you put the thing in front of them and it doesn't solve their problem, you know right away. And so all the research in the world is good, but until you can put something in front of people, you have no frigging idea whether it's gonna work. So spending all that time on a pitch deck is not as valuable as spending your time building anything that you can give to a customer.</span></div></div>

This is 1 of Airbnb's first landing pages in 2008, I believe. 1 of the things that you might be interested in about in Airbnb's first product is that there were no payments. When you found a place to stay on Airbnb, you had to exchange money with the host in person. Needless to say, that was a pretty fucking big problem, but they started without payments. No map view You know how when you search Airbnb, you can see where the house is in the city. You don't have that. Sorry. And the person writing all the code Nate was working part time. Okay? So everyone tells these kind of magical stories about how everything was perfect from the beginning. Airbnb, not perfect from the beginning. Next 1, Twitch. This was what Twitch looked like day 1. Not very familiar. Well, maybe a little familiar. There's some video there and there's some chat there. Other than that, nothing else. Twitch launched as Justin TV, which was a online reality TV show. There was only 1 channel, Justin. You had to follow his life. If you didn't like his life, you had to leave the website all there was. The video was extremely low resolution. It was funny. A founder asked me back in the day like, oh, like wasn't it weird you guys had video in your apartment? Weren't there all these like secret documents and things that like people would be able to see and it was like you could barely recognize our faces let alone documents that we had. And most importantly, there were no video games. No video games except if we decided to play video games in our apartment like that's the only time video games ever appeared. And so needless to say you can do that quickly. When you think about Twitch, it's much more complex now. Last stripe, which wasn't stripe. It was called slash dev slash payments because why not? Like let's make a name that's really easy to remember. This was Stripe day 1. No bank deals. I won't tell you exactly how they process payments, but It was in a very start up y way. Almost no features and even cooler if you wanted to use Right? The Stripe founders would come to your office and integrate it for you. How nice is that? Half because they were just desperate to get 1 to use it and half because there's great way to find bugs before the users found bugs. Integrate yourself. So these are just 3 examples of extremely simple, extremely fast to build MVPs. All of these are billion dollar companies, and they all started with something that most people would say is pretty shit</span></div></div>

I used to think that you could just execute well and not have to be able communicate. But the problem is that startups really require good communication, communication with your users, communication with potential investors, with your co founders, with potential employees. In effect a founder always has to be talking about their business and getting people excited about it. The number 1 mistake I see founders making is they can't actually explain what their business does. The best founders can in 1 or 2 sentences explain exactly what their business does and they can explain it to a customer, they can explain it to an investor, They can explain it to their mother. They could explain it to anyone of any level of knowledge about their industry and they can do it without stumbling. And I think that's ridiculously important because in order for you to get advice, investment to convince someone to join your company, they first have to understand what you do and you would be surprised how many founders can't clearly explain what they do well enough so that they can start selling you on how you can help them or join them. So once again, the 3 most important things I see that's separating our top 10 percent founders from anyone else is first, it's good to execute. Second, the resulting formidability you kind of respect them more. And third their ability clearly communicate what they're working on. Now</span></div></div>

You're gonna make bad decisions all the time. You're gonna have strong hypothesis that turns out to be wrong. And there's a type of person who doesn't get discouraged even if they make the wrong move 5 times or 5 times in a row. They stay passionate about the problem. They stay passionate about trying to find a solution. They keep on executing and moving forward.

Right? Very few companies don't raise, but Zapia, for example, never raised after YC demo. And I think because the business is so good, it's growing really well. They are EBITDA positive. They have very healthy margins. And, you know, often Wade would tell me this, like, I don't know what to do with my money in the bank. Why will I raise more? It's a great reason not to raise. Right? But if you are not in that luxurious situation, then, you know, there is something to be said about, I need capital to grow. Not necessarily for paid marketing. Don't please don't take this as paid marketing. This is another common mistake. But more like I need to hire more engineers, I need to hire ahead of time to build the things that I need because I know I have a business model at the end of it. So therefore, the way to think of fundraisers, if you think you are you you have a clear path to the next milestone, and you may need, like, you know, maybe 205 hundred or 1000000 dollars, then just raise that minimum amount, but come up with that plan very clearly. What is the money you need to hit that next next milestone and just raise that money because guess what your dilution matters? That's perfect.</span></div></div>

It was The second time they were building a company so they knew that they needed to do this. I I don't know if they did this in their first time, probably not. But When they were going through YC, they actually literally iterated from a VR startup idea to Brex, right, which is corporate curve cuts. And they had built FinTech in the past. But the both of them knew the stakes were high at least for them because they were dropping out of Stanford. They literally came out of Brazil to attend Stanford. They were dropping out at the university. And so they both wanted to make sure that Brex had a big opportunity. And before hiring a single person, they wrote down very clearly what Brex could be with all the products that they could build in the road map. Tested it for not like it was not a huge survey, but they just wrote it down to really understand, built a financial model, and we actually attended accounting class in Stanford because he had no idea how to build it. And he built a whole model year by year, tested the assumptions of market demand and what penetration they would need to hit for it to be at least a billion dollar company. And only after they after they both got comfortable that there is a path. And this is worth quitting stand for for and putting our entire life probably for the next 10, 15 years on this, they hired the first employee. That's is an amazing clarity of thought. Right? You I'm not saying everybody should be there, but you should at least do the first exercise. What is if you were to convince someone to join you, who and, you know, more often than not at this stage, whoever you want doesn't want to join you. So what is that compelling story?</span></div></div>

And I want you to know that if paid acquisition is the only way that you are able to grow your company, then I'm gonna discount that channel of growth greatly. That is because if you actually get really popular, you've actually start being someone significant, let's say, becoming a hundred million dollar revenue company. Then you're gonna attract a lot of competitors into space. And that advantage is gonna quickly dwindle over time. Blue Apron is a really good example. Of this. Almost all their acquisitions is in paid and then once they ate through that, there's almost nowhere else for them to sort of go. You want to find acquisition paths that cost no money. And my favorite companies, the ones that become really great are the ones that can grow by word-of-mouth. This is a good percentage of the way they grow. And so in the early days of your startup, if you don't have any money, that's actually very great way of exercising how do I grow this without having to pay for it? And so in the beginning we tell you to do things that don't scale. But this is what you sort of want to accomplish. It's like do I have an advantage that is free? And</span></div></div>

A lot of times people make the mistakes of trying to just accurately describe or over describe a lot of different parts. So I'm gonna break it this down. So just like a normal hypothesis has a pretty decent structure for this. This will hopefully help you sort of workshop like understanding, oh, this is exactly all the reasons why this should succeed. And so even before we start even building anything, we can have an understanding of like, oh, here's the potential path of this company, or here's the things I need to prove to show that this company could do well. So the first is the problem. So startup ideas come out as a 3 part, the first part is a problem, and it's basically the initial conditions. You have to explain to me like, what is the setting for this company? That allows it to be able to grow quickly. The second is the solution. So this is basically what is the experiment that you're basically running? Within those conditions for it to grow really quickly. And the third is, what's your insight? So what's your explanation why The thing that you're going to try, your experiment is going to end up being successful.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Says, good problems, they're popular. So a lot of people have the problem. You want to avoid problems that there's a small number of people that have it. We like problems that are growing. So therefore, the market, basically. Like, is it growing at a rate? That, like, more and more people are gonna be having the problem. And it's it's growing faster than other peoples or other types of problems. We like problems that are urgent, ones that need to be solved very, very quickly. We like problems that are really expensive to solve. Because if you're able to sort of solve it, then you can charge a lot of money potentially. We like problems that are mandatory. Right? So therefore, it's like, oh, people have this problem and they have to solve it. And then we like problems that are frequent, ones that people are gonna encounter over and over and over again. And often in a frequent time interval. So what you want to have is, like, some aspect of the problem that you're working on at least 1 of them, and it's ideal if you have multiple of them. You don't have to have all of them. But it's 1 of those things where it's like, if your company isn't growing, or if someone's not as excited about the problem, it's probably missing some of these characteristics. The last 1 about frequency is super important because I like problems, and you'll find a lot of other YC partners, like problems a lot that gives people a lot of opportunities to convert. Part of that has to do with some theory. So b j Fogg, he's a researcher at Stanford, and he tosses his formula up all the time. And he says, basically, if you're trying to change someone's behavior, you have 3 things you need to have in place. You need to have the motivation, the ability, and the trigger. They need to all happen at the same time. So the motivation is like, I have this problem, I need to solve, whatever it is, The ability is your startup. And then last is the trigger. What's gonna be the thing that gets them to all of a sudden realize, oh, I need to solve it with your thing. And so a lot of companies will have like, oh, I I build something, but for some reason no one's signing up or like they're not using it. They're not engaged. I have no retention. And a lot of the times is it's because it's like, you're hoping that they will somehow just remember on their own that they have the problem and to start using you. And oftentimes, most companies don't send enough, for example, email notifications. Or triggers or reminders, or figure out ways to come back into the app, or figure out ways to be back in front of the user at the right time. And if you can't figure out those opportunities, it's really hard to get people to switch over to using your solution, service, or product. So our ideal problems are millions of users. Right? Millions of people have it. Why people like to work on consumer companies. That's why some investors like to focus on them. We like markets that are growing 20 percent a year. The problem is growing quickly. We like problems where people are trying to solve it right now immediately. We like problems that just cost a ton of money, so billions of dollars. Right? Or at least they all add up to some billion dollar total addressable market. We like problems where the law has changed. The law has changed and regulation has put up there and now people have to solve a bunch of problems. You saw a ton of health care problem health care startups. We're born after Affordable Care Act was passed. And a lot of that had to do with like there was now all of a sudden opportunity. This problem that all these hospitals and clinics had to solve. And then we like problems that people need to solve multiple times a day, or we'll use it multiple times a day. Facebook's a good classic example, but people also be able to love Slack. Right? Because it's like, oh, I'm gonna be engaged and using it multiple times a day during the workday. Solution. So there there's pretty much only 1 piece of advice I really have for the solution</span></div></div>

Why are you gonna win versus everyone else. Why are you going to be the fastest 1 to sort of grow? Because that insight is what's needed for the investor to choose you over anyone else. And it has to be related to growth. You have to have an unfair advantage that explains why you're gonna grow quickly. If it's not related to that, then it's not it's not gonna be something that an investor is gonna find valuable. And the last 1 is you need 1. You can't just be like I have a problem. I'm solving it and I have no explanation why. Without that last sort of explanation, I can't use my imagination. I can't evaluate just solely on how well you've thought through this problem. Right? And so let's go through the types of unfair advantages that your company have. So there's 5 different types and companies do not have all of them. Really great ones surprising not surprising, we'll have all of them, and we'll go through 2 examples. But You want at least 1, and it's nice if you can have 2 or 3.

And so for us, it was basically every website needs to collect some kind of data some point, but you need to know how to code or hire a programmer to be able to do it. And so the solution was to build something that what they see is what they got. Like, basically, a drag and drop, visual editor, and that any nontechnical person sort of create. And then if we did that, we would solve that sort of specific problem. So very quickly, the market, it's kind of ridiculous like we were asked in the early days, calculate our TAM, but it was, like, every website needs to I don't really understand. Like, what website doesn't need to form eventually. It allowed us to grow really, really quickly. Our product was easily shown to be 10 x faster and it's against the direct competition with other builders. Because it was so much faster to do the drag and dropping and visually see. And then it was usually a hundred x faster than, like, a lot of traditional routes for very custom forms. For hiring a programmer and very cheaper because we had this freemium model. That also led to an acquisition unfair advantage. And so we actually had started off with building a blog and building an audience as well. Started off with a hundred thousand developers subscribed to our blog. We launched it out to them after building up that audience for a year, and that's actually what we applied to YC with. It's like we had built up this audience we have proved that all these other things are like in place. And then part of the other acquisition model is that you could embed these forms on people's website. And then our users basically spread our form and software for us as a result. So we never had to hire any salespeople. And the results are our product was used by every industry, market, and vertical you can imagine, tons of super large companies, and we did this with a relatively small amount of team. When we were acquired, we were a weird outlier compared to all the other acquisitions. The average company raises only raises like 25000000 dollars before an exit. And this is their average return. And for Wufu, we only raised a hundred 18000 for the whole life of the company, and our returns are over 30000 percent. Okay. So in the end, this is very simple exercise, but super enlightening when you actually go through it and to try to figure out that narrative and story. So I turn it back to you, go through, and try to answer those questions about problem solution, your unfair advantage. Figure out where are my holes? Do I have 1? And then the question becomes, oh, what do I need to prove? What do I need to work on to make that happen? Your startup idea is a hypothesis about why you're going to grow quickly. For our next lecture, we're gonna talk about the first ways we try to prove it out to basically test our hunches. And that is by talking to users.</span></div></div>

And that is don't start here. So what I mean by that is why see we have an acronym for a problem that we try to avoid or basically an application that we have to go like, oh, man. I wish they had started with the problem first, and we call it SISP. And it means solution in search of a problem. And often what happens is, like, you're an engineer. You're excited about technology. Some new technology has come on the scene. Let's say it's blockchain. Right? Let's say it's like React Native or whatever the new thing is and you're like, I wanna build something with this. It's a large reason why you start working on a side project. And then you go like, okay. What kind of problem can I solve now? I'm I wanna use this no matter what, and then you try to shoe horn a problem into the solution. And what ends up happening is that's a much more difficult way to grow the company. It's not impossible for companies to grow this way. But super inefficient. It's much better to be like let me see what problems people have and then I will use whatever is necessary to solve them. And therefore, it's much more likely that you will grow as a result. Because the other way around is you might have to go and try to drum up the problem or you have to like brand the problem as something that people have. And it's so much more difficult and you end up growing much more slowly as a result. So look at what you're building right now. Look at the reason why you're trying to do this startup. And is it because you only care about the technology and building something in that? Or have you started with a problem? You go, like, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to solve people, users, customers, issues.</span></div></div>

That's certainly not our advice, never been our advice, but, you know, we don't control the startups that run their own company. There's a broad range of what people think about this. I think some of our best companies are ones that have taken the stance that a diverse company is really important. From the earliest stages. And as other companies see Thanksgiving, for example, it's coming. It did an excellent job with that. And then many people think we'll be 1 of the most valuable companies we funded. And so as people see examples like that, I think other people are like, oh, maybe, actually, this is important and and this does work on it. I mean, there are, you know, there are the extreme cases where if you have the perfect 3 candidates in a row no matter sort of where they fit on the first specimens should probably hire them. But there's the other extreme case of where you spent no effort and you don't you don't understand the value a diversity brings. And so I think most of our startups understand the value there. Some for sure don't. And even some reason ones we funded don't, And 1 of the frustrations in the past of shareholder is that we don't get to tell people what to do. It's good and bad in that, but 1 of the bad is if someone doesn't wanna take this seriously, we can't make them. But I think by and large, the most successful companies tend to care about this pretty early on. And I think other people see that and say, okay. Maybe there's something to do this. Alright. Thank you all very much. I'm gonna stick around for a little bit if you have more questions. I will go talk to you.</span></div></div>

Well, You could you could just start, you know, a a company that won't take as long as you think. The problem is a lot of people have this idea, and markets are efficient. And so the easy companies to start are never that easy. And people that think they're going to sort of, like, build and get a 10000000 dollar exit in 12 months, generally get disappointed for a whole bunch of reasons. But that strategy never works as well as people seem to think it's going to work. I think the most certain way to become wealthy in the short term or at least wealthy enough is to go work at a company like Google or Facebook can get a crazy pay package. But what a lot of people wanna do is they actually wanna become wealthy so that they can start the hard company. And I understand that. I think that's a noble goal. But I don't think it's necessary. I think in today's funding climate, you can raise money. Even if you're a company that would've been unfashionable to fund 5 years ago. So if you only wanna become wealthy because you have this Life's work company you wanna do later. I would push on that, and I would say you don't have to. If you wanna become all because you want a bunch of sports cars, I understand that too. And then starting the hard company now doesn't help you. So I think it ends up as a as a personal decision, but it's worth it's worth really thinking about the motivations there. Now that imagine k 12 is part of YC, what role YC play in supporting imagine k 12 startups? There's just another education is now vertical, like, we're gonna do more companies in just like biotech or hardware enterprise. They'll have access to the same services as weiser companies. This is actually good at Sam. Yes, I suppose. What do I think of Google selling</span></div></div>
