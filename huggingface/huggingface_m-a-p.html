However, not because the Moon landings didn't happen. It is only because of the optical limitations of telescopes themselves, because of their limited size and distance from the Moon.\nand here is another\nThe outer Solar System is more richly endowed with moons than the inner regions. The two enormous gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, have numerous moons of various sizes, shapes, and origins. As these enormous planets grew, during the early days of our Solar System, they were able to ensnare wandering objects with their mighty gravitational grips.\nPlanetary scientists believed for years that Earth's Moon is depleted of water and other volatile compounds. However, this idea began to change in 2008, when a team of scientists announced that they had detected traces of water in some of the volcanic glass beads carried back to Earth from the Apollo 15 and 17 missions to the Moon. In 2011, additional study of extremely small crystalline formations within those beads revealed that they contain amounts of water that are similar to some basalts on Earth. This indicates that the lunar mantle--at least, part of it--contains as much water as Earth's.\n- Biggest Volcano In The Solar System\n- Cool Pictures Of The Planet Mars\n- NASA Comet Track\n- Landscape in Other Planets\n- Distance Between the Solar System\n- Eagle Nebula Star Birth\n- Johannes Kepler Kepler NASA Mission\n- The Water Planet Company\n- Days to Mars\n- River Song Astronaut Outfit\n- NASA Mentoring Program\n- Blue Nebula Background\n- Gold Nebula\n- Mars Lander Valley of the Moon\n- Gliese 581 G\nThere are ongoing studies assessing the past habitability potential of the Red Planet, as well as the possibility of life.\nThe research published in the July 4, 2016 issue of Nature Geoscience highlights the main factor differentiating moon-birth around Mars and Earth: the differing rotation speeds of the two planets prompted \&quot;completely different tidal actions,\&quot; Dr. Charnoz explained in the July 4, 2016 CNRS Press Release. Dr. Charnoz proposes that at the time of their respective impacts, \&quot;Earth took less than four hours to spin on its axis whereas Mars rotated very slowly over a 24-hour period.\&quot; The result of this important difference caused Earth to hold on to its single, large Moon, while the Martian collision created a dozen smaller moons alongside a larger moon. As time went by, Martian tidal action--resulting from the planet's slow rotation rate--caused most of the moons, including the largest one, to crash back down to the surface of their parent-planet. As a result, only the two most distant moons, Phobos and Deimos, survived as testimony to the ancient catastrophe.\nMost of Saturn's natural satellites are very small and icy dancing moonlets. However, the larger, icy midsized moons twirl around their enormous ringed planet in a lovely and mysterious dance. The largest of the icy moons is Rhea, Saturn's second-largest moon after the weird world that is Titan. Iapetus, the third largest of Saturn's moons, is two-faced, with one side composed of gleaming, very bright, highly reflective ice, and the other, dark and non-reflective, a blackened splotch staining the pristine white ice. Iapetus is larger than Mimas and Enceladus. There is an enormous impact crater on the moon Mimas, that stands out as a prominent feature on what is apparently a badly bombarded, heavily cratered world. The large impact crater Herschel on this 400-kilometer moon was excavated by a tumbling chunk of space-stuff made of rock, ice, or both, that came very close to powdering the entire little moon. Another icy moon, Enceladus, is a bewitching world, 500-kilometers in diameter, that is thought to harbor a global subsurface ocean beneath its frozen crust. Where there is liquid water there is always the possibility--though, by no means, the promise--of life. Enceladus also has the highest albedo of any other moon in our Solar System. This means that it has the most dazzlingly bright reflective surface. It also possesses a very active geology, rendering it almost free of craters because it is constantly being resurfaced by the emissions of gushing icy geysers that are responsible for fresh snow that keeps the surface of the little moon sparkling and smooth.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.roboticstomorrow.com/shownews/AUVSI13&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2018-02-20T19:29:58&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-09/segments/1518891813088.82/warc/CC-MAIN-20180220185145-20180220205145-00764.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.8943639993667603,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.894364&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:984,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;984&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2018-09&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2018-09__0__244559644&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Closer to Your End of Arm Tool: AGS Web Site with Enhanced Customer Portal We demonstrate it on the K-Show 2013 in Düsseldorf Hall 10 Both C28 https://inside.ags-automation.de/kundenportal/Custom/AGS_Registrierung.aspx Webside www.ags-automation.de\nUAV Helicopter Integrating IMT Transmitter Provides Civilian and Military Law Enforcement And First Responders With Reliable Aerial Surveillance Solution\nAeroVironment Receives $13.5 Million Order from United States Army for RQ-11B Raven Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Gimbaled Payloads\nFourth and final order received for fiscal 2012 contract with total value of $59.6 million---- AeroVironment's Mantis™ gimbaled sensor payloads dramatically improve troops' capabilities as integrated element of Raven unmanned aircraft system\nPleased to be showcasing these solutions for the first time in the United States at AUVSI\n3D Systems announced today plans to exhibit its aerospace and defense 3D content-to-print solutions at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI 2013) Conference and Exposition.\nThe student teams are exhibiting their aircraft and discussing their competition experience\nEMCORE Corporation, a leading provider of compound semiconductor-based components and subsystems for the fiber optics and space solar power markets, today announced the release of the new EMP-3, EMP-4 and EMP-7 Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) modules, expanding the Company's EMP FOG platform with the latest generation navigational grade fiber optic gyro technology.\nSafety is number one to ensure integration\nFreefly Systems has created the ultimate aerial platform.\nCONTROP USA Inc. to Exhibit New Advancements in Small-to-Medium Electro-Optical / Infrared Stabilized Cameras\nProducts will be exhibited at AUVSI's Unmanned Systems 2013 Expo in Washington, D.C. on August 12-15.\nSolid Concepts will display cutting edge unmanned vehicles and manufacturing technologies at the show this year.\nThe drug-busting, drone-launching Stiletto goes unmanned as the Mistral USV, a smaller sized craft with the same great stability, payload and patented M-hull Technology® of its predecessor combined with state-of-the-art C2 control and modular cargo handling system.\nNeya Systems LLC to Continue its Management Role for Department of Defense Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Control Segment (UCS) Architecture\nFollowing the successful completion of the Office of the Secretary of Defense UCS Architecture Release 3.0 in June 2013, Neya Systems LLC has been selected to continue management of the UCS Working Group for Release 3.1.

The product portfolio includes the UR5 and UR10 models that handle payloads of up to 11.3 lbs. and 22.6 lbs. respectively. The six-axis robot arms weigh as little as 40 lbs. with reach capabilities of up to 51 inches. Repeatability of +/- .004\&quot; allows quick precision handling of even microscopically small parts. After initial risk assessment, the collaborative Universal Robots can operate alongside human operators without cumbersome and expensive safety guarding. This makes it simple and easy to move the light-weight robot around the production, addressing the needs of agile manufacturing even within small- and medium sized companies regarding automation as costly and complex. If the robots come into contact with an employee, the built-in force control limits the forces at contact, adhering to the current safety requirements on force and torque limitations. Intuitively programmed by non-technical users, the robot arms go from box to operation in less than an hour, and typically pay for themselves within 195 days. Since the first UR robot entered the market in 2009, the company has seen substantial growth with the robotic arms now being sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001212X21846&amp;key=1&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2014-11-27T14:31:11&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2014-49/segments/1416931008720.43/warc/CC-MAIN-20141125155648-00111-ip-10-235-23-156.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9528744220733643,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.952874&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:341,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;341&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2014-49&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2014-49__0__100411384&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;NTSB Identification: NYC00LA238.\nThe docket is stored in the Docket Management System (DMS). Please contact Records Management Division\nAccident occurred Wednesday, August 23, 2000 in NEWBERRYPORT, MA\nProbable Cause Approval Date: 04/06/2001\nAircraft: Aviat A-1B, registration: N475C\nInjuries: 2 Uninjured.\nNTSB investigators may have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.\nThe pilot reported that he performed a wheel landing with a 90-degree crosswind from the left of about 8 knots. As the tail wheel was being lowered and the flaps raised, the airplane became 'squirrelly'. The pilot added power for a 'go-around', and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. According to the FAA, the airplane departed the runway at a 30-degree angle and continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. Continuous tire tracks from the airplane were observed from the runway to the accident site. A pilot rated passenger reported that he told the front seat pilot to cut the power when the airplane departed the runway. However there was no response, and he closed the throttle before impact.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during landing and a subsequent rejected landing. Factors were the crosswind, and the delayed corrective action by the pilot.

The jets escorted the shuttle until it landed.\nOfficials did not initially approach the craft for fear that some alien life form might have hijacked it. It was only after Bresnik emerged from the shuttle, hailed a taxi and went to his final destination, a Five Guys Restaurant nearby, that they were sure the creature was indeed the missing shuttle astronaut.\nDesperate to avoid a scandal, NASA arranged for a secret shuttle launch from Annenberg Air Force Base to get him back to the International Space Station before anyone missed him. The flight from the west coast launch site was later described to the press as a top secret military mission.\nOnce safely back at the station Bresnik shared his ill-gotten booty with his mates. \&quot;The round trip took twenty three hours and cost over $60 million dollars, but it was worth it!.\&quot; beamed Bresnik. \&quot;Those Five Guys, they make some tasty burgers!\&quot;&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/168arw.htm&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2022-11-28T21:25:22&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-49/segments/1669446710662.60/warc/CC-MAIN-20221128203656-20221128233656-00491.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9440545439720154,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.944055&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1452,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,452&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2022-49&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2022-49__0__192306481&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;168th Air Refueling Wing [168th ARW]\nThe 168th Air Refueling Wing operates ten KC-135R Strato Tankers from Eielson AFB, about 20 miles south of Fairbanks. Eielson has been home for the Wing since 1986. Approximately 700 Alaskans serve as members of the unit.\nThe 168 ARW transfers more fuel than any other Air National Guard (ANG) tanker group, because nearly all receivers are active duty aircraft, many of which are on operational missions. The 168 ARW is the only Arctic-region refueling unit for all of PACAF, and maintains a substantial number of personnel on active duty and civilian technician status in order to meet its daily operational requirements. The Wing's Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) is eight KC-135s.\nThe mission of the 168th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is to train and equip KC-135R combat crews to provide air refueling in support of PACAF Operations Plans (OPLANS). Our peacetime mission provides air refueling training and exercise support for all 11th Air Force AWACS and fighter aircraft as well as alert tankers and crews to support Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) plans and RC-135X/S reconnaissance (RECCE) refueling requirements. Besides a federally directed mission requirement, as a unit of the Alaska National Guard, the 168 ARW is an asset of the Governor of Alaska. As such, the Governor can direct the unit to respond to emergencies declared or missions required within the State.\nThe 168 ARW was activated on October 25, 1986 as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS). It traces its lineage to the 437th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), originally activated at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, in June of 1942. Its aircraft were the Martin B-26 \&quot;Marauder\&quot; and the North American B-25 \&quot;Mitchell\&quot;. The 437th served with distinction in both the European and Pacific theaters of World War Two, earning the French Croix de Guerre (with palm) for action over Italy and France during April-June 1944, two Presidential Unit Citations for operations over Rome and Florence in 1944, and nine combat streamers for campaigns in which it flew. In January of 1945 the 437th was transferred to Okinawa for participation in the Ryuku Islands Campaign and the Air Offensive in Japan, the closing chapters of WWII.\nIn May of 1946 the 437th was redesignated as the 168th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and allocated to the Illinois Air National Guard. It flew B-26s and was stationed at Chicago's Orchard Place Airport, now O'Hare International Airport. The unit was called to active duty for service in France from 1951-53. In 1954 it was redesignated the 168th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, and flew the famous North American F-51 \&quot;Mustang\&quot;. In 1955 it received the F-84 \&quot;Thunderstreak\&quot; jet, becoming the 168th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. In 1957 it flew the F-86L \&quot;Sabre\&quot; jet. In May of 1958, the 168th's aircraft and personnel were assigned to other units, but the 168th's unit designation remained on the state's rolls -- a \&quot;technical deactivation\&quot;. Almost thirty years later, the unit was reactivated as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron and assigned to the Alaska Air National Guard.\nFrom a modest beginning in 1986, the unit has blossomed into full Wing status. Its commitments include providing Alert aircraft in support of NORAD and JCS-directed reconnaissance sorties, mobilization for support of PACAF war plans, and support of worldwide refueling taskings.\nThe 168 ARW, with an authorized end strength of 700 personnel, has command and control over twelve subordinate assigned units whose missions includes all aircraft maintenance for nine PACAF gained KC-135R model aircraft, providing financial, transportation, contracting, and base supply resources, communications, data processing, and visual information functions, organizational security, disaster preparedness and air base operability, all personnel activities including training, social actions and recruiting, and limited diagnostic and therapeutic service in general medicine, flight medicine, bioenvironmental, environmental, and dental services. Assigned units are the 168th Operations Group (OG), to include the 168th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS) and the 168th Operations Support Flight (OSF); the 168th Logistics Group (LG), to include the 168th Maintenance Squadron (MXS), 168th Aircraft Generation Squadron (AGS), 168th Logistics Squadron (LS) and the 168th Logistics Support Flight (LSF); the 168th Support Group (SPTG), to include the 168th Mission Support Flight (MSF) and the 168th Communications Flight (CF); and the 168th Medical Squadron (MDS).\nBecause of Alaska's strategic location with regard to national defense, the mission and importance of the 168 ARW and the Alaska Air National Guard should continue to increase in the coming years. The 168 ARW has a remarkably broad range of responsibilities which it fulfills in an exemplary manner, providing an outstanding example for all other Air National Guard units to follow. With a proven capacity to perform, we are ready to face the challenges of the future and are confident of our ability to accomplish any assigned mission.\nIn January 1994 and again in January 1996, the 168 ARW received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for exceptionally meritorious service both in the Alaskan and Southwest Asian theaters for the periods of January 8, 1991 to January 7, 1993 and January 8, 1993 to June, 1995. This is merely the latest in a long history of achievement throughout the 168th's lineage.\nThe 168th Air Refueling Wing is the embodiment of teamwork in the new, streamlined American military.\nThe upper right of the shield consists of a compass rose against a yellow background. The compass rose signifies the global nature of the Wing mission and is set at a 30 degree angle to the east representing the magnetic variation of Alaska where the Group was first formed. The yellow background represents the midnight sun at our latitude and the day aspect of the air refueling mission. The lower left of the shield depicts a red lightning bolt running from cloud to cloud against a blue background. The red lightning bolt signifies the projection of military power, the clouds are the medium in which we perform our mission, and the blue background the Arctic night and the night aspect of our mission. The red lightning bolt is also a prominent feature of the squadron patch from which the 168th Air Refueling Group/Wing evolved. Between the yellow and blue fields is a bar of ultramarine blue containing eight yellow stars. The ultramarine blue is Air Force blue representing our role in the Total Force; it is also the background color of the Alaska flag. The eight yellow stars are the stars of the big dipper also found on the Alaska flag.\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2020/06/24/spacex-set-enter-double-digit-launches-starlink-internet/3233389001/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2023-02-03T03:33:23&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764500042.8/warc/CC-MAIN-20230203024018-20230203054018-00384.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9455360174179077,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.945536&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:842,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;842&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-06&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2023-06__0__23933175&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;SpaceX Starlink launch pushes another 24 hours\nUPDATE: This SpaceX Starlink satellite launch is now slated to liftoff from Kennedy Space Center Friday June 26 at 4:18 p.m.\nWhen a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches from Kennedy Space Center Thursday late afternoon, it'll officially push the company's Starlink efforts into the double digits and act as a reminder that multitudes more are still on the way.\nSlated for a 4:39 p.m. liftoff from pad 39A, the tenth launch of roughly 60 internet-beaming Starlink satellites will push the constellation's size to nearly 600 in low-Earth orbit. Weather for the 10-minute window is expected to be 40% \&quot;go,\&quot; according to the Space Force.\nAfter liftoff, the rocket's 162-foot first stage will target an automated drone ship landing in the Atlantic Ocean. It should return to Port Canaveral for checkouts and refurbishment a few days later.\nThursday's launch is yet another in SpaceX's 2020 cadence, which to date has produced 10 total launches. If schedules hold, the Space Coast could see at least that many more before the year is out thanks to a combination of Starlink, commercial, and military missions.\nWith this tenth launch of Starlink, SpaceX appears to be inching ever closer to its goal of opening up broadband services on the ground. Private beta testing is expected to open this summer for users such as early investors, while a public beta should begin this fall for those in the higher latitudes of North America.\nTo access the constellation, users just need a pizza box-sized, circular antenna known as a ground terminal.\n\&quot;Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in and point at sky,\&quot; SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via Twitter last week. \&quot;Can be done in either order.\&quot;\nInternet access via satellite isn't new. For decades, various companies, including Microsoft-supported Teledesic in the late 1990s, have attempted to monetize the potential for anyone in any location on Earth to use broadband internet, but most have failed. Some were smaller spacecraft in low orbit, while others have been larger satellites thousands of miles above Earth.\nBut the distance of those geostationary satellites means the delay between asking for a data transfer and it actually occurring – known as latency – is a real challenge. Measured in milliseconds, the average terrestrial internet user can expect somewhere under 100ms to be sufficient. Most in-home service these days can deliver 50ms or less, according to internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.\nOne of Starlink's advantages is that its satellites sit roughly 340 miles above Earth, a distance that allows SpaceX to reduce latency. CEO Elon Musk expects current performance at around 20ms.\n\&quot;It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games,\&quot; he said last week. \&quot;Version 2, which is at lower altitude, could be as low as 8ms latency.\&quot;\nDuring previous conferences with reporters, Musk has emphasized that SpaceX doesn't need to have tens of thousands of satellites in orbit to start effectively delivering service – it could begin with as few as 1,000. Having more in orbit affords the ability to attract more customers from different regions, as well as improve performance in areas already being served.\nIn regulatory filings, the company has said it could launch as many as 40,000 of the flat spacecraft, though that remains to be seen.

Since the Drones Helsinki Declaration in 2017, which called for simple and performance-based rules for drones, significant progress has been made in developing and delivering a regulatory framework that will support the safe and sustainable growth of the drone industry. However, in order to facilitate the integration of drones in very low-level airspace (i.e. below 500 ft) and preserve the high level of safety in the entire European airspace, we jointly call to accelerate the implementation of the following measures.\n1. Extensive public awareness campaign The general public, including recreational/occasional drone users, as well as commercial clients, must be aware of the safety risks, duties, liabilities, insurance requirements, responsibilities and third-party privacy issues associated with drone operations. These are essential requirements as lack of awareness and negligence could result in safety incidents and accidents. Therefore, more resources must be dedicated to this aspect of drone integration in the airspace.\n2. Mandatory training and certificate/license relevant to operations The obligation for drone pilots to obtain a certificate or license aligned with EU regulation – depending on the properties, performance and features of the drone – creates awareness and mandates knowledge of the applicable regulations and restrictions as well as helping to develop the necessary skills. Practical training and theoretical knowledge requirements for unmanned aircraft pilots constitute an important safety net to prevent drone incidents or accidents. A solid knowledge and skills base is therefore a must, considering the complexity of the national and European airspaces and related aviation regulations. We are all one in the sky There is only one sky and all stakeholders, new and traditional, need to collaborate to keep it safe, secure, efficient and fair. The Signatories\nThe undersigned ATM Professional Staff Organisations note with great regret yet another attack of Airlines for Europe (A4E) on the European Air Traffic Management in the form of a joint letter of A4E member airlines’ CEOs to the European Air Navigation Service providers (ANSPs). The letter enumerates a number of ATM-related issues as cause for the delays.\nToday, unmanned aircraft are being used among other things for aerial filming and photographing, safety inspections of pipelines or buildings or by farmers. Tests are being performed for delivery of goods or even transport of passengers.\nThe Aviation Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in December 2015 states: \&quot;unmanned aircraft share the same airspace with other aircraft [and therefore] the safety of their operations must remain coherent with the overall aviation safety policy. Finally, unmanned aircraft operations must also be consistent with air traffic rules as laid down in the Common Rules of the Air.\&quot;\nDue to the rapid development of RPAS, the ETF strongly supports the inclusion of RPAS into the scope of the EASA Basic Regulation, as well as other regulatory initiatives aiming to ensure a safe co-existence of manned aircraft and RPAS in line with the principle \&quot;one sky – one safety\&quot;.\ndownload ETF views : etf-views-on-rpas-151216\nETF CO-SIGNS THE JOINT STAKEHOLDER STATEMENT ON DRONES\nThe ETF has joined other stakeholders from manned aviation in the call for a robust harmonized EU-wide regulatory safety framework for drones. The signatories also expressed their serious concern about the safety of manned aircraft in controlled and uncontrolled airspace.\nAt the same time, the ETF expects that all the safety and security aspects of drone operations will be addressed in the current revision of the EASA Basic Regulation.\nThe Remote Tower technology is advancing rapidly. It is important that regulators, Air Navigation Service Providers and staff engage on the subject to ensure that where remote towers are deployed, they are done so in a way that is safe, measured and with the appropriate consideration for staff. The technology has advanced ahead of proper regulation and a consistent and considered effort is now required by all stakeholders to ensure the appropriate regulatory environment is created. The social consequences need to be properly considered and the arising issues must be addressed. Whilst the ETF is generally supportive of the concept, provided it is deployed taking in to consideration the themes contained in this document, the ETF absolutely rejects the concept of simultaneous operations, i.e. the operation of more than one airport at the same time by one person. The ETF will continue to engage with all stakeholders and take a leading role as Remote Tower technology becomes more widely introduced\nA delegation from the ITF met informally with representatives of ICAO in order to foster more effective working relationship.\nThe ITF delegation comprised Joe Magee, Suresh Tewari, Mike Reed, Luigi d'Iddio and Safiyanu Mohammed Dauda.\nICAO representatives comprised:\nSteve Creamer: Director, Air Navigation Bureau, ICAO\nChris Dalton: Chief, Airspace Management and Oprimization, ICAO\nDiscussions covered the broad areas of technology and automation, remote tower funtions and the upcoming ICAO conference on this subject, fostering appropriate and effective working relationshp and of course fatigue management.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://news.nestia.com/detail/-/6962437&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2022-01-18T20:14:49&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-05/segments/1642320300997.67/warc/CC-MAIN-20220118182855-20220118212855-00426.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9677255153656006,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.967726&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:399,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;399&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2022-05&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2022-05__0__184012433&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;BERLIN The European Space Agency (ESA) hopes to hire and launch the world's first physically disabled astronaut, and several hundred would-be para-astronauts have already applied for the role, ESA head Josef Aschbacher said.\nThe 22-member space programme has just closed its latest decennial recruitment call for astronauts and received more than 22,000 applicants.\n\&quot;We would like to launch an astronaut with a disability, which would be the first time ever,\&quot; Dr Aschbacher told Reuters on Friday. \&quot;But I'm also happy for ESA because it shows that space is for everyone, and that's something I'd like to convey.\&quot;\nThe ESA, whose Ariane rocket once dominated the market for commercial satellite launches, faces ever stiffer competition from tech-funded upstarts like Mr Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Mr Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nThe challenges are immense: the ESA's 7 billion (S$11.2 billion) budget is a third of Nasa's, while its seven or eight launches a year are dwarfed by the 40 carried out by the United States.\nDr Aschbacher, who grew up staring at the stars above his parents' mountain farm in Austria, said he applied to become an ESA astronaut when he was a student. But what was once a geeky, niche enthusiasm has now become mainstream, he said.\nThis year's job advertisement attracted almost three times the 8,000 applications received a decade ago, and a quarter of them were from women, up from just 15 per cent before.\nThe ESA has promised to develop technologies to ensure that those with disabilities, like shortened legs, play a full part.\nAnd those astronauts will go beyond the International Space Station: some will be deployed to the US' planned Gateway station orbiting the Moon, while the ESA's member states are considering an invitation from Chinese and Russian space agencies to participate in their similar moonbase project.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2016/08/25/spacecom-sold-to-chinese/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2018-01-21T12:49:37&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-05/segments/1516084890582.77/warc/CC-MAIN-20180121120038-20180121140038-00435.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9494121670722961,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.949412&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:159,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;159&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2018-05&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2018-05__0__153367316&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Spacecom is to be sold to the Chinese-backed Luxembourg Space Telecommunications for $285 million.\nLuxembourg Space Telecommunications is owned by the Chinese communications company Beijing Xinwei Technology.\nSpacecom, which is controlled by Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication, has been looking for a buyer for two years.\nThe company’s Amos fleet currently consists of four satellites.\nIts primary customers include the Israeli DTH operator Yes and also has customers in Central &amp; Eastern Europe and Africa.\nThe Amos 6 communications satellite is scheduled to be launched from Florida’s Cape Canaveral the first week of September.

The first challenge is to accurately locate the melting layer. A new image-processing-based algorithm is proposed and demonstrated. The next challenge is to use the dual-polarimetric data above the melting level to distinguish regions containing super-cooled liquid water, which constitutes an aviation icing hazard, from regions of pure ice and snow. It has been well documented that the S-band dual-polarimetric radar signatures at individual range gates of super-cooled liquid water and ice crystals overlap significantly, complicating the identification of icing conditions using individual radar measurements. Recently several investigators have found that the aggregate characteristics of dual-polarimetric radar measurements over regions on the order of several kilometers show distinguishing features between regions containing super-cooled liquid and those with ice only. In this study, the features found in the literature are evaluated, extended and combined using a fuzzy-logic framework to provide an icing threat likelihood. The results of this new algorithm are computed using data collected in Colorado from the Colorado State University CHILL radar and the National Center for Atmospheric Research S-Pol radar (collectively called FRONT – The Front Range Observational Testbed) collected in the winter of 2010/2011 in coordination with the NASA Icing Remote Sensing System (NIRSS) and compared to pilot reports on approach or departure from nearby airports. The preliminary results look encouraging and will be presented. The ultimate goal is to produce an end-to-end algorithm to produce a reliable icing threat product that can then be combined with existing icing detection systems to improve their performance.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.ac-innov.com/liste_equipement/launcher-r%C2%B2-240/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2020-11-29T07:50:06&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-50/segments/1606141197278.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20201129063812-20201129093812-00308.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9284662008285522,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.928466&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:109,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;109&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2020-50&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2020-50__0__39675728&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fly-R has developped a launcher for each of its two smaller aircraft.

India’s homegrown Light Combat Helicopter [LCH] Program is\nfacing technical problems as the helicopter is said to be overweight for high altitude missions. The Indian Army and Air Force need the LCH to replace Russian Mi-35 helicopters. The LCH is scheduled to enter service by 2012 but the latest technical problems could delay the whole program.\nSources in India’s State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) which is developing the LCH said, “The helicopter is overweight by as much as 600 kilograms which will make it difficult for smoother operations in the upper reaches. Indian defence forces need LCH to replace the aging Russian Mi-35 for logistic and combat purposes in higher reaches of the northern Jammu and Kashmir and also along the Indo-Chinese border.\nLCH is a twin-engined, 5.5-ton helicopter and will carry air-to-air missiles, 20mm guns, unguided rockets and cluster bombs, grenade launchers and anti-radiation missiles.\nThe helicopter will be equipped with missile warning systems, anti-missile countermeasures, and night-attack-capable cockpit displays. Its narrow fuselage will be stealthy, and its landing gear will be built to handle hard landings.\nIn addition, LCHwill carry a homegrown gyro-stabilized sighting system comprising a high-performance thermal imager and laser rangefinder with a four-kilometer detection range of a NATO tank target. Known as the Heliborne-Thermal Imaging System (HELITIS), it provides a stabilization accuracy of 30 micro-radians and is intended for target recognition and engagement. Most of the weaponry and equipment is being procured from overseas defence companies.\nCurrently, the weapons and other equipment are being tested on the weaponised version of the Advance Light Helicopter (ALH), produced by HAL.\nThe LCH is intended to shoot down UAVs and slow-moving aircraft, escort troop-carrying copters on special operations, destroy enemy air defenses, fight in urban environments, and destroy tanks and other vehicles.\nLCH is scheduled to enter service by 2012, but technical problems with weight could mean the helicopter could be delayed as the users, the Indian Army and Air Force are likely to reject an overweight LCH.\n“Both the Indian Army and Air Force have a Requirement for around 150 LCHs, in case LCH is delayed, the Indian defence ministry may have to go for a global hunt for this category of helicopter,” said a senior official in the Indian Ministry of Defence. There is an increased demand for LCH category of helicopters due to greater vigil on the Indo-Chinese border added the official.\nIndia is strengthening its defences along the Indo-Chinese border, which are along higher reaches in the Himalayas and need to support LCH-type helicopters for logistics.\nRecently the Indian Navy asked the Indian defence ministry to buy Medium Lift Helicopters from the overseas market and not wait for HAL’s program.\nHAL took up the Medium Lift Helicopter program nearly five years ago, but has still to find an international partner. There is a total demand of over 350 Medium Light Helicopters by the three wings of the Indian defence forces, with a major chunk required from the Indian Navy.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://pilottrainingreviews.com/instructor/steve-mayes&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-23T02:33:57&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296818452.78/warc/CC-MAIN-20240423002028-20240423032028-00434.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9225578904151917,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.922558&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:112,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;112&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__95557326&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I received my Commercial airplane single &amp; multi engine land instrument airplane; flight instructor single &amp; multi land airplane And ground instructor advanced &amp; instrument in 1986.I am the owner of Take Flight E.A.

The airline transport pilot and his passenger were not injured, but the aircraft, which was owned and operated by Teton Holding Company, LLC, sustained substantial damage. The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight, which departed Rexburg, Idaho, about 15 minutes prior to the accident, was being operated in visual meteorological conditions. No flight plan had been filed. There was no report of an ELT activation. Use your browsers 'back' function to return to synopsisReturn to Query Page\nAccording to the pilot, who was landing in calm wind condition, the touchdown and beginning of the landing roll were uneventful. But as the aircraft began to slow, it started to drift to the right and he attempted to apply corrective rudder inputs. During his attempt to realign the aircraft with the runway, the soles of the hiking boots he was wearing got caught on either the edge of the rudder pedals or on each other. He was therefore momentarily unable to apply the appropriate corrective inputs, and by the time he was able to freely move his feet, the aircraft had entered a ground loop from which he was unable to recover. During the ground loop, the aircraft departed the runway, encountered soft terrain and nosed over.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/34-officers-dumped-from-u-s-nuclear-missile-force-for-cheating-on-proficiency-tests&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-12-03T01:42:43&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-49/segments/1637964362571.17/warc/CC-MAIN-20211203000401-20211203030401-00488.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9527069330215454,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.952707&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:317,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;317&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2021-49&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2021-49__0__149038807&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;From Associated Press:\nWASHINGTON — In a stunning setback for a nuclear missile force already beset by missteps and leadership lapses, the U.S. Air Force disclosed on Wednesday that 34 officers entrusted with the world’s deadliest weapons have been removed from launch duty for allegedly cheating — or tolerating cheating by others — on routine proficiency tests.\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\nThe cheating scandal is the latest in a series of Air Force nuclear stumbles documented in recent months by The Associated Press, including deliberate violations of safety rules, failures of inspections, breakdowns in training, and evidence that the men and women who operate the missiles from underground command posts are suffering burnout. In October the commander of the nuclear missile force was fired for engaging in embarrassing behaviour, including drunkenness, while leading a U.S. delegation to a nuclear exercise in Russia.\nA “profoundly disappointed” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, the service’s top civilian official, told a hurriedly arranged Pentagon news conference that the alleged cheating at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, was discovered during a previously announced probe of drug possession by 11 officers at several Air Force bases, including two who also are in the nuclear force and suspected of participating in the cheating ring.\n“This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour,” James said of the cheating, which Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said could be the biggest such scandal in the history of the missile force.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.thespacestore.com/product-p/smithsonian-shuttle-pullback.htm&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2015-01-25T03:49:35&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-06/segments/1422118059355.87/warc/CC-MAIN-20150124164739-00054-ip-10-180-212-252.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.7568578720092773,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.756858&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:258,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;258&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2015-06&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2015-06__0__31842330&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Join the Community\nWhy shop with us?\n(0 items: $0.00)\nShop Toys by Interest\nAstronauts &amp; Space Shuttles\nSmithsonian Discovery Space Shuttle Die cast Pullback 8\&quot; x 6\&quot;\nStock Status:(Out of Stock)\nSmithsonian Discovery Space Shuttle - Diecast Pullback 8\&quot; x 6\&quot;\nChildren will love this large diecast metal replica of the famous Space Shuttle Discovery.

You can watch as Nyberg then floats across the station. (And, yes, there’s a connection to Sandra Bullock and the movie Gravity, as you’ll see.)\nThis isn’t her first hair-related video. In July, Nyberg demonstrated how she washes those long locks.\nThe 44-year-old Nyberg, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas, flew on a Space Shuttle Discovery mission to the space station in 2008. Her second trip to space began on May 28. She’s scheduled to return to Earth on Nov. 10.\nCopyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.\nThis entry was posted in News from NPR\n.

The first production airframe, designated F-89A, took to flight in September 1950 with two permanently mounted wingtip fueltanks. After the first major upgrade to the B-version, the aircraft entered active service in 1951, but severe problems were found with several systems, including the engines. The C-version soon came to life, but soon the major production model m, the F-89D started rolling out of the factories.\nThe D-version separated itself from its predecessor by replacing the wingtip fueltanks with underwing droptanks, so to make room for two wingtip mounted 70 mm rocket pods, arming the F-89D with 104 Mighty Mouse FFAR rockets. A total of 682 D-models were constructed. For some reason, the E,F,G models were propsed but skipped, and an upgrade to the F-89H happened in 1956. The final variant was the F-89J, and it was provided with two underwing pylons capable of carrying the nuclear Genie rocket. By the end of 1969, all Scorpions were retired in US service.\nlength: 16.40 m\nwingspan: 18.20 m\nmax. takeoff weight: 19.2 metric tons\npowerplant: 2x Allison J-35 turbojets with afterburners for 7200 lbf\nmaximum speed: 635 mph\nservice ceiling: 15,000 m\narmament: 104 70 mm might Mouse rockets\nAll of the above assuming someone on Wikipedia did his homework correctly\nLet's start off with the mandatory sprue shots:\nAs you can see, the kit comes with some nice recessed panellines, and some details in the wheelbays as well. This comes at the price of some sinkmarks left and right, but for a Revell molding from 1991, I'm completely happy.\nI'll be building the D-version, as in my mind there's no choice to be made when you have those wingtip rocket pods! And so, we'll be doing the version from the boxart. I bought myself some of the AK Extreme metal paints the other day and the natural metal part of this bird will be done with those. It'll be interesting to see if I can get a good a result as Phil did.\nAs usual, the cockpit is the first to be tackled. Two seats of 4 parts each are easily constructed, and the rest of the cockpit parts released from the sprue. No details whatsoever for the instrument panels or side panels, but since revell provide decals there, I'm gla they didn't bother. Saves me the trouble of sanding off the lot of it....\nNext up: gluing up the rocketpods and fueltanks. Seams were filled with some filler, and are awaiting sanding.\nAnd that's pretty much it for a first update. The next update should have paint.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.thedefensepost.com/2022/09/30/usaf-drones-ai-gun-detection/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-23T23:26:21&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296818835.29/warc/CC-MAIN-20240423223805-20240424013805-00053.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9124184250831604,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.912418&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:517,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;517&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__13078619&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;US Air Force AFWERX has awarded ZeroEyes a contract to deliver its AI gun detection solution for the service’s unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at the Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\nThe $1.25 million Direct-to-Phase II SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grant is the third contract the air force has awarded to the firm this year.\nZeroEyes’ technology will enable UAVs to detect handheld weapons for base protection.\nThe detection system is programmed with machine learning software with internet protocol security cameras that “identify the gun before the first shot is fired.”\nAfter identification, the system shares screenshots of threats. An operator at a control facility confirms the weapon and triggers the drones to activate its response and interference components.\nThe entire process of AI-based gun detection takes three to five seconds, according to the firm.\n“A quarter of active shootings take place on government property, and we will take every step possible to protect our Airmen,” Dover Air Force Base Chief innovation Officer Capt. Nicholas Martini said.\n“ZeroEyes’ technology not only provides another layer of security; it will also enable us to reduce our investment in security personnel and use our manpower for more mission-critical tasks.”\nZeroEyes’ Gun Detection in USAF\nUSAF’s 325th Security Forces Squadron tested the ZeroEyes’ AI detection solution at Tyndall Air Force Base in March.\n“The AI software can identify weapons such as shotguns, rifles and other weapon models,” said 325th Security Forces Squadron Tech and Innovation Officer-in-Charge Staff Sgt. Nicholas Murphy said.\n“This innovation in technology is ‘early warning’ in nature and can help security forces Airmen save seconds that will save lives.”\n“It is fully mission capable and due to that presence, it is a deterrence to stop or mitigate damage. The AI meets our mission intent because these technologies are used to strengthen our multi-layered base defense capability and augment our manpower.”\nOther Contracts from AFWERX\nIn June, the firm received a $750,000 SBIR contract from AFWERX for the research, development, and deployment of the detection software at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.\nOne month later, Zero Eyes secured another $1.2 million contract to integrate the technology at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.farecompare.com/flights/Rio_de_Janeiro-RIO/Resistencia-RES/market.html&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2014-10-25T12:51:34&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2014-42/segments/1414119648155.19/warc/CC-MAIN-20141024030048-00047-ip-10-16-133-185.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.6507619619369507,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.650762&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:790,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;790&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2014-42&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2014-42__0__80283326&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cheap Flights from Rio de Janeiro to Resistencia -

The long and short length approximations are matching with the experimental results on their respective domains.\nRadial stresses at the root of the notch Figure 1.\nThe symmetry boundary condition is applied on the lines on left of the plate and the line on the Finite element analysis of a fuselage of the plate and ahead of the crack tip.\nFirstly, we develop a finite element model with detailed material property, ply design, fixture structure, and actuators installation considered. This is essential to accurately capture the high gradients of stress variations near the crack tip. The direction of the crack is defined by selecting the three adjacent left nodes from the crack tip.\nFracture mechanics, combined with the conventional fatigue design modals now became an integral part of mechanical engineering design. In order to improve the dimensional quality and increase the productivity, a new shape control system has been proposed to conduct dimensional shape adjustment before the assembly process.\nFor the initial analysis in the section 1. Thus, plane stress assumption is valid in this case. Substituting these values at the above equation we get,?? Suppose a given plate with a crack, is loaded in tension. There are many commercial tools available for solving the real life problems using FE methods.\nBy using finite element analysis, we conduct the feasibility analysis of this new shape control system. But, the long length approximated equation fail to achieve satisfactory results in this case. The state of stress existing in the portion of the fuselage between the rivet holes is considered to be similar to that of a wide thin plate subjected to uniform stress containing a circular hole in the middle Figure 1.\nThe finite element model is then validated and calibrated by physical experimental data. A new composite fuselage shape control system is proposed. For the verification of its results, the analysis is repeated by varying the length of singular elements.\nThus, it is dangerous to use this equation for design purposes. The condition prevailing in this case is known as plane strain case. Airbus Corporation Due to their criticality, the aircraft fuselages are periodically inspected using NonDestructive Testing NDT methods for any potential flaws.\nSimplified Model of Crack prevalent in relatively thin plates in which there is no considerable variation in displacements along the direction of thickness. The second set is calculated using the approximated equation for a short length crack from section 1.\nFrom the theoretical calculations in section 1. Thus, it can be said that the FE solution is valid. However for a thick plate, material away from the free surfaces is not free to deform laterally as it is constrained by the surrounding material.\nThe tangential stress at any point on the plate is given by,?? The FE analysis can be repeated for different lengths of cracks in order to find out the relationship between the stress intensity factor and the crack length.\nThe condition is mainly Figure 1. From the figure, it is clear that the FEA results are most closely matching the empirical relation based on experimental results. But, the short length equation fails in this case.Finite Element Analysis of a Fuselage Crack.

This replaced an earlier Sector Understanding, agreed in 1987, which used to regulate Export Credit financing.\nUnder the new ASU, OECD member states and, for the first time, Brazil have entered into a gentlemen’s agreement setting out the parameters under which export credit support can be made available for financing civilian aircraft.\nThe ASU applies to financing for new and used aircraft, spare engines and parts, maintenance contracts, conversion contracts and other modification work and engine kits. It does not apply to financing military aircraft or to flight simulators. As with the previous ASU there are separate terms for large and other aircraft.\nFor new aircraft, the main developments include:\n- Specified minimum levels of insurance or guarantee premia that should be charged by the participating Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) for providing cover. These are calculated by reference (amongst other things) to the credit rating of the airline.\n- A discount for premia charged by ECAs to airlines in countries, which have ratified the Cape Town Convention in a satisfactory manner. The maximum permitted discount will also depend on the credit rating of the airline.\n- For large (Category 1) aircraft repayment terms remain at 12 years. For “Category 2 Aircraft”1 terms can be extended to fifteen years, with ten years maximum repayment allowed for smaller aircraft (“Category 3”).\n- For Category 1 aircraft, one or more “risk mitigants” are required for riskier airlines. These include lower than 85 per cent advance rates, 10 rather than 12 year repayment terms and straight line rather than mortgage repayment profile.\n- Financings for all Boeing and Airbus aircraft (other than Category 2 Aircraft) should amortise at least quarterly.\n- Financings for other aircraft will continue to amortise semi-annuall\n- Financings for most aircraft will continue to amortise, either on a straightline or mortgage-style amortisation curve, to zero. However, there is more flexibility for smaller aircraft.\n- Fixed Rate financing is not available for Category 1 aircraft – Pure Cover fixed rates are allowed.\n- ECA-backed support for an aircraft may be put into place at any time within 18 months of its delivery from the manufacturer with the prior agreement of the ECA (but the maximum term of the financing should be calculated from that original delivery date).\n- Any extension of the repayment term by way of sharing of rights in the security on a pari passu basis with the commercial lenders (by way of mismatch or SOAR loans) is no longer permitted.\n- Cover is available for a maximum of 85 per cent of the net price of the aircraft (i.e. net of airframe/engine manufacturer credits), plus the cost of BFE.\n- Fees must be charged on the undrawn amount of any support to which an ECA commits, if the commitment persists for longer than six months.\n- Financing may be made available in Yen.\n- For large aircraft transitional arrangements are in place for existing export contracts notified to the OECD by 30 June 2007 (for deliveries to occur on or before 31 December 2010 in respect of firm contracts concluded no later than 30 April 2007).&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://globalairpower.net/riat-2011-raf-fairford/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2023-10-03T07:25:00&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-40/segments/1695233511055.59/warc/CC-MAIN-20231003060619-20231003090619-00009.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9601411819458008,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.960141&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:756,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;756&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-40&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2023-40__0__184014211&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;report by: Thierry letellier\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of the world famous Royal International Air Tattoo. In 1971, in aid of the Royal Air Forces Association, North Weald hosted the first Air Tattoo. Later, the Tattoo moved onto Greenham Common, and ended up at what is now considered to be the home of the Air Tattoo, RAF Fairford. Themes for this year’s anniversary edition were STAR 11 (Strike, Attack and Reconnaissance), Tiger 50 (to mark the 50th anniversary of the NATO Tiger Association), and of course RIAT’s own 40th Birthday.\nThe Tiger theme was well supported with F-16s from Belgium, Mirage 2000s from France and Tornados from Germany all present, wearing attractive and eye catching colour schemes applied for the official Tiger Meet that was held in France earlier this year. ‘Heavies’ included an RC-135V from the USAF and an E-6 from US NAVY. The Royal Air Force’s latest aircraft, the Airbus A330, was another attraction in this section. Then we had an edgy CASA 295-AEW ; to complete this list , a very rare and discret A-310 from German Air Force.The main attraction for many enthusiasts were an Ukrainian Air Force IL-76 and Su-27. Booked by RIAT ‘for the enthusiasts’ and as part of their 40th Anniversary.\nThe superb RAF Tornado role demonstration, which brought plenty of noise with high speed, low level flying and pyrotechnics. The Red Arrows put on their usual highly slick display before the French Air Force Rafale showed what a fourth generation fighter being flown by a regular Air Force pilot really can do. The Frecce Tricolori put on their typically flamboyant show before the BAe Systems Typhoon put on a stunning display with a full weapons load. Attending the show as operational commitments currently prevent the RAF from displaying the Typhoon, BAe Chief test pilot Mark Bowman was awarded the Steedman Sword for his display.\nThe 40th Anniversary of RIAT was marked by the Old Flying Machine Company’s warbird pair of Spitfire MH434 and P-51D Mustang “Ferocious Frankie”. The significance of this display to the anniversary was the simple fact that MH434 appeared at the very first IAT in 1971. The slow pace continued with the Belgian Air Force Red Devils, RAF Tutor and Tucano and the The Royal Jordanian Falcons, with only the ever impressive RAF Chinook and the Army Air Corps Apache injecting any real life into the display. The ‘Solo Türk’ F-16 and Saudi Hawks, both of which were UK debutants.\nSix Hawker Hunters marked another anniversary, this time the 60th of that particular type, as Team Viper’s four aircraft were joined by the Swiss Hunter Team’s T68 and Jonathan Whaley’s F58A “Miss Demeanour”. When the A-10 took to the skies that it felt like the Air Tattoo had resumed. Thankfully, the USAF West Coast Demonstration Team’s Warthog display was mighty, showing the performance of the aircraft as well as simulating strafing and bombing runs.\nOn both mornings it was raining fairly heavily with a low cloud base which prevented flying getting underway at the advertised time. On Saturday it was not possible for the flying to start until around midday and, with seemingly no flexibility shown, a number of star items were lost from the schedule that day. Despite this weather problem ; i was globaly satisfied by this edition of RIAT.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://apex.aero/articles/raising-seat-awareness-recaros-iseat-collects-data-inform-design/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-21T21:32:06&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296817819.93/warc/CC-MAIN-20240421194551-20240421224551-00703.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9529082775115967,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.952908&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:508,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;508&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__173096605&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Recaro’s iSeat is part of a larger connected ecosystem meant to streamline flight operations and inform the next generation of comfort.\nSeveral of Recaro Aircraft Seating’s sensor-equipped BL3530 iSeats are now in service aboard a TAP Air Portugal Airbus A321 aircraft, marking the first time an “intelligent” seat has made its way into the economy cabin. Besides improving crew efficiency during takeoff and landing and being capable of predictive maintenance, these seats can create a high-level picture of passenger needs – and inform Recaro’s next generation of aircraft seating.\nThe iSeats are indistinguishable on the outside from their less intelligent cousins, but they gather data on passenger behavior, such as when the seat is occupied, and how many times a passenger deploys the tray table, raises the armrests or reclines the seat. They also record whether a seatbelt is fastened, and that a seat is in full upright position. “We believe that a ‘smart’ seat will have the most impact on safety-of-flight operations,” says Dr. Mark Hiller, CEO of Recaro Aircraft Seating. “Passenger comfort such as temperature, recline and cushion pressure is another development we are looking at,” Hiller adds. On long flights, the seat could remind the passenger to stretch or help them get higher-quality rest.\nRecaro’s iSeats were slated for a six-month trial with TAP, which began in September last year, with data pulled on a bimonthly basis. “There are more ideas for further developments and further sensor installation, but we wanted to start with something more basic as a proof of concept and set up a process that then could be utilized for a more extensive array of sensors,” says Nuno Leal, head of Fleet Planning and Contracts at TAP.\nLeal hopes the data culled from the seats will improve the seat development process in the future. “The development of new seats is typically based on subjective ideas and perceptions of comfort and behavior, not on an empirical approach like this one,” he says. “We hope, down the line, this will result in a better seat, more tailor-made to our passengers’ requirements.”\n“Raising Seat Awareness” was originally published in the 10.1 February/March issue of APEX Experience magazine.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.bvm.co.uk/industries-2/transport-solutions/aviation-solutions/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-16T15:31:03&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296817095.3/warc/CC-MAIN-20240416124708-20240416154708-00357.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.8774632811546326,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.877463&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:265,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;265&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__22027376&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Aviation Computer Solutions\nAlthough not supplying safety critical systems, BVM has extensive experience in working in providing custom PC solutions required for the supporting of Aviation related applications.

An example of this is the U.S. Air Force’s T-X advanced jet trainer program, launched in late 2018. The Boeing/Saab T-X fighter jet will train pilots to fly 4th- and 5th-generation jets using the latest cutting-edge technology, including embedded training systems and smart weapons.\nThe Air Force plans to purchase 351 T-X aircraft and 46 simulators, as well as associated ground equipment, with the goal of replacing the venerable T-38C Talon supersonic jet trainer (Figure 1), which has been in service for 50-plus years.\nFigure 1: A T-38C Talon used primarily by Air Education and Training Command for undergraduate pilot and pilot instructor training. Photo: U.S. Air Force/Steve White.\n(Click graphic to zoom)\nThe Air Force also has the option to purchase as many as 475 aircraft and 120 simulators, making this a big moneymaker for Boeing, Saab, and its subcontractors. The first trainer and simulator are expected to arrive in 2023, at which point undergraduate pilots will transition to training on the T-X platform.\n“Cockpit and sensor management are fundamentally different today in 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft than it was when the T-38 was built in 1961,” says Brig. Gen. Dawn Dunlop, the director of plans, programs and requirements at Air Education and Training Command, in an Air Force news release. “While the T-38 has been upgraded to a glass cockpit, the inability to upgrade the T-38’s performance and simulated sensor capability presents a growing challenge each year to effectively teach the critical skills essential to today’s military pilots.”\nAging technology in military systems is arguably the most dangerous of threats. Dunlop’s notes that “12 of 18 advanced pilot training tasks can’t be completed with the T-38, relying on fighter and bomber formal training units to complete the training at a much greater cost.”\n“This new aircraft will provide the advanced training capabilities we need to increase the lethality and effectiveness of future Air Force pilots,” says Heather A. Wilson, secretary of the Air Force, upon the announcement of the T-X program. “Through competition we will save at least $10 billion on the T-X program.”\nBoeing and Saab teamed up to deliver a design that addresses both the aging technology on the T-38C and the cost of constant retrofits and upgrades. Boeing and Saab documents describe the T-X aircraft as sporting one engine, twin tails, stadium seating, and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. (Figure 2.)\nFigure 2: T-X Trainer aircraft.

In the early 1960s, a commercial variant of the engine powered the first Learjets, a family of pioneering private jets for business executives.”\nCollins Aerospace (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), a United Technologies Corp. business unit, will provide the ACES 5 ejection seat that provides pilots with passive head and neck protection. The ACES 5 also has arm- and leg-flail prevention, as well as a load-compensating catapult rocket. Collins will also supply the aircraft’s landing gear system.\nWhile Saab is responsible for the aft fuselage and associated subsystems, it will rely on Triumph Group (Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for design, development, manufacture, and support for the aircraft mounted accessory drives (AMAD) and hydraulic systems.\nFull operational capability for the T-X fleet is expected by 2034.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-07-26/news/0240110197_1_release-transcripts-astronauts-transcript-prepared&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2017-04-27T09:12:21&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2017-17/segments/1492917122041.70/warc/CC-MAIN-20170423031202-00429-ip-10-145-167-34.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9865604043006897,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.98656&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:453,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;453&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2017-17&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2017-17__0__110121393&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CAPE CANAVERAL — NASA will release transcripts of conversations by Challenger astronauts as early as Monday after space agency attorneys give final approval.\nThe conversations, contained on a tape salvaged from cabin debris on the ocean floor, indicate the seven crew members weren't aware of impending danger before the shuttle broke apart 74 seconds into flight, officials have said.\nNASA has definitely decided to release a transcript, which should identify which of the crew members spoke and their comments, said June Stewart, an agency attorney in Washington.\n''A number of top people at headquarters have listened to the tape and compared it with a transcript'' prepared at Johnson Space Center in Houston, she said Friday.\nJim McCulla, a spokesman at NASA headquarters in Washington, said attorneys were still going over the transcript to determine if anything, such as possible expletives, should be deleted.\nRelatives of two crew members said they do not object to the release of transcripts.\n''I guess we wouldn't have any trouble with that,'' said Ellen Jarvis of Orlando, stepmother of payload specialist Greg Jarvis. She said that she and her husband Bruce were not aware the tape had been transcribed.\n''I think it would actually make us feel very relieved if we could hear Greg say something uplifting at a time like that,'' she said. ''Any words he said that indicated he was still happy at that time would make us feel better.''\nMarvin Resnik, father of Judy Resnik, said through a spokesman that he had been told what was on the tape and had no objection to release of a transcript.\nThe space agency announced last week that a preliminary analysis of the damaged tape indicated that the astronauts had made comments that would be considered normal during a launch.\nStudies continued this week, and attorneys in Washington received a transcript Thursday, said Doug Ward, an agency spokesman in Houston. He said technicians also are studying data that was recorded on the tape, but that is not expected to provide any new information.\nThe tape was analyzed by a ''handful'' of astronauts and others in the flight crew operations office, Ward said.\nThe tape had been damaged by salt water and caustic chemicals, but IBM technicians were able to restore it.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:44,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reinforcedplastics.com/content/news/heatcon-improves-process-control-in-composites-repair&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-03-04T07:40:41&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947476432.11/warc/CC-MAIN-20240304065639-20240304095639-00886.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9319270849227905,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.931927&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:384,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;384&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-10&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-10__0__68905607&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The network controller is designed to maintain uniform temperatures as multiple hot bonders are used to repair large areas of composite parts.\n“With large-area repairs, the difficulty in maintaining uniform temperature increases thermal characteristics of the part as well as the limitations of large heat blankets,\&quot; explains HEATCON President Eric Casterline.\n\&quot;This has created a unique need for the network controller in the composites market.”\nHot bonders, heat blankets and other equipment from Seattle, USA, based HEATCON are used to repair composite aircraft components that require bonding processes. The network controller was designed to address advanced repair designs required for the newest airplanes and helicopters. The increased use of composites for commercial airlines has created a need for equipment to address the challenge of ensuring proper cure cycles over large repair areas, which supports processes from manufacturers and regulatory agencies as they become approved.\nThe geometrically complex shapes in the newest aircraft, which use increasing amounts of composite materials, will require more sophisticated repairs. Many of these advanced repair techniques can be better addressed using the network controller, HEATCON says.\n“Substructure under a laminate surface can act as a heat sink, increasing the possibility of non-uniform temperature cures,” Casterline reports.\n“The network controller has the capability of addressing advanced repair designs required for the latest aircraft. It allows coordination of a number of repair zones and has the ability to handle complex and demanding repair scenarios.”\nUsing a single bonder to fix large areas of a composite part makes it difficult to control the temperature throughout the entire repair area. A typical bonder managing two repair zones may not provide sufficient coverage for controlling critical temperatures throughout the entire repair area.\nConnecting several bonders to the new network controller lets technicians provide uniform temperatures, which improves the integrity of the part being repaired, HEATCON reports.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://helihub.com/2018/10/03/lebanon-orders-6-md530gs/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-05-20T18:25:10&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-22/segments/1558232256100.64/warc/CC-MAIN-20190520182057-20190520204057-00410.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.890395998954773,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.890396&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1002,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,002&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2019-22&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2019-22__0__94327722&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;MD Helicopters, Inc.

After separating from the Soyuz third stage, the Fregat main engine was expected to fire three times to maneuver the Meridian M spacecraft into an elliptical, or egg-shaped, orbit ranging between roughly 600 and 25,000 miles (about 1,000 kilometers by 39,700 kilometers) above Earth, with an inclination of 62.8 degrees to the equator.\nThe launch was delayed from Jan. 24 due to an electrical problem detected in the Soyuz rocket’s third stage. Russian teams elected to replace the third stage with a new unit, pushing back the launch date by nearly a month.\nAccording to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Fregat upper stage deployed the Meridian M satellite into its targeted orbit, and ground teams from the Russian Aerospace Forces took control of the new spacecraft.\nThe defense ministry said Thursday ground controllers established a stable communications link with the satellite, and systems on-board the spacecraft are functioning normally.\nThe Meridian spacecraft are manufactured by ISS Reshetnev, a Russian space contractor, as replacements for a previous generation of Molniya communications satellites. The Russian contractor says the Meridian satellites weigh around 2.1 metric tons, or 4,630 pounds, and can operate for at least seven years in space.\nThanks to their elliptical orbits, Meridian satellites can link Russian ground forces, aircraft, ships and command centers in the Arctic, Siberia and the North Sea, outside the reach of stable communications coverage through geostationary satellites over the equator.\nIn one example of the Meridian fleet’s communications mission, the Russian Defense Ministry said the satellites relay signals between coastal stations and vessels and ice reconnaissance airplanes traveling along the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic Ocean.\nWith Thursday’s mission, Russia has launched nine Meridian communications satellites since 2006 to begin replacing the Molniya family of data relay platforms. One of the Meridian satellites was lost in a Soyuz launch failure in 2011, and another was released into an off-target orbit in 2009.\nThursday’s launch sent the second upgraded Meridian M-class spacecraft into orbit. The first of the new batch of Meridian M satellites launched in July 2019.\nThe Meridian satellites are a part of Russia’s Integrated Satellite Communications System, working with the Russian military’s Raduga, or Globus, military data relay satellites in geostationary orbit.\nEmail the author.\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.liligo.com/cheap-flights-to-mexico-city-from-dublin&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2023-03-24T07:00:47&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-14/segments/1679296945248.28/warc/CC-MAIN-20230324051147-20230324081147-00514.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.8584879040718079,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.858488&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:194,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;194&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-14&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2023-14__0__10054959&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Availability of fares is not guaranteed for offers found in the last 7 days.\nFind the cheapest Dublin Mexico City flight by browsing the dates below to find alternative flight prices found in the last days.

They helm a fleet of three Robinson R44 helicopters, as well as R22 whirlybirds, each spacious enough for up to three guests. Along the way, skybound guests peep at the area's arterial highways, majestic mountains, and winding Chattahoochee River, intermittently soaring high enough to fly over skyscrapers while avoiding most feral clouds.\nPilots also instill basics of takeoff, steering, and landing during flight-training programs that start students off on the cloud-kicking path to obtaining private, commercial, and flight-instructor licenses. When not leading tours and training programs, the skywaymen shuttle passengers between airports and hotels and take aerial photographers up for photo shoots.\nHumans dreamed of achieving flight for millennia, driven by the desire to find out what clouds taste like (a lot like fog, it turns out). Take to the skies with today's Groupon. For $40 per person, you get a quarter-hour private helicopter tour from Whirl Helicopter Atlanta, a $79 value. Depart from McCollum Airport in Kennesaw and fly to Kennesaw Mountain and over Marietta Square and the Big Chicken.\nThe 3,600-second Discovery Flight sits you side by side with one of the school's certified flight instructors in a Robinson R22 helicopter. After a brief ground school that covers the basics, you'll strap into the cockpit of this reliable, safe little bird and cover essential preflight principles such as breathing and not making eye contact for more than three seconds. Listen to the purr of the engine that's won the R22 major-speed and distance-performance records, while your steady hands maintain hovering level. From there you'll try a short flight around the area, with the instructor offering helpful guidance along the way.\nThe male and female firearm experts of American Home Defense shape their shooting and self-defense classes around legal regulations with an emphasis on personal safety. In private shooting lessons, students learn to handle three of the most common handguns and home-defense classes equip participants with the know-how to protect their families from intruders or a neighbor's moat monster.\nThe FAA–certified instructors at Wesson Aviation instill safe-flying habits in budding aviators, whether their aim is to casually jaunt through the clouds or to pursue a license for flying a plane, helicopter, or really large, specially folded piece of paper. No matter their aerial pursuit, pilots learn on modern and well-maintained equipment. The Bell Jet Ranger helicopter has flown about 1,400 hours and spoils students with modern avionic equipment, such as a Garmin GPS, radar altimeter, and heating and air conditioning—creature comforts to revel in when playing long hide-and-seek games with a stealth bomber. Students can also work toward their FAA pilot certification for private, commercial, or instructor flight at more than 200 miles per hour aboard the outfit’s twin-engine Beechcraft Baron airplane.:\nRon Carroll's fascination with helicopters began in Vietnam, when the aircraft transported him and his fellow infantry through the jungles to the front lines. Two Purple Hearts, nearly 20 years, and a stint in the publishing industry later, Carroll happened upon a copy of Flying magazine and his interest quickly rekindled. He continued with flying lessons, deepening his desire to become a helicopter pilot.\nToday, Carroll possesses a Gold Seal CFI certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and helms a team of three pilots with more than 25,000 combined hours of flight experience. With a fleet comprising Robinson R22 and R44 helicopters?as well as a TruFlite H flight simulator that lets aspiring pilots practice operating a helicopter while singing and without leaving the ground?the team has trained throngs of airmen, including Governor Sonny Perdue.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:53,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://newsbk.com/news/u-s/the-latest-us-russia-astronauts-making-emergency-landing.1a/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2018-10-17T05:44:22&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-43/segments/1539583510998.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20181017044446-20181017065946-00137.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9366199970245361,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.93662&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:743,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;743&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2018-43&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2018-43__0__146195582&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;US, Russia astronauts making emergency landing\n5 days ago - By WBALTV\nTwo astronauts from the U.S. and Russia are making an emergency landing after a Russian booster rocket carrying them into orbit to the International Space Station has failed after launch.\nRead more ...\nThe Latest: NASA says 2 astronauts in good condition\n5 days ago - By National Post\nBAIKONUR, Kazakhstan - The Latest on the failed space launch carrying two astronauts :\nNASA says that two astronauts from the U.S. and Russia are in good condition after an emergency landing following booster rocket failure minutes after the launch.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos' Alexei Ovchinin lifted off as scheduled at 2:40 p.m. Thursday from the Russia-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a Soyuz booster rocket.\nThey were to dock at the International Space Station six hours later, but the booster suffered engine failure minutes after the launch.\nRead more ...\nThe Latest: US, Russia astronauts making emergency landing\n5 days ago - By Miami Herald\nThe Latest on the failed space launch carrying two astronauts : 3 p.m. Two astronauts from the U.S. and Russia are making an emergency landing after a Russian...\nRead more ...\nThe headlines of News BreaK\nCanada is now the world's largest legal marijuana marketplace\nCanadian leaders say the goal is to better reflect society's changing opinion about marijuana and bring black market operators into a regulated system.\nBradley's grand slam helps Red Sox beat Astros 8-2 in ALCS\nThe Boston Red Sox take a 2-1 lead in the AL Championship Series against the Houston Astros.\nRed Sox bash host Astros to capture Game 3 of the ALCS\nHOUSTON - These Red Sox seem to treat imposing road locales with the same laissez-faire attitude that Rocky Balboa treated Russia when he took on Ivan Drago.

Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the public-use flight. The helicopter was substantially damaged and the commercial-rated pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor injuries. The flight originated about 5 minutes earlier. Use your browsers 'back' function to return to synopsisReturn to Query Page\nThe pilot stated that the first flight departed at 1915, to spray chemical for mosquitoes but returned due to plugged spray nozzles that he noted midpoint of the second spray pass. Without securing the engine, the plugged nozzles were replaced and the flight departed to again spray chemical. After takeoff while flying about 200-250 feet above ground level (agl) at an indicated airspeed of 30-40 knots, with a 10-15 knot wind from the southeast, he began a left turn to line up for his spray swath. The helicopter yawed 20-30 degrees to the right which could not be corrected with full left anti-torque pedal input.

Surprisingly, the pilot walked (probably limped) away.\nAt 20 feet or so while landing, a quick downward gust started folding down the right half of his wing. Momentum and relative wind did the rest, quickly collapsing 70% of his paraglider. All that fabric, now presenting a vertical wall of drag, caused an immediate turn that was aggravated by lift from the open left side. The highly experienced pilot didn’t know what happened until a turn began. Then it was way too late.\nIt took less than one second from the pilots first feel of trouble to be in an unrecoverable situation. Lest anyone think otherwise, realize that it takes the human brain at least one second just to register a strange sensation. The only way out of this was prevention.\nAnother 20 feet higher and it would have been much worse. Another 100 feet higher and it would have been recoverable.\nIt appears he felt something because, although on landing approach, he lifted his legs just before the collapse started. Also, it looks like the wing surged forward somewhat. The most likely scenario is that he flew from the rising air of a thermal into a downward swirl on the other side. That jibes with reports from the pilot and witnesses. See sidebar on the thermal theory. One witness said the pilot reported a blast of warm air just before it happened. Wake turbulence (see sidebar) is a possibility that appears far less likely.\n(Above) Frame A through C show a normal, power off approach. Frame D shows him bring his legs up but the wing hasn’t felt anything yet. Frame E reveals the leading edge just starting to be blown down slightly right of center. In Frame F the slipstream is now pushing the wing downward and causing a significant collapse. Notice the pilot is still essentially level and in the same position he has been throughout. His fate is sealed yet he is only aware that something is amiss. From frame E to F is about a half-second. He has just started to turn right in frame G and, at this point, is essentially a passenger. The only out was preventing entry.\nKeep in mind, we’re analyzing what took 3 seconds to finish.\nIt seems the wing surged forward, making it more susceptible to collapse and this hit a bit of downward gust. Dampening that surge could have certainly helped but it may not have been enough. When off power and in turbulence, it’s a good idea to try keeping brake pressure 2 or so (about 1/4 brakes). I suspect this pilot, with his experience did damp it slightly.\nThanks to Steve for sharing the video, James for helping with information and Brent for his perspective.\nAn experienced paramotor pilot who saw it happen offered his thoughts:\nIt was around noon. And he was flying over the field trying to get down a couple times before. He said he could feel heat rising off the ground. Just before he crashed he was over the black top taxi way.\nSo the hot sun could have contributed to it for sure. I had just arrived at the field when it happened and I was just off to the right of the camera. Paul’s brother Steve shot the video of the crash. I shot Ivan later and made the video.\nAnother flyer and eyewitness offers:\nIt was around 11:00 or so…He was flying on the downwind side of the runway. After talking to him, he said that just before the wing gave way he had a blast of warm air hit is face.\nIf you look at the airport diagram below he was east of runway 12/30. Also there are trees to the west and south at 30′ to 60′ feet. With the wind coming over these trees, the heat of the runway, the building to the east of that, (Look at the top picture of the website), something could happen. He was the only one flying at the time, too.\nFlying within three hours of sunrise and sunset, and only during forecast mellow conditions is the best prevention. Some pilots, especially free flyers who are used to stronger conditions, will take on the mid-day risk knowingly. Sometimes they get burned.\nWinds appear to have been fairly light. If you walked outside and checked, you have considered it nice. Wunderground historical data showed it to be light that Sept 22 noontime. See the charts at right for a temperature graph. Thanks to Terry Lutke for the weather information.\nSkill and choice of equipment also has an effect on susceptibility. For example, being heavy on a wing reduces the likelihood of a collapse at some increase in severity. Your choice of a wing affects it, too. A fast, high performance wing is more susceptible than a beginner wing although it can happen to anything—if the air is going down faster than the wing can handle, the leading edge will react this way. A reflex wing, flown in its most resistant configuration, may handle it better, too. Reflex wings don’t fold under as easily although they certainly can and you better know what configurations are susceptible.\nOnce aloft, a pilot can reduce his chances of this fate by those suggestions covered under Handling Wing Collapses. Essentially keep brake pressure 2 applied, especially with the power off. Fly actively if you’ve already developed that skill, otherwise, now is not the time to learn it. Using just the right brake inputs to keep the wing overhead (active flying) is a skill that takes many hours to master and pilots who don’t fly regularly in moderately bumpy air never acquire it. Strong turbulence is not the place to learn since inappropriate inputs are worse than just holding pressure 2 and letting your hands float with that pressure.\nVideo of Collapse and Crash\nSome interesting points. Notice the video’s time counter. It’s basically over in two seconds. Ivan is one tough bird! The windsock and other pilot input suggests that winds at the time were relatively light (see sidebar on Weather at the Time).&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/22/mars_express_orbiter_upgrade/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-19T15:52:05&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296817438.43/warc/CC-MAIN-20240419141145-20240419171145-00132.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9558039307594299,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.955804&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1013,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,013&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__162806281&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This article is more than 1 year old\nMars Express orbiter to get code update after 19 years\nAnd over millions of miles, too. Piece of cake!?\nThe software on ESA's Mars Express spacecraft is to be upgraded after nearly two decades, giving the orbiter capabilities to hunt for water beneath the planet and study its larger moon, Phobos.\nMars Express was launched on June 2, 2003, and was initially made up of two components: the Mars Express Orbiter and the Beagle 2 lander. Unfortunately, the lander failed to make contact with Earth after it was released and arrived at the surface of the Red Planet. It is presumed lost. The orbiter, however, is still working after 19 years in service, spinning around Mars.\nNow, engineers at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF), Italy, are revamping the spacecraft's software. The upgrade will allow the Mars Express Orbiter to continue searching for water locked beneath the Martian surface using its MARSIS radio-wave instrument and monitor the planet's closest satellite, Phobos, more efficiently. MARSIS is today operated by INAF and funded by the Italian Space Agency.\nSpecifically, according to ESA, the orbiter, which is millions of miles from Earth, will receive \&quot;a series of upgrades that improve signal reception and on-board data processing to increase the amount and quality of science data sent to Earth.\&quot; It appears part of the update will streamline its processes and communications to reduce the information collected by the onboard sensors to just what's needed.\n\&quot;Previously, to study the most important features on Mars, and to study its moon Phobos at all, we relied on a complex technique that stored a lot of high-resolution data and filled up the instrument's on-board memory very quickly,\&quot; Andrea Cicchetti, the MARSIS deputy principal investigator and operation manager at INAF, leading the upgrade, explained in a statement.\n\&quot;By discarding data that we don't need, the new software allows us to switch MARSIS on for five times as long and explore a much larger area with each pass.\&quot;\nMars Express will thus continue to look for signs of water near the Martian South Pole at high resolutions. Colin Wilson, a scientist working on the mission, said the software was \&quot;like having a brand-new instrument on board…almost 20 years after launch.\&quot;\n\&quot;The MARSIS radar on-board software upgrade demonstrates that it is possible to renew an entire mission,\&quot; Cicchetti told The Register in a statement.\n\&quot;I am not surprised at all that such a mission is still in flight after 19 years. I [have been] working on it every day since its launch, and I am sure that Mars Express will give us the possibility to make many other discoveries in the coming years that will help us to better understand our planet.\&quot;\n- Surviving eclipse season and resurrecting 25-year-old software with Windows for Workgroups 3.11: One year with Mars Express\n- Voyager 2 is back online after eight months of radio silence\n- Humanity uploaded an AI to Mars and lets it shoot rocks with lasers\n- Australia down for scheduled maintenance: No talking to Voyager 2 for 11 months\nMars Express was ESA's first planetary mission, and is the second oldest active spacecraft orbiting a planet other than Earth. The oldest is NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey. Pushing new software to such an old orbiter after so long is challenging, according to Carlo Nenna, an engineer at Enginium, an Italian IT consulting firm helping to roll out the upgrade.\n\&quot;We faced a number of challenges to improve the performance of MARSIS,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Not least because the MARSIS software was originally designed over 20 years ago, using a development environment based on Microsoft Windows 98!\&quot;\n\&quot;The very old development environment (it was quite old already back in year 2000) required to set up a Windows 98 machine. I did this with a virtual machine in VirtualBox,\&quot; he told The Register.\n\&quot;Just finding a way to share files between host and guest machines was an hard task. Installing common things like a working web browser or a source code editor was difficult too. It took almost two months only to set up and fully validate the development environment.\&quot;\nThe spacecraft carries seven instruments, including various cameras, spectrometers, and a radar altimeter to study Mars's atmosphere, climate, and geology. Mars Express was the first to spot signs of water ice and carbon dioxide ice on the planet, leading scientists to question whether it could have been habitable at some point. It also collected data that hinted at signs of methane, possibly forged in the hot furnace of volcanoes long ago.\nFinally, the spacecraft orbiter has provided astronomers with some of the most detailed images of Phobos. The Martian moon is shaped like a potato, with an uneven, pockmarked surface unlike the Earth's round Moon. ®&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:66,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/cowling.html&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-04-15T06:55:19&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296816942.33/warc/CC-MAIN-20240415045222-20240415075222-00346.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9485865831375122,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.948587&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:275,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;275&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-18__0__19762692&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;NACA cowling on a Curtis AT-5A at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Oct 1928.\nA cowling is a removable metal covering that houses the engine and sometimes also a portion of the fuselage of an aircraft that is powered by a radial engine. It enables the aircraft to fly more efficiently because it reduces the amount of drag it creates.\nThe NACA low-drag engine cowling was invented by Fred Weick, an engineer from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, in 1928. The test aircraft for this cowling, a Curtis Hawk AT-5A biplane (see photo), featuring a Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine, reached an airspeed of 220 kilometers pe hour fitted with the NACA cowling compared to 190 kilometers per hour without it.\nThe NACA cowling directs cool air to flow onto the center of the motor, where it is routed across the motor's hottest parts, i.e. the cylinders and cylinder heads. Moreover, turbulence after the air passes the free-standing cylinders is greatly reduced. The sum of all these effects reduces drag by as much as 60%.\nThe test conclusions resulted in almost every radial-engined aircraft being equipped with this cowling, starting in 1932. Cowlings are sometimes also used to enclose landing gear.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:67,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.aviatorsmaldives.com/career-guidance-1&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2024-02-24T08:54:51&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474526.76/warc/CC-MAIN-20240224080616-20240224110616-00482.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9664393067359924,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.966439&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1546,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,546&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-10&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2024-10__0__26866907&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Become an Airline Pilot\nGuidance for students wanting to become an airline pilot.\nWhen can you start flying airplanes?\nYou can fly airplanes with an instructor as early as you wish to. You can learn to fly and carry out solo flights by the age of 16 and you can earn your private pilot license by age 17.\nWhat are the educational qualifications required to become a pilot?\nYou can earn your pilot license from variety of institutions ranging from small flying clubs, flight schools to universities and the entry requirements will vary from one another. Most flying clubs and flight schools require you to have completed high school grade academics with passes in subjects like English, Math's and Physics. As Maldivian students passes in O level would be sufficient for you to get enrolled in the flight schools. Colleges and universities tend to have higher educational qualification requirements with higher pass grades requirements and may require A level to be completed specially if you are considering to get a degree along with your pilot license. Some institutions also would require you to pass an entrance exam.\nIs it essential to get a degree?\nIt is an old long debate over whether students should attain degrees or just complete flight training and acquire the pilot license only. The advantages of attaining an aviation degree is that you would have learned a lot more in dept knowledge of the industry and it would help in your career down the line specially if you consider to become part of training or in management roles. However as a pilot with career experience you can become instructors, chiefs, and etc without having degrees as experience and on the job performance is a key element in your progress in airlines. Countries in Europe and other countries where pilot jobs are scarce; most of the students earn degrees along with their pilot license to boost their opportunities in gaining pilot jobs. There are larger airlines that require pilots to have a degree however most of the airlines would hire pilots if they have sufficient experience on the job even though they don't have degrees.\nIn Maldives almost all of the pilots acquire pilot license only and there are only a few who earn degrees. As a student pilots you can finish your pilot training and you can be employed as a pilot and can acquire work experience and progress closer to career advancements by the time students who study for degrees can finish their training's as to complete a degree it would require 3-4 years.\nWhat is PPL, CPL and ATPL?\nPPL : It is a Private Pilot License and it allows the pilot to be the pilot in command of an aircraft privately.\nCPL : It is a Commercial Pilot License and it allows the pilot to fly and engage in commercial flight operations.\nATPL: It is an Airline Transport Pilot License and it allows the pilot to act as a commander of an aircraft. Frozen ATPL is earned when the student pilot have completed all the theoretical examinations but has not yet met the flight hour requirement to obtain ATPL. As the hour requirement is high for this license, the fight hours required are gained working as a pilot in an airline or building hours as a flight instructor.\nIn the Maldives if you hold a CPL license you can be employed to fly as a seaplane pilot. For the captaincy requirement in the seaplane you must obtain an ATPL. In order to be employed to fly heavier turbo prop aircraft like the Dash-8 and the ATR you would require to hold a frozen ATPL license as a minimum.\nIt is highly advisable today to complete frozen ATPL during your flight training as majority of all students study for this and it would aid in earning yourself a job in seaplanes or in wheel based airline. If you have CPL only it would limit your employment options only to seaplane pilot jobs and it would be of a challenge to complete all theoretical examinations required for the ATPL while working as a full time pilot.\nWhat is a type rating?\nA type rating is a regulating agency's certification of a pilot to fly a certain aircraft type that requires additional training. As student pilots after completion of your training and after employment within an airline you would complete the type rating course for the type of aircraft you would fly. Seaplane type ratings are carried out in Maldives where as Dash8, ATR and Airbus type ratings are carried out in foreign countries.\nWhat is the difference between different flight schools?\nAs student pilots you would be obtaining the same pilot licenses issued by the civil aviation authority regardless of the flight school or the university that you attend. Flight schools and universities with higher tuition fees can offer you with the options to fly more advanced training aircraft with glass cockpits. They may have advanced flight simulators for instrument training's and provide you with an overall higher standard of education. Nonetheless you would be studying using the same books and sitting for the same exams and completing your aircraft training as per the regulation from the civil aviation authority regardless of your choice of flight school or university.\nHow long does flight training lasts?\nOn average for the completion of the full pilot course with frozen ATPL would take one year half to two years time. Overall completion of the course depends on various factors like individual student performances and weather and etc.\nStudent performance: The course progression depends a lot on the individuals students performance and the capability to complete all required theoretical exams in given time and complete all the aircraft flying requirements.\nWeather: Students would only be allowed to train in fair weather conditions specially if it is for solo flights. Bad weather days with high winds, heavy rain or snow may delay your training as you would not be able to fly during these periods.\nAircraft: Some of the flight schools have limited aircraft available and maintenance and technical issues are part of day to day operations and that can delay your training flights.\nHow much does flight training cost?\nTuition fee would generally be around 50,000$ to 70,000$+ depending on the flight school of choice. Total expenditure would vary from the country you have chosen to study as students have to bare for travel costs, living costs, visa and etc apart from the tuition fee.\nHow can i fund for pilot training?\nif you does not have the capability to self fund for the pilot course you can opt to obtain student pilot loans.\nMinistry of higher education of Maldives offers pilot training opportunities for students as part of loans and scholarships programs for students. They provide the opportunity for 5 - 20 students each time. You can apply for the loan and if you are selected they would provide student loan for pilot course at countries where they allow students to attain training. You can also get yourself a student loan directly from Bank of Maldives if you meet the requirement criteria for the student loan eligibility.\nWhat are the medical requirements?\nBeing an airline pilot is often considered among the most stressful jobs in the world so your health is a very important factor for a long prosperous career. In order to legally operate as an airline pilot in the Maldives you are required to hold a Class 1 medical license. As student pilots you will have to obtain an aviation medical license from the issuing authority of the country of the flight school you have enrolled before you can commence your flight training.\nGenerally in medical licenses checks they would be conducting an eye test ( sight tests, color vision tests ), Hearing tests, Electrocardiogram tests (to check the functioning of your heart muscle), blood tests, urine tests, and general physique.\nIf you have a condition that you think that may affect your medical license you can get advise from an aviation medical doctor active in hospitals and clinics in Maldives. Aviation medical doctors are present in Male' and in Addu.&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://traveledearth.com/2013/01/07/up-up-and-away-hot-air-ballooning-in-cappadocia/&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-24T11:08:36&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704590423/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516114310-00089-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;language_score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9255546927452087,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.925555&quot;},&quot;token_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:138,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;138&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;global_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;webtext-fineweb__CC-MAIN-2013-20__0__28622875&quot;},&quot;lang&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;en&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;With our 10-year anniversary fast approaching, we decided to celebrate with a huge splurge on a sunrise hot air balloon ride in Göreme, Cappadocia. At 100 Euros (~$130 CAD) per person for an hour-long flight, it made for the single most expensive day of our travels (not counting international flights or the day we bought our house, that is). Even for frugal travelers like ourselves, it was honestly worth every single penny. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do and, for me, ranks as one of the best experiences of our journey.\nI’ll let the pictures speak for themselves:&quot;},&quot;domain&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;aerospace&quot;},&quot;round&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:1646140,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODc5NSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL20tYS1wL0ZpbmVGaW5lV2ViIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTIyMzk1LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.3NPqFTX7uVxnfV7kR_KEvaR52THLMU8dj_e0v2yMrguqCPHuY0PlKCzssFQLXQSJ_wDV0lZA9N0BHFQ0atQ8Ag&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;m-a-p/FineFineWeb&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63839e9962badff4326cf360/k4Q7R4XLDMp_1VF4C6GEd.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Multimodal Art Projection&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;m-a-p&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:673},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

F/A-18 for sure
Nice! I like the B757-200 because it handles well and is perfect for buttered landings
I’ve got a few, Fokker 50, 757, Ta 183, and probably some more the like the MDogs for example
Definitely the 737 Max.
Quite a few: 747, 737-200, B-52, C-5A/B/C
I haven’t flown this IRL or in sim, but this is my favorite aircraft. It’s so beautiful
@PlanesAndGames I see that thumbs down
It looks beautiful!
Eww no! #BoeingDominatesAirbus
Love the a220 tho
Yes Airbus superior BUT not the A220, or should I call it the CSeries, because that’s Bombardier and it’s called the A220 only after Airbus bought the program.
In short, it’s nothing close to other real Airbus planes in terms of ‘quality’.
well u see thats where ur wrong
Also @Maverick I’m pretty sure it’s not Airbus who manufactures the F/A-18…
How is Airbus better than Boeing? Name 10 things that’s better than Boeing
I definitely know Boeing has amazing characteristics, Airbus has clean cockpit and fly-by-wire which I don’t really care. I still like Boeing more #Boeingbetterby3x</span></div></div>

UST is delighted to welcome FlyingBasket on board as a supplier partner, and we will be highlighting their unique solutions and capabilities across our channels over the next 12 months.
We’ve just launched FlyingBasket’s UST supplier profile, which has been written and built by our team in collaboration with the company. The Gold profile showcases the FB3, a heavy-payload cargo drone that provides an unparalleled combination of carrying capacity and compact size.
Read on to find out more:
The FB3 is an all-electric multirotor platform that requires no disassembly and can be easily transported inside a van or trailer, ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. The versatile UAS has been designed to be BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight)-ready, with a robust data link that transmits critical flight control data and telemetry at ranges of up to 10 km. All frequency bands have been specifically configured to minimize interference, and are ECO (European Communications Office)-approved.
The highly adaptable heavy-lift drone delivers exceptional strength, with the ability to lift 100 kg of payload while weighing only 70 kg. It can be provided in one of two configurations, allowing users to carry and transport payloads of all shapes and sizes:
Sling Configuration: use a proprietary remote-controlled load hook to lift and detach heavy cargo
Cargo Compartment: a rugged transportation box measuring 81 x 35 x 30 cm, designed to suit a wide range of payloads and operational requirements
The FB3 features eight brushless motors configured in a coaxial quadcopter setup. This innovative design divides propulsion into top and bottom subsystems, providing critical redundancy for the utmost in safety while ensuring superior heavy-lift performance.
Thanks to FlyingBasket’s custom-made smart batteries, the FB3 is an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative to helicopters and combustion engine-powered aircraft for mission-critical cargo deployment, providing a minimal environmental footprint.
The FB3 has been designed from the ground up with safety foremost in mind. The aircraft includes a comprehensive suite of cutting-edge features to ensure peace of mind and mission confidence even in the most challenging of environments, including a Flight Termination System (FTS), optional ADS-B receiver, and radar AGL sensor.
FlyingBasket also offers a range of comprehensive professional training programs for drone pilots and team members.

It is important to know at any age!
It is true that even our most powerful telescopes aimed at the landing sites wouldn't see anything. However, not because the Moon landings didn't happen. It is only because of the optical limitations of telescopes themselves, because of their limited size and distance from the Moon.
and here is another
The outer Solar System is more richly endowed with moons than the inner regions. The two enormous gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, have numerous moons of various sizes, shapes, and origins. As these enormous planets grew, during the early days of our Solar System, they were able to ensnare wandering objects with their mighty gravitational grips.
Planetary scientists believed for years that Earth's Moon is depleted of water and other volatile compounds. However, this idea began to change in 2008, when a team of scientists announced that they had detected traces of water in some of the volcanic glass beads carried back to Earth from the Apollo 15 and 17 missions to the Moon. In 2011, additional study of extremely small crystalline formations within those beads revealed that they contain amounts of water that are similar to some basalts on Earth. This indicates that the lunar mantle--at least, part of it--contains as much water as Earth's.

There are ongoing studies assessing the past habitability potential of the Red Planet, as well as the possibility of life.
The research published in the July 4, 2016 issue of Nature Geoscience highlights the main factor differentiating moon-birth around Mars and Earth: the differing rotation speeds of the two planets prompted "completely different tidal actions," Dr. Charnoz explained in the July 4, 2016 CNRS Press Release. Dr. Charnoz proposes that at the time of their respective impacts, "Earth took less than four hours to spin on its axis whereas Mars rotated very slowly over a 24-hour period." The result of this important difference caused Earth to hold on to its single, large Moon, while the Martian collision created a dozen smaller moons alongside a larger moon. As time went by, Martian tidal action--resulting from the planet's slow rotation rate--caused most of the moons, including the largest one, to crash back down to the surface of their parent-planet. As a result, only the two most distant moons, Phobos and Deimos, survived as testimony to the ancient catastrophe.
Most of Saturn's natural satellites are very small and icy dancing moonlets. However, the larger, icy midsized moons twirl around their enormous ringed planet in a lovely and mysterious dance. The largest of the icy moons is Rhea, Saturn's second-largest moon after the weird world that is Titan. Iapetus, the third largest of Saturn's moons, is two-faced, with one side composed of gleaming, very bright, highly reflective ice, and the other, dark and non-reflective, a blackened splotch staining the pristine white ice. Iapetus is larger than Mimas and Enceladus. There is an enormous impact crater on the moon Mimas, that stands out as a prominent feature on what is apparently a badly bombarded, heavily cratered world. The large impact crater Herschel on this 400-kilometer moon was excavated by a tumbling chunk of space-stuff made of rock, ice, or both, that came very close to powdering the entire little moon. Another icy moon, Enceladus, is a bewitching world, 500-kilometers in diameter, that is thought to harbor a global subsurface ocean beneath its frozen crust. Where there is liquid water there is always the possibility--though, by no means, the promise--of life. Enceladus also has the highest albedo of any other moon in our Solar System. This means that it has the most dazzlingly bright reflective surface. It also possesses a very active geology, rendering it almost free of craters because it is constantly being resurfaced by the emissions of gushing icy geysers that are responsible for fresh snow that keeps the surface of the little moon sparkling and smooth.</span></div></div>

Universal Robots is a result of many years of intensive research in robotics. The product portfolio includes the UR5 and UR10 models that handle payloads of up to 11.3 lbs. and 22.6 lbs. respectively. The six-axis robot arms weigh as little as 40 lbs. with reach capabilities of up to 51 inches. Repeatability of +/- .004" allows quick precision handling of even microscopically small parts. After initial risk assessment, the collaborative Universal Robots can operate alongside human operators without cumbersome and expensive safety guarding. This makes it simple and easy to move the light-weight robot around the production, addressing the needs of agile manufacturing even within small- and medium sized companies regarding automation as costly and complex. If the robots come into contact with an employee, the built-in force control limits the forces at contact, adhering to the current safety requirements on force and torque limitations. Intuitively programmed by non-technical users, the robot arms go from box to operation in less than an hour, and typically pay for themselves within 195 days. Since the first UR robot entered the market in 2009, the company has seen substantial growth with the robotic arms now being sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.</span></div></div>

Accident occurred Wednesday, August 23, 2000 in NEWBERRYPORT, MA
Probable Cause Approval Date: 04/06/2001
Aircraft: Aviat A-1B, registration: N475C
Injuries: 2 Uninjured.
NTSB investigators may have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.
The pilot reported that he performed a wheel landing with a 90-degree crosswind from the left of about 8 knots. As the tail wheel was being lowered and the flaps raised, the airplane became 'squirrelly'. The pilot added power for a 'go-around', and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. According to the FAA, the airplane departed the runway at a 30-degree angle and continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. Continuous tire tracks from the airplane were observed from the runway to the accident site. A pilot rated passenger reported that he told the front seat pilot to cut the power when the airplane departed the runway. However there was no response, and he closed the throttle before impact.
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during landing and a subsequent rejected landing. Factors were the crosswind, and the delayed corrective action by the pilot. Full narrative available

North American Aerospace Defense Command, better known as NORAD, which was tracking flights in search of Santa Claus, spotted the shuttle immediately after it left the station and followed it to earth, where it was met by F-15 Hornet fighter jets as it entered the atmosphere. The jets escorted the shuttle until it landed.
Officials did not initially approach the craft for fear that some alien life form might have hijacked it. It was only after Bresnik emerged from the shuttle, hailed a taxi and went to his final destination, a Five Guys Restaurant nearby, that they were sure the creature was indeed the missing shuttle astronaut.
Desperate to avoid a scandal, NASA arranged for a secret shuttle launch from Annenberg Air Force Base to get him back to the International Space Station before anyone missed him. The flight from the west coast launch site was later described to the press as a top secret military mission.
Once safely back at the station Bresnik shared his ill-gotten booty with his mates. "The round trip took twenty three hours and cost over $60 million dollars, but it was worth it!." beamed Bresnik. "Those Five Guys, they make some tasty burgers!"</span></div></div>

The 168th Air Refueling Wing operates ten KC-135R Strato Tankers from Eielson AFB, about 20 miles south of Fairbanks. Eielson has been home for the Wing since 1986. Approximately 700 Alaskans serve as members of the unit.
The 168 ARW transfers more fuel than any other Air National Guard (ANG) tanker group, because nearly all receivers are active duty aircraft, many of which are on operational missions. The 168 ARW is the only Arctic-region refueling unit for all of PACAF, and maintains a substantial number of personnel on active duty and civilian technician status in order to meet its daily operational requirements. The Wing's Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) is eight KC-135s.
The mission of the 168th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is to train and equip KC-135R combat crews to provide air refueling in support of PACAF Operations Plans (OPLANS). Our peacetime mission provides air refueling training and exercise support for all 11th Air Force AWACS and fighter aircraft as well as alert tankers and crews to support Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) plans and RC-135X/S reconnaissance (RECCE) refueling requirements. Besides a federally directed mission requirement, as a unit of the Alaska National Guard, the 168 ARW is an asset of the Governor of Alaska. As such, the Governor can direct the unit to respond to emergencies declared or missions required within the State.
The 168 ARW was activated on October 25, 1986 as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS). It traces its lineage to the 437th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), originally activated at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, in June of 1942. Its aircraft were the Martin B-26 "Marauder" and the North American B-25 "Mitchell". The 437th served with distinction in both the European and Pacific theaters of World War Two, earning the French Croix de Guerre (with palm) for action over Italy and France during April-June 1944, two Presidential Unit Citations for operations over Rome and Florence in 1944, and nine combat streamers for campaigns in which it flew. In January of 1945 the 437th was transferred to Okinawa for participation in the Ryuku Islands Campaign and the Air Offensive in Japan, the closing chapters of WWII.
In May of 1946 the 437th was redesignated as the 168th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and allocated to the Illinois Air National Guard. It flew B-26s and was stationed at Chicago's Orchard Place Airport, now O'Hare International Airport. The unit was called to active duty for service in France from 1951-53. In 1954 it was redesignated the 168th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, and flew the famous North American F-51 "Mustang". In 1955 it received the F-84 "Thunderstreak" jet, becoming the 168th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. In 1957 it flew the F-86L "Sabre" jet. In May of 1958, the 168th's aircraft and personnel were assigned to other units, but the 168th's unit designation remained on the state's rolls -- a "technical deactivation". Almost thirty years later, the unit was reactivated as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron and assigned to the Alaska Air National Guard.
From a modest beginning in 1986, the unit has blossomed into full Wing status. Its commitments include providing Alert aircraft in support of NORAD and JCS-directed reconnaissance sorties, mobilization for support of PACAF war plans, and support of worldwide refueling taskings.
The 168 ARW, with an authorized end strength of 700 personnel, has command and control over twelve subordinate assigned units whose missions includes all aircraft maintenance for nine PACAF gained KC-135R model aircraft, providing financial, transportation, contracting, and base supply resources, communications, data processing, and visual information functions, organizational security, disaster preparedness and air base operability, all personnel activities including training, social actions and recruiting, and limited diagnostic and therapeutic service in general medicine, flight medicine, bioenvironmental, environmental, and dental services. Assigned units are the 168th Operations Group (OG), to include the 168th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS) and the 168th Operations Support Flight (OSF); the 168th Logistics Group (LG), to include the 168th Maintenance Squadron (MXS), 168th Aircraft Generation Squadron (AGS), 168th Logistics Squadron (LS) and the 168th Logistics Support Flight (LSF); the 168th Support Group (SPTG), to include the 168th Mission Support Flight (MSF) and the 168th Communications Flight (CF); and the 168th Medical Squadron (MDS).
Because of Alaska's strategic location with regard to national defense, the mission and importance of the 168 ARW and the Alaska Air National Guard should continue to increase in the coming years. The 168 ARW has a remarkably broad range of responsibilities which it fulfills in an exemplary manner, providing an outstanding example for all other Air National Guard units to follow. With a proven capacity to perform, we are ready to face the challenges of the future and are confident of our ability to accomplish any assigned mission.
In January 1994 and again in January 1996, the 168 ARW received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for exceptionally meritorious service both in the Alaskan and Southwest Asian theaters for the periods of January 8, 1991 to January 7, 1993 and January 8, 1993 to June, 1995. This is merely the latest in a long history of achievement throughout the 168th's lineage.
The 168th Air Refueling Wing is the embodiment of teamwork in the new, streamlined American military.
The upper right of the shield consists of a compass rose against a yellow background. The compass rose signifies the global nature of the Wing mission and is set at a 30 degree angle to the east representing the magnetic variation of Alaska where the Group was first formed. The yellow background represents the midnight sun at our latitude and the day aspect of the air refueling mission. The lower left of the shield depicts a red lightning bolt running from cloud to cloud against a blue background. The red lightning bolt signifies the projection of military power, the clouds are the medium in which we perform our mission, and the blue background the Arctic night and the night aspect of our mission. The red lightning bolt is also a prominent feature of the squadron patch from which the 168th Air Refueling Group/Wing evolved. Between the yellow and blue fields is a bar of ultramarine blue containing eight yellow stars. The ultramarine blue is Air Force blue representing our role in the Total Force; it is also the background color of the Alaska flag. The eight yellow stars are the stars of the big dipper also found on the Alaska flag.

UPDATE: This SpaceX Starlink satellite launch is now slated to liftoff from Kennedy Space Center Friday June 26 at 4:18 p.m.
When a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches from Kennedy Space Center Thursday late afternoon, it'll officially push the company's Starlink efforts into the double digits and act as a reminder that multitudes more are still on the way.
Slated for a 4:39 p.m. liftoff from pad 39A, the tenth launch of roughly 60 internet-beaming Starlink satellites will push the constellation's size to nearly 600 in low-Earth orbit. Weather for the 10-minute window is expected to be 40% "go," according to the Space Force.
After liftoff, the rocket's 162-foot first stage will target an automated drone ship landing in the Atlantic Ocean. It should return to Port Canaveral for checkouts and refurbishment a few days later.
Thursday's launch is yet another in SpaceX's 2020 cadence, which to date has produced 10 total launches. If schedules hold, the Space Coast could see at least that many more before the year is out thanks to a combination of Starlink, commercial, and military missions.
With this tenth launch of Starlink, SpaceX appears to be inching ever closer to its goal of opening up broadband services on the ground. Private beta testing is expected to open this summer for users such as early investors, while a public beta should begin this fall for those in the higher latitudes of North America.
To access the constellation, users just need a pizza box-sized, circular antenna known as a ground terminal.
"Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in and point at sky," SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via Twitter last week. "Can be done in either order."
Internet access via satellite isn't new. For decades, various companies, including Microsoft-supported Teledesic in the late 1990s, have attempted to monetize the potential for anyone in any location on Earth to use broadband internet, but most have failed. Some were smaller spacecraft in low orbit, while others have been larger satellites thousands of miles above Earth.
But the distance of those geostationary satellites means the delay between asking for a data transfer and it actually occurring – known as latency – is a real challenge. Measured in milliseconds, the average terrestrial internet user can expect somewhere under 100ms to be sufficient. Most in-home service these days can deliver 50ms or less, according to internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.
One of Starlink's advantages is that its satellites sit roughly 340 miles above Earth, a distance that allows SpaceX to reduce latency. CEO Elon Musk expects current performance at around 20ms.
"It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games," he said last week. "Version 2, which is at lower altitude, could be as low as 8ms latency."
During previous conferences with reporters, Musk has emphasized that SpaceX doesn't need to have tens of thousands of satellites in orbit to start effectively delivering service – it could begin with as few as 1,000. Having more in orbit affords the ability to attract more customers from different regions, as well as improve performance in areas already being served.
In regulatory filings, the company has said it could launch as many as 40,000 of the flat spacecraft, though that remains to be seen. As it stands, SpaceX will likely consistently launch Starlink missions for the foreseeable future.

The Signatories support the European regulatory authorities in producing a robust, harmonised, EU-wide regulatory safety framework that enables the safe, secure, efficient and fair integration of drones in the aviation system, and fosters broad public acceptance. Since the Drones Helsinki Declaration in 2017, which called for simple and performance-based rules for drones, significant progress has been made in developing and delivering a regulatory framework that will support the safe and sustainable growth of the drone industry. However, in order to facilitate the integration of drones in very low-level airspace (i.e. below 500 ft) and preserve the high level of safety in the entire European airspace, we jointly call to accelerate the implementation of the following measures.
1. Extensive public awareness campaign The general public, including recreational/occasional drone users, as well as commercial clients, must be aware of the safety risks, duties, liabilities, insurance requirements, responsibilities and third-party privacy issues associated with drone operations. These are essential requirements as lack of awareness and negligence could result in safety incidents and accidents. Therefore, more resources must be dedicated to this aspect of drone integration in the airspace.
2. Mandatory training and certificate/license relevant to operations The obligation for drone pilots to obtain a certificate or license aligned with EU regulation – depending on the properties, performance and features of the drone – creates awareness and mandates knowledge of the applicable regulations and restrictions as well as helping to develop the necessary skills. Practical training and theoretical knowledge requirements for unmanned aircraft pilots constitute an important safety net to prevent drone incidents or accidents. A solid knowledge and skills base is therefore a must, considering the complexity of the national and European airspaces and related aviation regulations. We are all one in the sky There is only one sky and all stakeholders, new and traditional, need to collaborate to keep it safe, secure, efficient and fair. The Signatories
The undersigned ATM Professional Staff Organisations note with great regret yet another attack of Airlines for Europe (A4E) on the European Air Traffic Management in the form of a joint letter of A4E member airlines’ CEOs to the European Air Navigation Service providers (ANSPs). The letter enumerates a number of ATM-related issues as cause for the delays.
Today, unmanned aircraft are being used among other things for aerial filming and photographing, safety inspections of pipelines or buildings or by farmers. Tests are being performed for delivery of goods or even transport of passengers.
The Aviation Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in December 2015 states: "unmanned aircraft share the same airspace with other aircraft [and therefore] the safety of their operations must remain coherent with the overall aviation safety policy. Finally, unmanned aircraft operations must also be consistent with air traffic rules as laid down in the Common Rules of the Air."
Due to the rapid development of RPAS, the ETF strongly supports the inclusion of RPAS into the scope of the EASA Basic Regulation, as well as other regulatory initiatives aiming to ensure a safe co-existence of manned aircraft and RPAS in line with the principle "one sky – one safety".

ETF CO-SIGNS THE JOINT STAKEHOLDER STATEMENT ON DRONES
The ETF has joined other stakeholders from manned aviation in the call for a robust harmonized EU-wide regulatory safety framework for drones. The signatories also expressed their serious concern about the safety of manned aircraft in controlled and uncontrolled airspace.
At the same time, the ETF expects that all the safety and security aspects of drone operations will be addressed in the current revision of the EASA Basic Regulation.
The Remote Tower technology is advancing rapidly. It is important that regulators, Air Navigation Service Providers and staff engage on the subject to ensure that where remote towers are deployed, they are done so in a way that is safe, measured and with the appropriate consideration for staff. The technology has advanced ahead of proper regulation and a consistent and considered effort is now required by all stakeholders to ensure the appropriate regulatory environment is created. The social consequences need to be properly considered and the arising issues must be addressed. Whilst the ETF is generally supportive of the concept, provided it is deployed taking in to consideration the themes contained in this document, the ETF absolutely rejects the concept of simultaneous operations, i.e. the operation of more than one airport at the same time by one person. The ETF will continue to engage with all stakeholders and take a leading role as Remote Tower technology becomes more widely introduced

The 22-member space programme has just closed its latest decennial recruitment call for astronauts and received more than 22,000 applicants.
"We would like to launch an astronaut with a disability, which would be the first time ever," Dr Aschbacher told Reuters on Friday. "But I'm also happy for ESA because it shows that space is for everyone, and that's something I'd like to convey."
The ESA, whose Ariane rocket once dominated the market for commercial satellite launches, faces ever stiffer competition from tech-funded upstarts like Mr Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Mr Elon Musk's SpaceX.
The challenges are immense: the ESA's 7 billion (S$11.2 billion) budget is a third of Nasa's, while its seven or eight launches a year are dwarfed by the 40 carried out by the United States.
Dr Aschbacher, who grew up staring at the stars above his parents' mountain farm in Austria, said he applied to become an ESA astronaut when he was a student. But what was once a geeky, niche enthusiasm has now become mainstream, he said.
This year's job advertisement attracted almost three times the 8,000 applications received a decade ago, and a quarter of them were from women, up from just 15 per cent before.
The ESA has promised to develop technologies to ensure that those with disabilities, like shortened legs, play a full part.
And those astronauts will go beyond the International Space Station: some will be deployed to the US' planned Gateway station orbiting the Moon, while the ESA's member states are considering an invitation from Chinese and Russian space agencies to participate in their similar moonbase project.</span></div></div>

June 25, 2012
In anticipation of the dual-polarimetric upgrade to the National Weather Service operational radar network (WSR-88D) research is being conducted to utilize this extensive new data source for remote aircraft icing detection. The first challenge is to accurately locate the melting layer. A new image-processing-based algorithm is proposed and demonstrated. The next challenge is to use the dual-polarimetric data above the melting level to distinguish regions containing super-cooled liquid water, which constitutes an aviation icing hazard, from regions of pure ice and snow. It has been well documented that the S-band dual-polarimetric radar signatures at individual range gates of super-cooled liquid water and ice crystals overlap significantly, complicating the identification of icing conditions using individual radar measurements. Recently several investigators have found that the aggregate characteristics of dual-polarimetric radar measurements over regions on the order of several kilometers show distinguishing features between regions containing super-cooled liquid and those with ice only. In this study, the features found in the literature are evaluated, extended and combined using a fuzzy-logic framework to provide an icing threat likelihood. The results of this new algorithm are computed using data collected in Colorado from the Colorado State University CHILL radar and the National Center for Atmospheric Research S-Pol radar (collectively called FRONT – The Front Range Observational Testbed) collected in the winter of 2010/2011 in coordination with the NASA Icing Remote Sensing System (NIRSS) and compared to pilot reports on approach or departure from nearby airports. The preliminary results look encouraging and will be presented. The ultimate goal is to produce an end-to-end algorithm to produce a reliable icing threat product that can then be combined with existing icing detection systems to improve their performance.</span></div></div>

By Bulbul Singh
30 Sep 09. India’s homegrown Light Combat Helicopter [LCH] Program is
facing technical problems as the helicopter is said to be overweight for high altitude missions. The Indian Army and Air Force need the LCH to replace Russian Mi-35 helicopters. The LCH is scheduled to enter service by 2012 but the latest technical problems could delay the whole program.
Sources in India’s State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) which is developing the LCH said, “The helicopter is overweight by as much as 600 kilograms which will make it difficult for smoother operations in the upper reaches. Indian defence forces need LCH to replace the aging Russian Mi-35 for logistic and combat purposes in higher reaches of the northern Jammu and Kashmir and also along the Indo-Chinese border.
LCH is a twin-engined, 5.5-ton helicopter and will carry air-to-air missiles, 20mm guns, unguided rockets and cluster bombs, grenade launchers and anti-radiation missiles.
The helicopter will be equipped with missile warning systems, anti-missile countermeasures, and night-attack-capable cockpit displays. Its narrow fuselage will be stealthy, and its landing gear will be built to handle hard landings.
In addition, LCHwill carry a homegrown gyro-stabilized sighting system comprising a high-performance thermal imager and laser rangefinder with a four-kilometer detection range of a NATO tank target. Known as the Heliborne-Thermal Imaging System (HELITIS), it provides a stabilization accuracy of 30 micro-radians and is intended for target recognition and engagement. Most of the weaponry and equipment is being procured from overseas defence companies.
Currently, the weapons and other equipment are being tested on the weaponised version of the Advance Light Helicopter (ALH), produced by HAL.
The LCH is intended to shoot down UAVs and slow-moving aircraft, escort troop-carrying copters on special operations, destroy enemy air defenses, fight in urban environments, and destroy tanks and other vehicles.
LCH is scheduled to enter service by 2012, but technical problems with weight could mean the helicopter could be delayed as the users, the Indian Army and Air Force are likely to reject an overweight LCH.
“Both the Indian Army and Air Force have a Requirement for around 150 LCHs, in case LCH is delayed, the Indian defence ministry may have to go for a global hunt for this category of helicopter,” said a senior official in the Indian Ministry of Defence. There is an increased demand for LCH category of helicopters due to greater vigil on the Indo-Chinese border added the official.
India is strengthening its defences along the Indo-Chinese border, which are along higher reaches in the Himalayas and need to support LCH-type helicopters for logistics.
Recently the Indian Navy asked the Indian defence ministry to buy Medium Lift Helicopters from the overseas market and not wait for HAL’s program.
HAL took up the Medium Lift Helicopter program nearly five years ago, but has still to find an international partner. There is a total demand of over 350 Medium Light Helicopters by the three wings of the Indian defence forces, with a major chunk required from the Indian Navy.</span></div></div>

Freshen Up on your Airport Lingo before taking your next trip.
Apron – The paved area upon which the airplanes park
All Call – Each Flight attendant is being asked to report from their station for an intercom call
Concourse – Area of the airport located past the security checkpoint
Concourse Shoes – High-heeled pumps that flight attendants usually wear while walking through the airport
DeadHead – crew members who are flying as passengers — not staff on your flight
EFC Time – Expected time for the grounded plane to become airborne
Jumpseat – The fold-down chairs that flight attendants sit on
Open Jaw – reservations that leave from one city and return to another city
SkyCap – airline employees that can help you with your baggage.
Slam-Click – a flight attendant that refuses to stay out with the other flight crew while scheduled to stay overnight . They go straight to their hotel room and do not come out until the morning.</span></div></div>

The airline transport pilot and his passenger were not injured, but the aircraft, which was owned and operated by Teton Holding Company, LLC, sustained substantial damage. The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight, which departed Rexburg, Idaho, about 15 minutes prior to the accident, was being operated in visual meteorological conditions. No flight plan had been filed. There was no report of an ELT activation. Use your browsers 'back' function to return to synopsisReturn to Query Page
According to the pilot, who was landing in calm wind condition, the touchdown and beginning of the landing roll were uneventful. But as the aircraft began to slow, it started to drift to the right and he attempted to apply corrective rudder inputs. During his attempt to realign the aircraft with the runway, the soles of the hiking boots he was wearing got caught on either the edge of the rudder pedals or on each other. He was therefore momentarily unable to apply the appropriate corrective inputs, and by the time he was able to freely move his feet, the aircraft had entered a ground loop from which he was unable to recover. During the ground loop, the aircraft departed the runway, encountered soft terrain and nosed over.</span></div></div>

WASHINGTON — In a stunning setback for a nuclear missile force already beset by missteps and leadership lapses, the U.S. Air Force disclosed on Wednesday that 34 officers entrusted with the world’s deadliest weapons have been removed from launch duty for allegedly cheating — or tolerating cheating by others — on routine proficiency tests.
tap here to see other videos from our team.
The cheating scandal is the latest in a series of Air Force nuclear stumbles documented in recent months by The Associated Press, including deliberate violations of safety rules, failures of inspections, breakdowns in training, and evidence that the men and women who operate the missiles from underground command posts are suffering burnout. In October the commander of the nuclear missile force was fired for engaging in embarrassing behaviour, including drunkenness, while leading a U.S. delegation to a nuclear exercise in Russia.
A “profoundly disappointed” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, the service’s top civilian official, told a hurriedly arranged Pentagon news conference that the alleged cheating at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, was discovered during a previously announced probe of drug possession by 11 officers at several Air Force bases, including two who also are in the nuclear force and suspected of participating in the cheating ring.
“This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour,” James said of the cheating, which Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said could be the biggest such scandal in the history of the missile force.</span></div></div>

It is a stretched and more powerful development of the Bell 230, which, in turn, was based on the earlier Bell 222. The Bell 430 features several significant improvements over the 230, the most significant of these being the new four-blade, bearingless, hingeless, composite main rotor. Although both the 230 and 430 are powered by Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250 turbo shaft engines, the 430's engines are 10% more powerful. Other changes include the 1 ft 6 in (46 cm) stretched fuselage, providing for two extra seats, an optional EFIS flight deck and a choice of either skids or retractable wheeled undercarriage.

Oldland CNC is manufacturing 83 of the 147 Future Lynx primary structure monolithic machined components and supplying them to GKN Aerospace for incorporation into the airframe prior to delivery to AgustaWestland.
‘The start of manufacture of the Future Lynx represents an important step in the evolution of the next generation of Lynx for the Ministry of Defence,’ said Graham Cole, managing director business, AgustaWestland. ‘As the first programme to be signed under the Strategic Partnering Arrangement I am delighted that every programme milestone has been met on time and we look forward to the first flight in late 2009.’
The first Future Lynx, a Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter (BRH) variant for the British Army, is scheduled to fly in 2009 and will be followed by the first surface combatant maritime rotorcraft (SCMR) variant for the Royal Navy.
The BRH and SCMR variants have over 90% commonality and are powered by CTS800-4N engines.
In June 2006 the Ministry of Defence awarded a contract valued at nearly £1bn to supply 70 Future Lynx helicopters comprising 40 BRH variants and 30 SCMR variants with options for a further 10 aircraft.
The BRH variant will enter operational service in 2013 and the SCMR variant in 2014. So far, more than 80 per cent of the project design activity has been completed with a full air vehicle critical design review scheduled to take place in April 2008.</span></div></div>

Mark Memmott on October 24th, 2013
A post at Space.com led us to a NASA video that we find fascinating.
In it, astronaut Karen Nyberg, one of the six people now aboard the International Space Station, demonstrates how little effort it takes to move around in microgravity.
She takes a single strand of hair from her head, stretches it across a handrail and pushes off. You can watch as Nyberg then floats across the station. (And, yes, there’s a connection to Sandra Bullock and the movie Gravity, as you’ll see.)
This isn’t her first hair-related video. In July, Nyberg demonstrated how she washes those long locks.
The 44-year-old Nyberg, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas, flew on a Space Shuttle Discovery mission to the space station in 2008. Her second trip to space began on May 28. She’s scheduled to return to Earth on Nov. 10.

In recent years, the United States aerospace and defense industry has become increasingly invested in vehicles traveling at hypersonic speed, or more than five times faster than the speed of sound. But what happens when an object travels that fast? College of Science and Engineering professors Tom Schwartzentruber and Graham Candler are working with multiple universities across the country to find out.
Hypersonic vehicles travel at speeds higher than Mach 5, or more than 3,800 miles per hour. For reference, a commercial airplane cruises at speeds ranging from 460 and 575 miles per hour. A hypersonic vehicle can be a plane, missile, or spacecraft—such as a satellite re-entering Earth’s atmosphere or a vessel landing on Mars.

Originally designed to replace the P-61 Black Widow, this design by Northrop won an Air Force bid in 1945, and saw its maiden flight in August of 1948. The first production airframe, designated F-89A, took to flight in September 1950 with two permanently mounted wingtip fueltanks. After the first major upgrade to the B-version, the aircraft entered active service in 1951, but severe problems were found with several systems, including the engines. The C-version soon came to life, but soon the major production model m, the F-89D started rolling out of the factories.
The D-version separated itself from its predecessor by replacing the wingtip fueltanks with underwing droptanks, so to make room for two wingtip mounted 70 mm rocket pods, arming the F-89D with 104 Mighty Mouse FFAR rockets. A total of 682 D-models were constructed. For some reason, the E,F,G models were propsed but skipped, and an upgrade to the F-89H happened in 1956. The final variant was the F-89J, and it was provided with two underwing pylons capable of carrying the nuclear Genie rocket. By the end of 1969, all Scorpions were retired in US service.
length: 16.40 m
wingspan: 18.20 m
max. takeoff weight: 19.2 metric tons
powerplant: 2x Allison J-35 turbojets with afterburners for 7200 lbf
maximum speed: 635 mph
service ceiling: 15,000 m
armament: 104 70 mm might Mouse rockets
All of the above assuming someone on Wikipedia did his homework correctly
Let's start off with the mandatory sprue shots:
As you can see, the kit comes with some nice recessed panellines, and some details in the wheelbays as well. This comes at the price of some sinkmarks left and right, but for a Revell molding from 1991, I'm completely happy.
I'll be building the D-version, as in my mind there's no choice to be made when you have those wingtip rocket pods! And so, we'll be doing the version from the boxart. I bought myself some of the AK Extreme metal paints the other day and the natural metal part of this bird will be done with those. It'll be interesting to see if I can get a good a result as Phil did.
As usual, the cockpit is the first to be tackled. Two seats of 4 parts each are easily constructed, and the rest of the cockpit parts released from the sprue. No details whatsoever for the instrument panels or side panels, but since revell provide decals there, I'm gla they didn't bother. Saves me the trouble of sanding off the lot of it....
Next up: gluing up the rocketpods and fueltanks. Seams were filled with some filler, and are awaiting sanding.
And that's pretty much it for a first update. The next update should have paint.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">US Air Force AFWERX has awarded ZeroEyes a contract to deliver its AI gun detection solution for the service’s unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at the Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.
The $1.25 million Direct-to-Phase II SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grant is the third contract the air force has awarded to the firm this year.
ZeroEyes’ technology will enable UAVs to detect handheld weapons for base protection.
The detection system is programmed with machine learning software with internet protocol security cameras that “identify the gun before the first shot is fired.”
After identification, the system shares screenshots of threats. An operator at a control facility confirms the weapon and triggers the drones to activate its response and interference components.
The entire process of AI-based gun detection takes three to five seconds, according to the firm.
“A quarter of active shootings take place on government property, and we will take every step possible to protect our Airmen,” Dover Air Force Base Chief innovation Officer Capt. Nicholas Martini said.
“ZeroEyes’ technology not only provides another layer of security; it will also enable us to reduce our investment in security personnel and use our manpower for more mission-critical tasks.”
ZeroEyes’ Gun Detection in USAF
USAF’s 325th Security Forces Squadron tested the ZeroEyes’ AI detection solution at Tyndall Air Force Base in March.
“The AI software can identify weapons such as shotguns, rifles and other weapon models,” said 325th Security Forces Squadron Tech and Innovation Officer-in-Charge Staff Sgt. Nicholas Murphy said.
“This innovation in technology is ‘early warning’ in nature and can help security forces Airmen save seconds that will save lives.”
“It is fully mission capable and due to that presence, it is a deterrence to stop or mitigate damage. The AI meets our mission intent because these technologies are used to strengthen our multi-layered base defense capability and augment our manpower.”
Other Contracts from AFWERX
In June, the firm received a $750,000 SBIR contract from AFWERX for the research, development, and deployment of the detection software at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.
One month later, Zero Eyes secured another $1.2 million contract to integrate the technology at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.</span></div></div>

It provides the space for power plant, cargo, controls, accessories, passengers and other requirements depending on the purpose i.
The discovered flaws or cracks are then analyzed for their criticality. The long and short length approximations are matching with the experimental results on their respective domains.
Radial stresses at the root of the notch Figure 1.
The symmetry boundary condition is applied on the lines on left of the plate and the line on the Finite element analysis of a fuselage of the plate and ahead of the crack tip.
Firstly, we develop a finite element model with detailed material property, ply design, fixture structure, and actuators installation considered. This is essential to accurately capture the high gradients of stress variations near the crack tip. The direction of the crack is defined by selecting the three adjacent left nodes from the crack tip.
Fracture mechanics, combined with the conventional fatigue design modals now became an integral part of mechanical engineering design. In order to improve the dimensional quality and increase the productivity, a new shape control system has been proposed to conduct dimensional shape adjustment before the assembly process.
For the initial analysis in the section 1. Thus, plane stress assumption is valid in this case. Substituting these values at the above equation we get,?? Suppose a given plate with a crack, is loaded in tension. There are many commercial tools available for solving the real life problems using FE methods.
By using finite element analysis, we conduct the feasibility analysis of this new shape control system. But, the long length approximated equation fail to achieve satisfactory results in this case. The state of stress existing in the portion of the fuselage between the rivet holes is considered to be similar to that of a wide thin plate subjected to uniform stress containing a circular hole in the middle Figure 1.
The finite element model is then validated and calibrated by physical experimental data. A new composite fuselage shape control system is proposed. For the verification of its results, the analysis is repeated by varying the length of singular elements.
Thus, it is dangerous to use this equation for design purposes. The condition prevailing in this case is known as plane strain case. Airbus Corporation Due to their criticality, the aircraft fuselages are periodically inspected using NonDestructive Testing NDT methods for any potential flaws.
Simplified Model of Crack prevalent in relatively thin plates in which there is no considerable variation in displacements along the direction of thickness. The second set is calculated using the approximated equation for a short length crack from section 1.
From the theoretical calculations in section 1. Thus, it can be said that the FE solution is valid. However for a thick plate, material away from the free surfaces is not free to deform laterally as it is constrained by the surrounding material.
The tangential stress at any point on the plate is given by,?? The FE analysis can be repeated for different lengths of cracks in order to find out the relationship between the stress intensity factor and the crack length.
The condition is mainly Figure 1. From the figure, it is clear that the FEA results are most closely matching the empirical relation based on experimental results. But, the short length equation fails in this case.Finite Element Analysis of a Fuselage Crack.

This replaced an earlier Sector Understanding, agreed in 1987, which used to regulate Export Credit financing.
Under the new ASU, OECD member states and, for the first time, Brazil have entered into a gentlemen’s agreement setting out the parameters under which export credit support can be made available for financing civilian aircraft.
The ASU applies to financing for new and used aircraft, spare engines and parts, maintenance contracts, conversion contracts and other modification work and engine kits. It does not apply to financing military aircraft or to flight simulators. As with the previous ASU there are separate terms for large and other aircraft.
For new aircraft, the main developments include:
- Specified minimum levels of insurance or guarantee premia that should be charged by the participating Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) for providing cover. These are calculated by reference (amongst other things) to the credit rating of the airline.
- A discount for premia charged by ECAs to airlines in countries, which have ratified the Cape Town Convention in a satisfactory manner. The maximum permitted discount will also depend on the credit rating of the airline.
- For large (Category 1) aircraft repayment terms remain at 12 years. For “Category 2 Aircraft”1 terms can be extended to fifteen years, with ten years maximum repayment allowed for smaller aircraft (“Category 3”).
- For Category 1 aircraft, one or more “risk mitigants” are required for riskier airlines. These include lower than 85 per cent advance rates, 10 rather than 12 year repayment terms and straight line rather than mortgage repayment profile.
- Financings for all Boeing and Airbus aircraft (other than Category 2 Aircraft) should amortise at least quarterly.
- Financings for other aircraft will continue to amortise semi-annuall
- Financings for most aircraft will continue to amortise, either on a straightline or mortgage-style amortisation curve, to zero. However, there is more flexibility for smaller aircraft.
- Fixed Rate financing is not available for Category 1 aircraft – Pure Cover fixed rates are allowed.
- ECA-backed support for an aircraft may be put into place at any time within 18 months of its delivery from the manufacturer with the prior agreement of the ECA (but the maximum term of the financing should be calculated from that original delivery date).
- Any extension of the repayment term by way of sharing of rights in the security on a pari passu basis with the commercial lenders (by way of mismatch or SOAR loans) is no longer permitted.
- Cover is available for a maximum of 85 per cent of the net price of the aircraft (i.e. net of airframe/engine manufacturer credits), plus the cost of BFE.
- Fees must be charged on the undrawn amount of any support to which an ECA commits, if the commitment persists for longer than six months.
- Financing may be made available in Yen.
- For large aircraft transitional arrangements are in place for existing export contracts notified to the OECD by 30 June 2007 (for deliveries to occur on or before 31 December 2010 in respect of firm contracts concluded no later than 30 April 2007).</span></div></div>

2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of the world famous Royal International Air Tattoo. In 1971, in aid of the Royal Air Forces Association, North Weald hosted the first Air Tattoo. Later, the Tattoo moved onto Greenham Common, and ended up at what is now considered to be the home of the Air Tattoo, RAF Fairford. Themes for this year’s anniversary edition were STAR 11 (Strike, Attack and Reconnaissance), Tiger 50 (to mark the 50th anniversary of the NATO Tiger Association), and of course RIAT’s own 40th Birthday.
The Tiger theme was well supported with F-16s from Belgium, Mirage 2000s from France and Tornados from Germany all present, wearing attractive and eye catching colour schemes applied for the official Tiger Meet that was held in France earlier this year. ‘Heavies’ included an RC-135V from the USAF and an E-6 from US NAVY. The Royal Air Force’s latest aircraft, the Airbus A330, was another attraction in this section. Then we had an edgy CASA 295-AEW ; to complete this list , a very rare and discret A-310 from German Air Force.The main attraction for many enthusiasts were an Ukrainian Air Force IL-76 and Su-27. Booked by RIAT ‘for the enthusiasts’ and as part of their 40th Anniversary.
The superb RAF Tornado role demonstration, which brought plenty of noise with high speed, low level flying and pyrotechnics. The Red Arrows put on their usual highly slick display before the French Air Force Rafale showed what a fourth generation fighter being flown by a regular Air Force pilot really can do. The Frecce Tricolori put on their typically flamboyant show before the BAe Systems Typhoon put on a stunning display with a full weapons load. Attending the show as operational commitments currently prevent the RAF from displaying the Typhoon, BAe Chief test pilot Mark Bowman was awarded the Steedman Sword for his display.
The 40th Anniversary of RIAT was marked by the Old Flying Machine Company’s warbird pair of Spitfire MH434 and P-51D Mustang “Ferocious Frankie”. The significance of this display to the anniversary was the simple fact that MH434 appeared at the very first IAT in 1971. The slow pace continued with the Belgian Air Force Red Devils, RAF Tutor and Tucano and the The Royal Jordanian Falcons, with only the ever impressive RAF Chinook and the Army Air Corps Apache injecting any real life into the display. The ‘Solo Türk’ F-16 and Saudi Hawks, both of which were UK debutants.
Six Hawker Hunters marked another anniversary, this time the 60th of that particular type, as Team Viper’s four aircraft were joined by the Swiss Hunter Team’s T68 and Jonathan Whaley’s F58A “Miss Demeanour”. When the A-10 took to the skies that it felt like the Air Tattoo had resumed. Thankfully, the USAF West Coast Demonstration Team’s Warthog display was mighty, showing the performance of the aircraft as well as simulating strafing and bombing runs.
On both mornings it was raining fairly heavily with a low cloud base which prevented flying getting underway at the advertised time. On Saturday it was not possible for the flying to start until around midday and, with seemingly no flexibility shown, a number of star items were lost from the schedule that day. Despite this weather problem ; i was globaly satisfied by this edition of RIAT.</span></div></div>

Several of Recaro Aircraft Seating’s sensor-equipped BL3530 iSeats are now in service aboard a TAP Air Portugal Airbus A321 aircraft, marking the first time an “intelligent” seat has made its way into the economy cabin. Besides improving crew efficiency during takeoff and landing and being capable of predictive maintenance, these seats can create a high-level picture of passenger needs – and inform Recaro’s next generation of aircraft seating.
The iSeats are indistinguishable on the outside from their less intelligent cousins, but they gather data on passenger behavior, such as when the seat is occupied, and how many times a passenger deploys the tray table, raises the armrests or reclines the seat. They also record whether a seatbelt is fastened, and that a seat is in full upright position. “We believe that a ‘smart’ seat will have the most impact on safety-of-flight operations,” says Dr. Mark Hiller, CEO of Recaro Aircraft Seating. “Passenger comfort such as temperature, recline and cushion pressure is another development we are looking at,” Hiller adds. On long flights, the seat could remind the passenger to stretch or help them get higher-quality rest.
Recaro’s iSeats were slated for a six-month trial with TAP, which began in September last year, with data pulled on a bimonthly basis. “There are more ideas for further developments and further sensor installation, but we wanted to start with something more basic as a proof of concept and set up a process that then could be utilized for a more extensive array of sensors,” says Nuno Leal, head of Fleet Planning and Contracts at TAP.
Leal hopes the data culled from the seats will improve the seat development process in the future. “The development of new seats is typically based on subjective ideas and perceptions of comfort and behavior, not on an empirical approach like this one,” he says. “We hope, down the line, this will result in a better seat, more tailor-made to our passengers’ requirements.”
“Raising Seat Awareness” was originally published in the 10.1 February/March issue of APEX Experience magazine.</span></div></div>

I know making and coding the physics of these machines are hard but I think given the success of your UH-60 and EC135, more helicopters would be a great addition to the sim.
Helis id like to see implemented into the Sim one day
- Bell 412
- AW101(my fav and highly requested)
- Bell 429
- AW149 or 139
and the aw159
Fixed wing I’d like to see
- Eurofighter(highly requested)
- Texan Tucano
- Hawk t2 or t1
With the new update on the way I think adding more helicopters to fly around the new and improved scenery would be amazing as it would add more realism to close ground ops. I understand creating new aircraft is a timely project but I really think my helicopter suggestions are good base aircraft to start with and there’s a lot of information on their cockpit systems. I know there’s a lot of info about the AW101 Merlin avionics and its cockpit features.
I’m adding this to the mobile thread as PC users can make and add their own aircraft.
Thanks for reading and I’d love to hear back from the community and IPACS</span></div></div>

March 08, 2019
Train like you fight – the U.S. military’s training motto – pushes U.S. Department of Defense planners to provide the technology that enables pilots, sailors, maintainers, etc. to be able to perform their duties as if they were second nature.
The current deployment of 4th- and 5th-generation fighter aircraft – all loaded with cutting-edge avionics, sensors, and smart weapons – requires modernized embedded training systems to properly simulate aircraft operations and functionality for training. An example of this is the U.S. Air Force’s T-X advanced jet trainer program, launched in late 2018. The Boeing/Saab T-X fighter jet will train pilots to fly 4th- and 5th-generation jets using the latest cutting-edge technology, including embedded training systems and smart weapons.
The Air Force plans to purchase 351 T-X aircraft and 46 simulators, as well as associated ground equipment, with the goal of replacing the venerable T-38C Talon supersonic jet trainer (Figure 1), which has been in service for 50-plus years.

The Air Force also has the option to purchase as many as 475 aircraft and 120 simulators, making this a big moneymaker for Boeing, Saab, and its subcontractors. The first trainer and simulator are expected to arrive in 2023, at which point undergraduate pilots will transition to training on the T-X platform.
“Cockpit and sensor management are fundamentally different today in 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft than it was when the T-38 was built in 1961,” says Brig. Gen. Dawn Dunlop, the director of plans, programs and requirements at Air Education and Training Command, in an Air Force news release. “While the T-38 has been upgraded to a glass cockpit, the inability to upgrade the T-38’s performance and simulated sensor capability presents a growing challenge each year to effectively teach the critical skills essential to today’s military pilots.”
Aging technology in military systems is arguably the most dangerous of threats. Dunlop’s notes that “12 of 18 advanced pilot training tasks can’t be completed with the T-38, relying on fighter and bomber formal training units to complete the training at a much greater cost.”
“This new aircraft will provide the advanced training capabilities we need to increase the lethality and effectiveness of future Air Force pilots,” says Heather A. Wilson, secretary of the Air Force, upon the announcement of the T-X program. “Through competition we will save at least $10 billion on the T-X program.”
Boeing and Saab teamed up to deliver a design that addresses both the aging technology on the T-38C and the cost of constant retrofits and upgrades. Boeing and Saab documents describe the T-X aircraft as sporting one engine, twin tails, stadium seating, and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. (Figure 2.)

General Electric, Collins Aerospace, and Triumph are among those companies subcontracted to produce the T-X.
General Electric (Boston, Massachusetts) provides the GE F404 engine for the program: “The F404s will replace another GE engine, the J85, which was used on the previous generation of T-X trainers,” according to an October 2018 story in GE Reports. “Designed in the late 1950s, the J85 was the first small turbojet to operate with an afterburner and was also the first GE engine with a variable-exhaust nozzle. In the early 1960s, a commercial variant of the engine powered the first Learjets, a family of pioneering private jets for business executives.”
Collins Aerospace (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), a United Technologies Corp. business unit, will provide the ACES 5 ejection seat that provides pilots with passive head and neck protection. The ACES 5 also has arm- and leg-flail prevention, as well as a load-compensating catapult rocket. Collins will also supply the aircraft’s landing gear system.
While Saab is responsible for the aft fuselage and associated subsystems, it will rely on Triumph Group (Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for design, development, manufacture, and support for the aircraft mounted accessory drives (AMAD) and hydraulic systems.
Full operational capability for the T-X fleet is expected by 2034.</span></div></div>

The conversations, contained on a tape salvaged from cabin debris on the ocean floor, indicate the seven crew members weren't aware of impending danger before the shuttle broke apart 74 seconds into flight, officials have said.
NASA has definitely decided to release a transcript, which should identify which of the crew members spoke and their comments, said June Stewart, an agency attorney in Washington.
''A number of top people at headquarters have listened to the tape and compared it with a transcript'' prepared at Johnson Space Center in Houston, she said Friday.
Jim McCulla, a spokesman at NASA headquarters in Washington, said attorneys were still going over the transcript to determine if anything, such as possible expletives, should be deleted.
Relatives of two crew members said they do not object to the release of transcripts.
''I guess we wouldn't have any trouble with that,'' said Ellen Jarvis of Orlando, stepmother of payload specialist Greg Jarvis. She said that she and her husband Bruce were not aware the tape had been transcribed.
''I think it would actually make us feel very relieved if we could hear Greg say something uplifting at a time like that,'' she said. ''Any words he said that indicated he was still happy at that time would make us feel better.''
Marvin Resnik, father of Judy Resnik, said through a spokesman that he had been told what was on the tape and had no objection to release of a transcript.
The space agency announced last week that a preliminary analysis of the damaged tape indicated that the astronauts had made comments that would be considered normal during a launch.
Studies continued this week, and attorneys in Washington received a transcript Thursday, said Doug Ward, an agency spokesman in Houston. He said technicians also are studying data that was recorded on the tape, but that is not expected to provide any new information.
The tape was analyzed by a ''handful'' of astronauts and others in the flight crew operations office, Ward said.
The tape had been damaged by salt water and caustic chemicals, but IBM technicians were able to restore it.</span></div></div>

“With large-area repairs, the difficulty in maintaining uniform temperature increases thermal characteristics of the part as well as the limitations of large heat blankets," explains HEATCON President Eric Casterline.
"This has created a unique need for the network controller in the composites market.”
Hot bonders, heat blankets and other equipment from Seattle, USA, based HEATCON are used to repair composite aircraft components that require bonding processes. The network controller was designed to address advanced repair designs required for the newest airplanes and helicopters. The increased use of composites for commercial airlines has created a need for equipment to address the challenge of ensuring proper cure cycles over large repair areas, which supports processes from manufacturers and regulatory agencies as they become approved.
The geometrically complex shapes in the newest aircraft, which use increasing amounts of composite materials, will require more sophisticated repairs. Many of these advanced repair techniques can be better addressed using the network controller, HEATCON says.
“Substructure under a laminate surface can act as a heat sink, increasing the possibility of non-uniform temperature cures,” Casterline reports.
“The network controller has the capability of addressing advanced repair designs required for the latest aircraft. It allows coordination of a number of repair zones and has the ability to handle complex and demanding repair scenarios.”
Using a single bonder to fix large areas of a composite part makes it difficult to control the temperature throughout the entire repair area. A typical bonder managing two repair zones may not provide sufficient coverage for controlling critical temperatures throughout the entire repair area.
Connecting several bonders to the new network controller lets technicians provide uniform temperatures, which improves the integrity of the part being repaired, HEATCON reports.</span></div></div>

A Russian military communications satellite rode a Soyuz rocket and Fregat upper stage Thursday into an orbit stretching nearly 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) above Earth, successfully launching after a one-month delay to replace a suspect third stage on the Soyuz booster.
The Soyuz-2.1a rocket lifted off with a Meridian M communications satellite from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia at 0824:54 GMT (3:24:54 a.m. EST) Thursday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.
After taking off from the military-operated spaceport, the Soyuz booster headed southeast from Plesetsk over Russian territory and dropped its four liquid-fueled first stage boosters, core second stage and payload shroud in the first five minutes of the mission.
The Soyuz third stage ignited to place the mission’s Fregat upper stage and the Meridian M spacecraft on a suborbital trajectory. After separating from the Soyuz third stage, the Fregat main engine was expected to fire three times to maneuver the Meridian M spacecraft into an elliptical, or egg-shaped, orbit ranging between roughly 600 and 25,000 miles (about 1,000 kilometers by 39,700 kilometers) above Earth, with an inclination of 62.8 degrees to the equator.
The launch was delayed from Jan. 24 due to an electrical problem detected in the Soyuz rocket’s third stage. Russian teams elected to replace the third stage with a new unit, pushing back the launch date by nearly a month.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Fregat upper stage deployed the Meridian M satellite into its targeted orbit, and ground teams from the Russian Aerospace Forces took control of the new spacecraft.
The defense ministry said Thursday ground controllers established a stable communications link with the satellite, and systems on-board the spacecraft are functioning normally.
The Meridian spacecraft are manufactured by ISS Reshetnev, a Russian space contractor, as replacements for a previous generation of Molniya communications satellites. The Russian contractor says the Meridian satellites weigh around 2.1 metric tons, or 4,630 pounds, and can operate for at least seven years in space.
Thanks to their elliptical orbits, Meridian satellites can link Russian ground forces, aircraft, ships and command centers in the Arctic, Siberia and the North Sea, outside the reach of stable communications coverage through geostationary satellites over the equator.
In one example of the Meridian fleet’s communications mission, the Russian Defense Ministry said the satellites relay signals between coastal stations and vessels and ice reconnaissance airplanes traveling along the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic Ocean.
With Thursday’s mission, Russia has launched nine Meridian communications satellites since 2006 to begin replacing the Molniya family of data relay platforms. One of the Meridian satellites was lost in a Soyuz launch failure in 2011, and another was released into an off-target orbit in 2009.
Thursday’s launch sent the second upgraded Meridian M-class spacecraft into orbit. The first of the new batch of Meridian M satellites launched in July 2019.
The Meridian satellites are a part of Russia’s Integrated Satellite Communications System, working with the Russian military’s Raduga, or Globus, military data relay satellites in geostationary orbit.

They helm a fleet of three Robinson R44 helicopters, as well as R22 whirlybirds, each spacious enough for up to three guests. Along the way, skybound guests peep at the area's arterial highways, majestic mountains, and winding Chattahoochee River, intermittently soaring high enough to fly over skyscrapers while avoiding most feral clouds.
Pilots also instill basics of takeoff, steering, and landing during flight-training programs that start students off on the cloud-kicking path to obtaining private, commercial, and flight-instructor licenses. When not leading tours and training programs, the skywaymen shuttle passengers between airports and hotels and take aerial photographers up for photo shoots.
Humans dreamed of achieving flight for millennia, driven by the desire to find out what clouds taste like (a lot like fog, it turns out). Take to the skies with today's Groupon. For $40 per person, you get a quarter-hour private helicopter tour from Whirl Helicopter Atlanta, a $79 value. Depart from McCollum Airport in Kennesaw and fly to Kennesaw Mountain and over Marietta Square and the Big Chicken.
The 3,600-second Discovery Flight sits you side by side with one of the school's certified flight instructors in a Robinson R22 helicopter. After a brief ground school that covers the basics, you'll strap into the cockpit of this reliable, safe little bird and cover essential preflight principles such as breathing and not making eye contact for more than three seconds. Listen to the purr of the engine that's won the R22 major-speed and distance-performance records, while your steady hands maintain hovering level. From there you'll try a short flight around the area, with the instructor offering helpful guidance along the way.
The male and female firearm experts of American Home Defense shape their shooting and self-defense classes around legal regulations with an emphasis on personal safety. In private shooting lessons, students learn to handle three of the most common handguns and home-defense classes equip participants with the know-how to protect their families from intruders or a neighbor's moat monster.
The FAA–certified instructors at Wesson Aviation instill safe-flying habits in budding aviators, whether their aim is to casually jaunt through the clouds or to pursue a license for flying a plane, helicopter, or really large, specially folded piece of paper. No matter their aerial pursuit, pilots learn on modern and well-maintained equipment. The Bell Jet Ranger helicopter has flown about 1,400 hours and spoils students with modern avionic equipment, such as a Garmin GPS, radar altimeter, and heating and air conditioning—creature comforts to revel in when playing long hide-and-seek games with a stealth bomber. Students can also work toward their FAA pilot certification for private, commercial, or instructor flight at more than 200 miles per hour aboard the outfit’s twin-engine Beechcraft Baron airplane.:
Ron Carroll's fascination with helicopters began in Vietnam, when the aircraft transported him and his fellow infantry through the jungles to the front lines. Two Purple Hearts, nearly 20 years, and a stint in the publishing industry later, Carroll happened upon a copy of Flying magazine and his interest quickly rekindled. He continued with flying lessons, deepening his desire to become a helicopter pilot.
Today, Carroll possesses a Gold Seal CFI certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and helms a team of three pilots with more than 25,000 combined hours of flight experience. With a fleet comprising Robinson R22 and R44 helicopters?as well as a TruFlite H flight simulator that lets aspiring pilots practice operating a helicopter while singing and without leaving the ground?the team has trained throngs of airmen, including Governor Sonny Perdue.</span></div></div>

Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the public-use flight. The helicopter was substantially damaged and the commercial-rated pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor injuries. The flight originated about 5 minutes earlier. Use your browsers 'back' function to return to synopsisReturn to Query Page
The pilot stated that the first flight departed at 1915, to spray chemical for mosquitoes but returned due to plugged spray nozzles that he noted midpoint of the second spray pass. Without securing the engine, the plugged nozzles were replaced and the flight departed to again spray chemical. After takeoff while flying about 200-250 feet above ground level (agl) at an indicated airspeed of 30-40 knots, with a 10-15 knot wind from the southeast, he began a left turn to line up for his spray swath. The helicopter yawed 20-30 degrees to the right which could not be corrected with full left anti-torque pedal input. He lowered the collective in an attempt to recover but with insufficient altitude, the helicopter collided with trees then the ground. He further stated that there was no engine or flight control malfunction and the right yaw is a characteristic of "loss of tail rotor effectiveness."</span></div></div>

Branson to rent space lab to scientists
Richard Branson wants to rent out his space lab to Virgin Galactic scientists.
And although NASA scientists have already expressed interest, they aren’t the only ones looking to use the space lab.
The BBC reports:
- passengers will ride the rocket plane for the fun of it, but scientists would use it for the same reasons they also fly experiments on the International Space Station or on sounding rockets—to access microgravity conditions
- the weightless environment provides a unique perspective on physical systems and processes and is helping researchers to better understand disease and to develop new materials
- geoscientists might want to use it to pursue a range of research fields, including atmospheric chemistry, climate studies, space weather, or Earth imagery
The cost of using the lab for science would be about $200,000, according to the report.
Since NASA shut down its own Shuttle program in 2011, the agency has become the venture capitalists of the private space race — not only buying out lab space from Branson’s Galactic program, but investing $1.6 billion in Elon Musk’s SpaceX to resupply the International Space Station.

The converted SS-18 Satan, known as the Dnepr-1 booster rocket in its new form, blasted off from a silo at the Baikonur cosmodorme in Kazakhstan, a spokesman with Russia's Strategic Missile Forces said.
The launch was the first commercial mission for Russia's arsenal of SS-18 Satans, all of which will have to be destroyed or used for peaceful purposes if Russia ratifies the START II arms reduction treaty.
The cash-strapped government has said that its current stock of Satans are getting old and will have to be decommissioned even if it doesn't ratify START II, which has been delayed in the lower house of parliament.
The SS-18 is Russia's most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of carrying several nuclear warheads. According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, Russia has about 180 of the missiles.
Used as a booster rocket, the SS-18 can put satellites weighing up to four tons into orbit.
Russia is also converting its SS-19 Stiletto ballistic missiles into booster rockets in a bid to increase its share of the profitable market for commercial satellite launches.</span></div></div>

1.1 This specification covers the minimum airworthiness standards a manufacturer shall meet in the designing, testing, and labeling of weight-shift-control aircraft.
1.2 This specification covers only weight-shift-control aircraft in which flight control systems do not use hinged surfaces controlled by the pilot.
Note 1—This section is intended to preclude hinged surfaces such as typically found on conventional airplanes such as rudders and elevators. Flexible sail surfaces typically found on weight-shift aircraft are not considered hinged surfaces for the purposes of this specification.
1.3 Weight-shift-control aircraft means a powered aircraft with a framed pivoting wing and a fuselage (trike carriag
e) controllable only in pitch and roll by the pilot's ability to change the aircraft's center of gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control of the aircraft depends on the wing's ability to flexibly deform rather than the use of control surfaces.
1.4 This specification is organized and numbered in accordance with the bylaws established for Committee F37. The main sections are:
|Design and Construction Requirements||6|
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. Combining values from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the standard.
1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory requirements prior to use.</span></div></div>

Hayabusa is "the most incredible story and achievement," expert says.
Last week scientists confirmed that the recovery chamber aboard the Hayabusa spacecraft contained about 1,500 particles from the surface of the asteroid Itokawa.
This potato-shaped space rock is about 1,755 feet (535 meters) long and orbits about 186 million miles (300 million kilometers) from Earth. Pictures sent back from Hayabusa when it was near the asteroid suggest that Itokawa is a "rubble pile," an amalgamation of rocks held together by gravity.

A mid-day sojourn in moderate winds went sour for one high-time paramotorist resulting in a nearly disastrous impact. Surprisingly, the pilot walked (probably limped) away.
At 20 feet or so while landing, a quick downward gust started folding down the right half of his wing. Momentum and relative wind did the rest, quickly collapsing 70% of his paraglider. All that fabric, now presenting a vertical wall of drag, caused an immediate turn that was aggravated by lift from the open left side. The highly experienced pilot didn’t know what happened until a turn began. Then it was way too late.
It took less than one second from the pilots first feel of trouble to be in an unrecoverable situation. Lest anyone think otherwise, realize that it takes the human brain at least one second just to register a strange sensation. The only way out of this was prevention.
Another 20 feet higher and it would have been much worse. Another 100 feet higher and it would have been recoverable.
It appears he felt something because, although on landing approach, he lifted his legs just before the collapse started. Also, it looks like the wing surged forward somewhat. The most likely scenario is that he flew from the rising air of a thermal into a downward swirl on the other side. That jibes with reports from the pilot and witnesses. See sidebar on the thermal theory. One witness said the pilot reported a blast of warm air just before it happened. Wake turbulence (see sidebar) is a possibility that appears far less likely.
(Above) Frame A through C show a normal, power off approach. Frame D shows him bring his legs up but the wing hasn’t felt anything yet. Frame E reveals the leading edge just starting to be blown down slightly right of center. In Frame F the slipstream is now pushing the wing downward and causing a significant collapse. Notice the pilot is still essentially level and in the same position he has been throughout. His fate is sealed yet he is only aware that something is amiss. From frame E to F is about a half-second. He has just started to turn right in frame G and, at this point, is essentially a passenger. The only out was preventing entry.
Keep in mind, we’re analyzing what took 3 seconds to finish.
It seems the wing surged forward, making it more susceptible to collapse and this hit a bit of downward gust. Dampening that surge could have certainly helped but it may not have been enough. When off power and in turbulence, it’s a good idea to try keeping brake pressure 2 or so (about 1/4 brakes). I suspect this pilot, with his experience did damp it slightly.
Thanks to Steve for sharing the video, James for helping with information and Brent for his perspective.
An experienced paramotor pilot who saw it happen offered his thoughts:
It was around noon. And he was flying over the field trying to get down a couple times before. He said he could feel heat rising off the ground. Just before he crashed he was over the black top taxi way.
So the hot sun could have contributed to it for sure. I had just arrived at the field when it happened and I was just off to the right of the camera. Paul’s brother Steve shot the video of the crash. I shot Ivan later and made the video.
Another flyer and eyewitness offers:
It was around 11:00 or so…He was flying on the downwind side of the runway. After talking to him, he said that just before the wing gave way he had a blast of warm air hit is face.
If you look at the airport diagram below he was east of runway 12/30. Also there are trees to the west and south at 30′ to 60′ feet. With the wind coming over these trees, the heat of the runway, the building to the east of that, (Look at the top picture of the website), something could happen. He was the only one flying at the time, too.
Flying within three hours of sunrise and sunset, and only during forecast mellow conditions is the best prevention. Some pilots, especially free flyers who are used to stronger conditions, will take on the mid-day risk knowingly. Sometimes they get burned.
Winds appear to have been fairly light. If you walked outside and checked, you have considered it nice. Wunderground historical data showed it to be light that Sept 22 noontime. See the charts at right for a temperature graph. Thanks to Terry Lutke for the weather information.
Skill and choice of equipment also has an effect on susceptibility. For example, being heavy on a wing reduces the likelihood of a collapse at some increase in severity. Your choice of a wing affects it, too. A fast, high performance wing is more susceptible than a beginner wing although it can happen to anything—if the air is going down faster than the wing can handle, the leading edge will react this way. A reflex wing, flown in its most resistant configuration, may handle it better, too. Reflex wings don’t fold under as easily although they certainly can and you better know what configurations are susceptible.
Once aloft, a pilot can reduce his chances of this fate by those suggestions covered under Handling Wing Collapses. Essentially keep brake pressure 2 applied, especially with the power off. Fly actively if you’ve already developed that skill, otherwise, now is not the time to learn it. Using just the right brake inputs to keep the wing overhead (active flying) is a skill that takes many hours to master and pilots who don’t fly regularly in moderately bumpy air never acquire it. Strong turbulence is not the place to learn since inappropriate inputs are worse than just holding pressure 2 and letting your hands float with that pressure.
Video of Collapse and Crash
Some interesting points. Notice the video’s time counter. It’s basically over in two seconds. Ivan is one tough bird! The windsock and other pilot input suggests that winds at the time were relatively light (see sidebar on Weather at the Time).</span></div></div>

Mars Express orbiter to get code update after 19 years
And over millions of miles, too. Piece of cake!?
The software on ESA's Mars Express spacecraft is to be upgraded after nearly two decades, giving the orbiter capabilities to hunt for water beneath the planet and study its larger moon, Phobos.
Mars Express was launched on June 2, 2003, and was initially made up of two components: the Mars Express Orbiter and the Beagle 2 lander. Unfortunately, the lander failed to make contact with Earth after it was released and arrived at the surface of the Red Planet. It is presumed lost. The orbiter, however, is still working after 19 years in service, spinning around Mars.
Now, engineers at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF), Italy, are revamping the spacecraft's software. The upgrade will allow the Mars Express Orbiter to continue searching for water locked beneath the Martian surface using its MARSIS radio-wave instrument and monitor the planet's closest satellite, Phobos, more efficiently. MARSIS is today operated by INAF and funded by the Italian Space Agency.
Specifically, according to ESA, the orbiter, which is millions of miles from Earth, will receive "a series of upgrades that improve signal reception and on-board data processing to increase the amount and quality of science data sent to Earth." It appears part of the update will streamline its processes and communications to reduce the information collected by the onboard sensors to just what's needed.
"Previously, to study the most important features on Mars, and to study its moon Phobos at all, we relied on a complex technique that stored a lot of high-resolution data and filled up the instrument's on-board memory very quickly," Andrea Cicchetti, the MARSIS deputy principal investigator and operation manager at INAF, leading the upgrade, explained in a statement.
"By discarding data that we don't need, the new software allows us to switch MARSIS on for five times as long and explore a much larger area with each pass."
Mars Express will thus continue to look for signs of water near the Martian South Pole at high resolutions. Colin Wilson, a scientist working on the mission, said the software was "like having a brand-new instrument on board…almost 20 years after launch."
"The MARSIS radar on-board software upgrade demonstrates that it is possible to renew an entire mission," Cicchetti told The Register in a statement.
"I am not surprised at all that such a mission is still in flight after 19 years. I [have been] working on it every day since its launch, and I am sure that Mars Express will give us the possibility to make many other discoveries in the coming years that will help us to better understand our planet."

- Humanity uploaded an AI to Mars and lets it shoot rocks with lasers
- Australia down for scheduled maintenance: No talking to Voyager 2 for 11 months
Mars Express was ESA's first planetary mission, and is the second oldest active spacecraft orbiting a planet other than Earth. The oldest is NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey. Pushing new software to such an old orbiter after so long is challenging, according to Carlo Nenna, an engineer at Enginium, an Italian IT consulting firm helping to roll out the upgrade.
"We faced a number of challenges to improve the performance of MARSIS," he said. "Not least because the MARSIS software was originally designed over 20 years ago, using a development environment based on Microsoft Windows 98!"
"The very old development environment (it was quite old already back in year 2000) required to set up a Windows 98 machine. I did this with a virtual machine in VirtualBox," he told The Register.
"Just finding a way to share files between host and guest machines was an hard task. Installing common things like a working web browser or a source code editor was difficult too. It took almost two months only to set up and fully validate the development environment."
The spacecraft carries seven instruments, including various cameras, spectrometers, and a radar altimeter to study Mars's atmosphere, climate, and geology. Mars Express was the first to spot signs of water ice and carbon dioxide ice on the planet, leading scientists to question whether it could have been habitable at some point. It also collected data that hinted at signs of methane, possibly forged in the hot furnace of volcanoes long ago.
Finally, the spacecraft orbiter has provided astronomers with some of the most detailed images of Phobos. The Martian moon is shaped like a potato, with an uneven, pockmarked surface unlike the Earth's round Moon. ®</span></div></div>

A cowling is a removable metal covering that houses the engine and sometimes also a portion of the fuselage of an aircraft that is powered by a radial engine. It enables the aircraft to fly more efficiently because it reduces the amount of drag it creates.
The NACA low-drag engine cowling was invented by Fred Weick, an engineer from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, in 1928. The test aircraft for this cowling, a Curtis Hawk AT-5A biplane (see photo), featuring a Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine, reached an airspeed of 220 kilometers pe hour fitted with the NACA cowling compared to 190 kilometers per hour without it.
The NACA cowling directs cool air to flow onto the center of the motor, where it is routed across the motor's hottest parts, i.e. the cylinders and cylinder heads. Moreover, turbulence after the air passes the free-standing cylinders is greatly reduced. The sum of all these effects reduces drag by as much as 60%.
The test conclusions resulted in almost every radial-engined aircraft being equipped with this cowling, starting in 1932. Cowlings are sometimes also used to enclose landing gear.</span></div></div>

Guidance for students wanting to become an airline pilot.
When can you start flying airplanes?
You can fly airplanes with an instructor as early as you wish to. You can learn to fly and carry out solo flights by the age of 16 and you can earn your private pilot license by age 17.
What are the educational qualifications required to become a pilot?
You can earn your pilot license from variety of institutions ranging from small flying clubs, flight schools to universities and the entry requirements will vary from one another. Most flying clubs and flight schools require you to have completed high school grade academics with passes in subjects like English, Math's and Physics. As Maldivian students passes in O level would be sufficient for you to get enrolled in the flight schools. Colleges and universities tend to have higher educational qualification requirements with higher pass grades requirements and may require A level to be completed specially if you are considering to get a degree along with your pilot license. Some institutions also would require you to pass an entrance exam.
Is it essential to get a degree?
It is an old long debate over whether students should attain degrees or just complete flight training and acquire the pilot license only. The advantages of attaining an aviation degree is that you would have learned a lot more in dept knowledge of the industry and it would help in your career down the line specially if you consider to become part of training or in management roles. However as a pilot with career experience you can become instructors, chiefs, and etc without having degrees as experience and on the job performance is a key element in your progress in airlines. Countries in Europe and other countries where pilot jobs are scarce; most of the students earn degrees along with their pilot license to boost their opportunities in gaining pilot jobs. There are larger airlines that require pilots to have a degree however most of the airlines would hire pilots if they have sufficient experience on the job even though they don't have degrees.
In Maldives almost all of the pilots acquire pilot license only and there are only a few who earn degrees. As a student pilots you can finish your pilot training and you can be employed as a pilot and can acquire work experience and progress closer to career advancements by the time students who study for degrees can finish their training's as to complete a degree it would require 3-4 years.
What is PPL, CPL and ATPL?
PPL : It is a Private Pilot License and it allows the pilot to be the pilot in command of an aircraft privately.
CPL : It is a Commercial Pilot License and it allows the pilot to fly and engage in commercial flight operations.
ATPL: It is an Airline Transport Pilot License and it allows the pilot to act as a commander of an aircraft. Frozen ATPL is earned when the student pilot have completed all the theoretical examinations but has not yet met the flight hour requirement to obtain ATPL. As the hour requirement is high for this license, the fight hours required are gained working as a pilot in an airline or building hours as a flight instructor.
In the Maldives if you hold a CPL license you can be employed to fly as a seaplane pilot. For the captaincy requirement in the seaplane you must obtain an ATPL. In order to be employed to fly heavier turbo prop aircraft like the Dash-8 and the ATR you would require to hold a frozen ATPL license as a minimum.
It is highly advisable today to complete frozen ATPL during your flight training as majority of all students study for this and it would aid in earning yourself a job in seaplanes or in wheel based airline. If you have CPL only it would limit your employment options only to seaplane pilot jobs and it would be of a challenge to complete all theoretical examinations required for the ATPL while working as a full time pilot.
What is a type rating?
A type rating is a regulating agency's certification of a pilot to fly a certain aircraft type that requires additional training. As student pilots after completion of your training and after employment within an airline you would complete the type rating course for the type of aircraft you would fly. Seaplane type ratings are carried out in Maldives where as Dash8, ATR and Airbus type ratings are carried out in foreign countries.
What is the difference between different flight schools?
As student pilots you would be obtaining the same pilot licenses issued by the civil aviation authority regardless of the flight school or the university that you attend. Flight schools and universities with higher tuition fees can offer you with the options to fly more advanced training aircraft with glass cockpits. They may have advanced flight simulators for instrument training's and provide you with an overall higher standard of education. Nonetheless you would be studying using the same books and sitting for the same exams and completing your aircraft training as per the regulation from the civil aviation authority regardless of your choice of flight school or university.
How long does flight training lasts?
On average for the completion of the full pilot course with frozen ATPL would take one year half to two years time. Overall completion of the course depends on various factors like individual student performances and weather and etc.
Student performance: The course progression depends a lot on the individuals students performance and the capability to complete all required theoretical exams in given time and complete all the aircraft flying requirements.
Weather: Students would only be allowed to train in fair weather conditions specially if it is for solo flights. Bad weather days with high winds, heavy rain or snow may delay your training as you would not be able to fly during these periods.
Aircraft: Some of the flight schools have limited aircraft available and maintenance and technical issues are part of day to day operations and that can delay your training flights.
How much does flight training cost?
Tuition fee would generally be around 50,000$ to 70,000$+ depending on the flight school of choice. Total expenditure would vary from the country you have chosen to study as students have to bare for travel costs, living costs, visa and etc apart from the tuition fee.
How can i fund for pilot training?
if you does not have the capability to self fund for the pilot course you can opt to obtain student pilot loans.
Ministry of higher education of Maldives offers pilot training opportunities for students as part of loans and scholarships programs for students. They provide the opportunity for 5 - 20 students each time. You can apply for the loan and if you are selected they would provide student loan for pilot course at countries where they allow students to attain training. You can also get yourself a student loan directly from Bank of Maldives if you meet the requirement criteria for the student loan eligibility.
What are the medical requirements?
Being an airline pilot is often considered among the most stressful jobs in the world so your health is a very important factor for a long prosperous career. In order to legally operate as an airline pilot in the Maldives you are required to hold a Class 1 medical license. As student pilots you will have to obtain an aviation medical license from the issuing authority of the country of the flight school you have enrolled before you can commence your flight training.
Generally in medical licenses checks they would be conducting an eye test ( sight tests, color vision tests ), Hearing tests, Electrocardiogram tests (to check the functioning of your heart muscle), blood tests, urine tests, and general physique.
If you have a condition that you think that may affect your medical license you can get advise from an aviation medical doctor active in hospitals and clinics in Maldives. Aviation medical doctors are present in Male' and in Addu.</span></div></div>

		Data Construction Workflow

</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="/datasets/m-a-p/FineFineWeb/blob/main/assets/finefineweb-data-workflow.png"><img alt="finefineweb-data-workflow" src="/datasets/m-a-p/FineFineWeb/resolve/main/assets/finefineweb-data-workflow.png"></a></p>
<p>The data construction workflow can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deduplicate</strong>: The FineWeb dataset is deduplicated using exact deduplication and MinHash techniques to remove redundant data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>URL Labeling</strong>: Root URLs from FineWeb are counted, and the top 1 million URLs are labeled using <strong>GPT-4</strong>. This step generates <strong>DoI (Domain-of-Interest) Coarse-Grained URLs</strong> and <strong>DoNI (Domain-of-Non-Interest) Coarse-Grained URLs</strong> as seed data sources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Coarse Recall</strong>:</p>
<p> a. Based on the labeled root URLs, data is sampled for each domain.</p>
<p> b. The sampled data is labeled using <strong>Qwen2-7B-Instruct</strong>, producing 500K <strong>DoI Positive Data</strong> and 500K <strong>DoI Negative Data</strong> (note that for N&gt;1 iterations, each 500K samples are composed of 250K sampled original seed data and 250K refined data after Fine Recall).</p>
<p> c. A binary <strong>FastText</strong> model is trained per domain using the labeled data.</p>
<p> d. The FastText model performs <strong>coarse recall</strong> on FineWeb, generating <strong>Coarse DoI Data</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fine Recall</strong>:</p>
<p> a. The <strong>Coarse DoI Data</strong> is labeled using <strong>Qwen2-72B-Instruct</strong> to produce <strong>100K DoI Positive Data</strong> and <strong>50K DoI Negative Data</strong>, with the latter further augmented with 50K negative samples from earlier FastText training.</p>
<p> b. A <strong>BERT</strong> model is trained using this labeled data.</p>
<p> c. The BERT model performs <strong>fine recall</strong> on the Coarse DoI Data, producing a refined dataset, which is the DoI subset of <strong>FineFineWeb</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Coarse-Fine Recall Iteration</strong>: The workflow of coarse and fine recall iterates for <strong>3 rounds</strong> with the following adjustments:</p>
<p> a. FastText is re-trained using updated seed data, which combines BERT-recalled samples, BERT-dropped samples, and previously labeled seed data.</p>
<p> b. The BERT model keeps frozen during subsequent iterations.</p>
<p> c. Steps for training FastText, coarse recall, and fine recall are repeated without re-labeling data with Qwen2-Instruct models.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>Perform proportional weighted sampling of the domain subsets based on the sample size of each domain, with a total of 1 billion tokens sampled from the domain subsets.</li>
<li>Use the BGE-M3 model to compute the embeddings of the samples in each domain subset, referred to as domain embeddings.</li>
<li>Use the BGE-M3 model to compute the embeddings of the samples in each benchmark, referred to as benchmark embeddings (bench embeddings).</li>

<p>The results above reveal the following observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The two code-related benchmarks, MBPP and HumanEval, exhibit relatively large distances from nearly all domains, indicating that the proportion of code data in the training set is relatively small. Notably, their distance to the mathematics domain is comparatively smaller, suggesting a certain degree of overlap between mathematics data and code data.</li>
<li>Benchmarks such as Hellaswag, ARC, MMLU, and BoolQ have distances that are close to almost all domains, except for the gamble domain. This indicates that the samples in these benchmarks involve synergetic effects across multiple domains of knowledge, with a wide distribution.</li>
<li>GSM8K and TriviaQA show significant discrepancies with a small number of domains, suggesting that the distribution differences between domains are more pronounced for samples involving grade-school mathematics and fact-based question answering. Some domains contain a substantial amount of this type of data, while others do not.</li>
<li>The gamble domain exhibits substantial differences from other domains and has large distances from all benchmarks, indicating that pretraining data related to gambling provides limited benefits for these benchmarks.</li>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="/datasets/m-a-p/FineFineWeb/blob/main/assets/duplication.png"><img alt="domain-domain URL duplication" src="/datasets/m-a-p/FineFineWeb/resolve/main/assets/duplication.png"></a></p>
<p>Using the TF-IDF values of all URLs within a domain, the domain-domain duplicate rate can be analyzed by comparing the <strong>distribution</strong> of TF-IDF values across domains. If a domain has many URLs with <strong>high TF-IDF values</strong>, it indicates that the domain’s URLs are relatively <strong>unique</strong> and significant within the entire set of URLs. Conversely, if a domain has many URLs with <strong>low TF-IDF values</strong>, it suggests that the domain's URLs are more <strong>common</strong> across other domains. Analyzing these values helps assess how similar or redundant a domain's content is in relation to others based on its URL composition.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, most domains have low duplication rates, except for topicality, pet, and atmospheric science.</p>
