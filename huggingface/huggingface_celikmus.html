Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, and an inability to move the bowels despite the urge to do so. This is called tenesmus.\nLeft-sided colitis. Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending portions of the colon. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain on the left side, and urgency to defecate.\nPancolitis. This type often affects the entire colon and causes bouts of bloody diarrhea that may be severe, abdominal cramps and pain, fatigue, and significant weight loss.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ulcerative-colitis&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary somewhat by age of onset.

Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms â€” including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that most people who see a health care provider for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead. Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light â€” all common features of migraines. Sinusitis usually: \nOccurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold\nIncludes thick, discolored nasal mucus\nIs associated with a decreased sense of smell\nCauses pain in one cheek or upper teeth \n Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer, and migraines most commonly last hours to a day or two.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;sinus-headaches&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:10,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes.

In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include: \nRed meat, such as beef, pork or lamb.\nOrgan meats.\nProducts made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.\n Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: \nHives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin.\nSwelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts.\nWheezing or shortness of breath.\nStomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.\n The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;alpha-gal-syndrome&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Signs and symptoms of lupus nephritis include: \nBlood in your urine\nFoamy urine (due to excess protein in urine)\nHigh blood pressure\nSwelling in your hands, ankles or feet\nHigh levels of a waste product called creatinine in your blood\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;lupus-nephritis&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about seven to 10 days for signs and symptoms to appear, though it can sometimes take longer.

Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.\nStomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis. The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus.\nDehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect.\nChanges in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.\nWeight problems.

Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops. Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with: \nFemale genitals\nGenitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals)\nUnderdeveloped male genitals\n Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper: \nDevelopment of muscle mass\nVoice deepening\nGrowth of body and facial hair\nGrowth of the penis and testicles\n And it can cause: \nExcessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body\nDevelopment of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include: \nDecreased sex drive\nDecreased energy\nDepression\n Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop: \nErectile dysfunction\nInfertility\nDecrease in hair growth on the face and body\nDecrease in muscle mass\nDevelopment of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\nLoss of bone mass (osteoporosis)\n Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include: \nDifficulty concentrating\nHot flashes\n When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism.

They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. \nBipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).\nBipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.\nCyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years â€” or one year in children and teenagers â€” of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).\nOther types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.\n Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: \nAbnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired\nIncreased activity, energy or agitation\nExaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)\nDecreased need for sleep\nUnusual talkativeness\nRacing thoughts\nDistractibility\nPoor decision-making â€” for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments\n Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: \nDepressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)\nMarked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all â€” or almost all â€” activities\nSignificant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)\nEither insomnia or sleeping too much\nEither restlessness or slowed behavior\nFatigue or loss of energy\nFeelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt\nDecreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness\nThinking about, planning or attempting suicide\n Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;bipolar-disorder&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:36,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer.

When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include: \nIncreasing pain\nA growing lump or area of swelling\nWeakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord\n Causes It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include: \nIncreasing age. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age.\nOther bone diseases. Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body.

The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called \&quot;blackouts,\&quot; where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.\nAlcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.\n What is considered 1 drink?

Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include: \nA misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected\nDevelopment of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical\n Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: \nSagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis.\nCoronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward.\nMetopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly.\nLambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.\n Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;craniosynostosis&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:92,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma include: \nYellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)\nIntensely itchy skin\nWhite-colored stools\nFatigue\nAbdominal pain on the right side, just below the ribs\nLosing weight without trying\nFever\nNight sweats\nDark urine\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;cholangiocarcinoma&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In most cases, no signs or symptoms of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia exist until you're exposed to certain drugs used for anesthesia.

The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include: \nIntense joint pain. Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.\nLingering discomfort. After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.\nInflammation and redness. The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.\nLimited range of motion. As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gout&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alcohol poisoning signs and symptoms include: \nConfusion\nVomiting\nSeizures\nSlow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)\nIrregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)\nBlue-tinged skin or pale skin\nLow body temperature (hypothermia)\nPassing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened\n When to see a doctor It's not necessary to have all the above signs or symptoms before you seek medical help. A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning â€” even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms â€” seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do: \nCall 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning.\nBe prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when.\nDon't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke.\nHelp a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side â€” this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness.\n Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution. You may worry about the consequences for yourself or your friend or loved one, particularly if you're underage. But the consequences of not getting the right help in time can be far more serious.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;alcohol-poisoning&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CCMs may exist without apparent symptoms. Seizures may occur when there is a CCM on the outer surface of the brain. CCMs CCM A wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur when CCMs are found in the brainstem, basal ganglia and spinal cord. For example, bleeding in the spinal cord may cause bowel and bladder symptoms or trouble with movement or feeling in the legs or arms. CCMs Generally, signs and symptoms of CCMs may include: CCMs \nSeizures\nSevere headaches\nWeakness in the arms or legs\nNumbness\nDifficulty speaking\nProblems with memory and attention\nProblems with balance and walking\nVision changes, such as double vision\n Neurological issues can progressively worsen over time with recurrent bleeding.

The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever. Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include: \nSweating\nChills and shivering\nHeadache\nMuscle aches\nLoss of appetite\nIrritability\nDehydration\nGeneral weakness\n Taking a temperature To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers. Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements. In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;fever&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Usually within the first year of life, growth of a child with progeria slows markedly, but motor development and intelligence remain normal.

 Most people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms. The course of ulcerative colitis may vary, with some people having long periods when it goes away. This is called remission. Types Health care providers often classify ulcerative colitis according to its location. Symptoms of each type often overlap. Types of ulcerative colitis include: 
Ulcerative proctitis. Inflammation is confined to the area closest to the anus, also called the rectum. Rectal bleeding may be the only sign of the disease.
Proctosigmoiditis. Inflammation involves the rectum and sigmoid colon â€” the lower end of the colon. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, and an inability to move the bowels despite the urge to do so. This is called tenesmus.
Left-sided colitis. Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending portions of the colon. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain on the left side, and urgency to defecate.
Pancolitis. This type often affects the entire colon and causes bouts of bloody diarrhea that may be severe, abdominal cramps and pain, fatigue, and significant weight loss.

 Sinusitis or migraine? Migraines and headaches from sinusitis are easy to confuse because the signs and symptoms of the two types of headaches may overlap. Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms â€” including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that most people who see a health care provider for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead. Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light â€” all common features of migraines. Sinusitis usually: 
Occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold
Includes thick, discolored nasal mucus
Is associated with a decreased sense of smell
Causes pain in one cheek or upper teeth 
 Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer, and migraines most commonly last hours to a day or two.</span></div></div>

Most reactions to common food allergens â€” peanuts or shellfish, for example â€” happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include: 
Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb.
Organ meats.
Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.
 Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: 
Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin.
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts.
Wheezing or shortness of breath.
Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.
 The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.</span></div></div>

Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months. Symptoms include: 
Vomiting after feeding. The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting might be mild at first. But over time, it becomes more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood.
Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.
Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis. The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus.
Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect.
Changes in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.
Weight problems. Pyloric stenosis can keep a baby from gaining weight, and sometimes can cause weight loss.

Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops. Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with: 
Female genitals
Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals)
Underdeveloped male genitals
 Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper: 
Development of muscle mass
Voice deepening
Growth of body and facial hair
Growth of the penis and testicles
 And it can cause: 
Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body
Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)
 Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include: 
Decreased sex drive
Decreased energy
Depression
 Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop: 
Erectile dysfunction
Infertility
Decrease in hair growth on the face and body
Decrease in muscle mass
Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)
Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)
 Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include: 
Difficulty concentrating
Hot flashes
 When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism. Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.</span></div></div>

 Vulva The vulva is the outer part of the female genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora and clitoris. The vulva is the outer part of the female genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora and clitoris. The main vulvodynia symptom is pain in your genital area, which can be characterized as: 
Burning
Soreness
Stinging
Rawness
Painful intercourse (dyspareunia)
Throbbing
Itching
 Your pain might be constant or occasional. It might occur only when the sensitive area is touched (provoked). You might feel the pain in your entire vulvar area (generalized), or the pain might be localized to a certain area, such as the opening of your vagina (vestibule). Vulvar tissue might look slightly inflamed or swollen. More often, your vulva appears normal. A similar condition, vestibulodynia, causes pain only when pressure is applied to the area surrounding the entrance to your vagina.</span></div></div>

They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. 
Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).
Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.
Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years â€” or one year in children and teenagers â€” of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).
Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.
 Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: 
Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired
Increased activity, energy or agitation
Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)
Decreased need for sleep
Unusual talkativeness
Racing thoughts
Distractibility
Poor decision-making â€” for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments
 Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: 
Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)
Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all â€” or almost all â€” activities
Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)
Either insomnia or sleeping too much
Either restlessness or slowed behavior
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide
 Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings.</span></div></div>

When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include: 
Increasing pain
A growing lump or area of swelling
Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord
 Causes It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include: 
Increasing age. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age.
Other bone diseases. Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body. These growths sometimes transform into chondrosarcoma.

An enlarged clitoris, which may resemble a penis
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and resemble a scrotum
Lumps that feel like testes in the fused labia
 Babies who are genetically male (with one X and one Y chromosome) may have: 
A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen (urethra) doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis (hypospadias)
An abnormally small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum

Intense itching on the scalp, body or in the genital area.
A tickling feeling from movement of hair.
The presence of lice on your scalp, body, clothing, or pubic or other body hair. Adult lice may be about the size of a sesame seed or slightly larger.
Lice eggs (nits) on hair shafts. Nits may be difficult to see because they're very tiny. They're easiest to spot around the ears and the nape of the neck. Nits can be mistaken for dandruff, but unlike dandruff, they can't be easily brushed out of hair.
Sores on the scalp, neck and shoulders. Scratching can lead to small red bumps that can sometimes get infected with bacteria.
Bite marks, especially around the waist, groin, upper thighs and pubic area.

It usually feels sharp or stabbing. However, some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain. Pericarditis pain usually occurs behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may: 
Spread to the left shoulder and neck
Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath
Get better when sitting up or leaning forward
 Other signs and symptoms of pericarditis may include: 
Cough
Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick
Leg swelling
Low-grade fever
Pounding or racing heartbeat (heart palpitations)
Shortness of breath when lying down
Swelling of the belly (abdomen)
 The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last. 
Acute pericarditis begins suddenly but doesn't last longer than three weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be difficult to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack.
Recurrent pericarditis occurs about four to six weeks after an episode of acute pericarditis with no symptoms in between.
Incessant pericarditis lasts about four to six weeks but less than three months. The symptoms are continuous.
Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months.

When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: 
Adults older than age 65
Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms
People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system
People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system
 For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.</span></div></div>

Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life. Physical defects Physical defects may include:

Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip
Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers
Slow physical growth before and after birth
Vision difficulties or hearing problems

When to see a doctorIf you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help.
Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help.
If you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant â€” and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.

Pelvic pressure or pain
Frequent urination
Difficulty emptying the bladder

Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing
Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft
Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle
 Features People with kleptomania usually have these features or characteristics: 
Unlike most shoplifters, people with kleptomania don't compulsively steal for personal gain, on a dare, for revenge or out of rebellion. They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it.
Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person.
Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party.
Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them.
The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen.
Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time.

Red rash. The rash looks like a sunburn and feels like sandpaper. It typically begins on the face or neck and spreads to the trunk, arms and legs. Pushing on the reddened skin makes it turn pale.
Red lines. The folds of skin around the groin, armpits, elbows, knees and neck usually become a deeper red than the other areas with the rash.
Flushed face. The face may appear flushed with a pale ring around the mouth.
Strawberry tongue. The tongue generally looks red and bumpy, and it's often covered with a white coating early in the disease.
 Signs and symptoms of scarlet fever also include: 
Fever of 100.4 F (38.0 C) or higher, often with chills
Very sore and red throat, sometimes with white or yellowish patches
Difficulty swallowing
Enlarged glands in the neck (lymph nodes) that are tender to the touch
Nausea or vomiting
Belly (abdominal) pain
Headache and body aches
 The rash and the redness in the face and tongue usually last about a week. After these signs and symptoms have gone away, the skin affected by the rash often peels.</span></div></div>

They may include: 
Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events
Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes
Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't
Difficulty handling uncertainty
Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision
Inability to set aside or let go of a worry
Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge
Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind "goes blank"
 Physical signs and symptoms may include: 
Fatigue
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tension or muscle aches
Trembling, feeling twitchy
Nervousness or being easily startled
Sweating
Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome
Irritability
 There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age. Symptoms in children and teenagers Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about: 
Performance at school or sporting events
Family members' safety
Being on time (punctuality)
Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events
 A child or teen with excessive worry may: 
Feel overly anxious to fit in
Be a perfectionist
Redo tasks because they aren't perfect the first time
Spend excessive time doing homework
Lack confidence
Strive for approval
Require a lot of reassurance about performance
Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints
Avoid going to school or avoid social situations
 When to see a doctor Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if: 
You feel like you're worrying too much, and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life
You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety
You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors â€” seek emergency treatment immediately
 Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe â€” it may be easier to treat early on.</span></div></div>

The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism symptoms may include: 
Tiredness.
More sensitivity to cold.
Constipation.
Dry skin.
Weight gain.
Puffy face.
Hoarse voice.
Coarse hair and skin.
Muscle weakness.
Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness.
Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular.
Thinning hair.
Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia.
Depression.
Memory problems.
 Hypothyroidism in infants Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include: 
Feeding problems.
Poor growth.
Poor weight gain.
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice.
Constipation.
Poor muscle tone.
Dry skin.
Hoarse crying.
Enlarged tongue.
A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.
 When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems. Hypothyroidism in children and teens In general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. But they also may have: 
Poor growth that leads to short stature.
Delayed development of permanent teeth.
Delayed puberty.
Poor mental development.

Signs and symptoms may include: 
Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use
Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use
Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol
Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming
Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms â€” such as nausea, sweating and shaking â€” when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms
 Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal. 
Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called "blackouts," where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.
Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.
 What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: 
12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol)
8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol)
5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol)
1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol)

 Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys can make up for lost function, signs and symptoms might not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. When to seek care Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your care provider is likely to monitor your kidney function with urine and blood tests and your blood pressure during regular office visits. Ask your provider whether these tests are necessary for you.</span></div></div>

Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include: 
A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected
Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical
 Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: 
Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis.
Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward.
Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly.
Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.
 Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance.</span></div></div>

 Gout Gout causes intense pain and swelling around one or more joints. Gout most commonly affects the joint at the base of the big toe. Gout causes intense pain and swelling around one or more joints. Gout most commonly affects the joint at the base of the big toe. The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include: 
Intense joint pain. Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.
Lingering discomfort. After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.
Inflammation and redness. The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.
Limited range of motion. As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.

Confusion
Vomiting
Seizures
Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)
Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)
Blue-tinged skin or pale skin
Low body temperature (hypothermia)
Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened
 When to see a doctor It's not necessary to have all the above signs or symptoms before you seek medical help. A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning â€” even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms â€” seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do: 
Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning.
Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when.
Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke.
Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side â€” this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness.
 Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution. You may worry about the consequences for yourself or your friend or loved one, particularly if you're underage. But the consequences of not getting the right help in time can be far more serious.</span></div></div>

The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever. Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include: 
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
 Taking a temperature To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers. Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements. In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.</span></div></div>
