He has been taking high-dose vitamin D supplements due to a previous diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. Laboratory results reveal hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. What is the likely diagnosis, and what is the treatment?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's history of recurrent kidney stones, osteopenia, and high-dose vitamin D supplementation, along with laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, suggest the possibility of vitamin D toxicity. Excessive intake of vitamin D can cause increased absorption of calcium from the gut, leading to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, which can result in kidney stones and bone loss. Treatment would involve stopping the vitamin D supplementation and potentially providing intravenous fluids and loop diuretics to promote the excretion of calcium.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 7-year-old boy presents with a fever, headache, and severe earache. He also complains of dizziness and a spinning sensation. Examination reveals a red, bulging tympanic membrane. What are the differential diagnoses, and what should be done next?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This child's symptoms of a red, bulging tympanic membrane with systemic symptoms such as fever and headache, and the additional symptoms of dizziness and a spinning sensation, raise concern for complications of acute otitis media. The differential diagnosis could include labyrinthitis or possibly even mastoiditis. Urgent evaluation, including further imaging studies such as a CT or MRI scan, may be necessary. This child likely requires admission for intravenous antibiotics and possibly surgical intervention if mastoiditis is confirmed.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old woman presents with a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. She is initially suspected of having asthma, but her spirometry results do not improve with bronchodilators. What could be the diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While the symptoms might initially suggest asthma, the lack of response to bronchodilators indicates a different cause. A possible diagnosis in this case might be idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a type of lung disease that results in scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs for an unknown reason. High-resolution CT of the chest would be the next step in diagnosis.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old male presents with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. He has a history of long-standing hernia. On examination, the hernia is tender, firm, and non-reducible. What's the likely diagnosis and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms suggest an incarcerated hernia with suspected bowel obstruction. This requires urgent surgical consultation for potential hernia reduction and repair. If the incarcerated tissue cannot be reduced or if there is suspicion of strangulation (compromised blood supply), an emergency surgery is required to prevent tissue necrosis.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A newborn baby presents with eye redness and a thick purulent discharge in both eyes. The mother has a history of untreated chlamydia. What could be the cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The infant's symptoms suggest neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum), likely due to maternal transmission of Chlamydia trachomatis during delivery. Urgent ophthalmological evaluation is necessary, and systemic antibiotics are usually required.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old male with obesity presents with chronic knee pain, which is worse with activity and relieved by rest. Physical examination reveals knee joint tenderness and crepitus with movement. What is the likely diagnosis and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are indicative of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, a condition often associated with obesity due to increased mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints. To confirm the diagnosis, an X-ray of the knee may be ordered, which could show joint space narrowing and osteophytes, characteristic of OA. The treatment would involve weight loss, physical therapy, pain management with NSAIDs, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 60-year-old female presents with high fever, confusion, and seizures.

What could be the potential diagnosis and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Her symptoms suggest cerebral malaria, a severe form of Plasmodium falciparum malaria that affects the brain and can cause altered consciousness, seizures, and neurological abnormalities. This is a medical emergency. Immediate confirmation of diagnosis with a blood smear or RDT is required, and if confirmed, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for parenteral antimalarial treatment and supportive care.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 58-year-old male with a history of smoking and high cholesterol presents with complaints of chest pain that occurs during exertion and is relieved by rest. He rates the pain as a 6/10 and states it feels like \&quot;pressure\&quot; in his chest. An EKG reveals ST depressions during an episode of pain. What is the likely diagnosis, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's presentation of exertional chest pain relieved by rest is consistent with stable angina, likely due to coronary artery disease from atherosclerosis. The ST depressions on the EKG during an episode of pain suggest myocardial ischemia. The next step would include further evaluation of his coronary arteries, likely with a stress test, and beginning medical management for angina and atherosclerosis.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents with sudden onset of difficulty swallowing and hoarseness. He also complains of dizziness and unsteady gait. On examination, he has a hoarse voice, decreased gag reflex, and loss of temperature sensation on the right side of the face and left side of the body. What is your primary concern and what would be the next step?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest a type of stroke known as lateral medullary syndrome or Wallenberg's syndrome, which involves the medulla of the brainstem. Immediate actions should include stabilizing the patient, followed by neuroimaging with a CT scan and possibly an MRI to confirm the diagnosis.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 60-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presents with new onset of joint pain and morning stiffness in her hands. She mentions that she started on a new medication for her cancer two months ago. What could be the potential cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In a patient with a history of breast cancer who is on medication, it is important to consider aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Aromatase inhibitors, a treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, can cause joint pain and stiffness, mimicking the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. If the symptoms significantly affect her quality of life, her oncologist may consider switching to another type of medication, if possible.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:10,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A newborn boy has multiple congenital anomalies including cleft palate, low-set ears, and clenched hands with overlapping fingers. He also has heart defects. Chromosomal analysis reveals a karyotype of 47,XY,+18. What might be the diagnosis and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The boy's chromosomal analysis showing 47,XY,+18 suggests Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. The presence of cleft palate, low-set ears, clenched hands with overlapping fingers, and heart defects further supports this diagnosis. The next steps would include an echocardiogram to evaluate the extent of heart defects, and a consultation with a geneticist for counseling regarding the prognosis and potential challenges associated with this syndrome.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old woman arrives with a puncture wound on her hand caused by a cat bite. The wound is small but deep, with surrounding erythema. What is the plan of action?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cat bite wounds, particularly on the hand, are notorious for developing infections due to deep puncture and the specific bacteria in a cat's mouth, including Pasteurella multocida. The wound should be irrigated and cleaned thoroughly, but suturing should generally be avoided due to the high risk of infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy, typically with amoxicillin-clavulanate, should be initiated. If signs of infection worsen or spread, or if the patient becomes systemically unwell, urgent medical review is needed.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old male with schizophrenia is noted to have stiffness, shuffling gait, and a resting tremor. He has been on risperidone for the past eight years. What could be causing these symptoms, and what would be the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest parkinsonism, which is likely due to the long-term use of risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms. Options include reducing the dosage of risperidone, switching to an antipsychotic with a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects, or adding an anticholinergic medication to manage the parkinsonian symptoms.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 48-year-old woman presents with an episode of heavy menstrual bleeding. She reports that her periods have been irregular for the past year, and she occasionally experiences hot flashes. What could be the potential causes and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient is likely in perimenopause, which can cause irregular menstrual cycles and heavy bleeding. However, other causes such as fibroids or endometrial hyperplasia should be ruled out. The next step would be to conduct a pelvic ultrasound and possibly an endometrial biopsy depending on the results.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old male with a history of cystic fibrosis presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His blood tests show elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes. What could be the diagnosis and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient likely has acute pancreatitis, which can be associated with cystic fibrosis due to the thick, sticky mucus obstructing the pancreatic duct. Further diagnostic evaluation could include imaging studies such as an ultrasound or CT scan to assess the pancreas. Management typically involves hydration, pain management, and treating the underlying cause, which in this case may include therapies to improve mucus clearance.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 10-year-old girl presents with a sore throat, fever, and painful swallowing. On examination, her tonsils are red and swollen, and she has enlarged and tender cervical lymph nodes. A rapid strep test is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis and treatment plan?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The combination of sore throat, fever, painful swallowing, swollen tonsils, and a positive rapid strep test strongly suggests streptococcal pharyngitis, or \&quot;strep throat\&quot;, which often involves tonsillitis. The treatment is typically a 10-day course of antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, to eliminate the bacteria and prevent complications such as rheumatic fever or kidney disease.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old woman with obesity complains of dull aching pain in her right lower leg. Physical examination reveals skin changes with brownish discoloration and edema. What could be the potential diagnosis and management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition often seen in individuals with obesity due to increased pressure in the leg veins. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a duplex ultrasound to assess blood flow and vein function. Management would include weight loss, leg elevation, compression stockings, and potentially procedures to improve venous circulation.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old man with a history of osteoporosis presents with sudden onset back pain after lifting a heavy object. He has no radiating pain or neurological symptoms. What is the likely diagnosis and what should be the next step?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given the patient's age, history of osteoporosis, and mechanism of injury, this could be a vertebral compression fracture. This is a common type of fracture in people with osteoporosis. The next step would be to obtain X-rays of the spine, and possibly a CT or MRI for further assessment. Most of these fractures can be managed conservatively with pain control and physical therapy, but more severe fractures or those causing neurological symptoms may require intervention such as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents with frequent nocturnal leg cramps. What should be the considerations?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's nocturnal leg cramps could have a variety of causes, and one possible factor to consider is Vitamin D deficiency. Although not typically considered as a primary cause, Vitamin D plays a role in maintaining proper muscle function, and deficiency has been associated with muscle cramps. Given his age and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which could also be indirectly influenced by Vitamin D status, it might be worth assessing his Vitamin D levels and considering supplementation.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old female presents with swelling, pain, and inability to bear weight on her left ankle following a fall during a basketball game where she landed awkwardly on her foot. The pain is on the outer side of her ankle. What is the likely diagnosis and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's history and symptoms are indicative of a lateral ankle sprain, one of the most common sports-related injuries. It occurs when the foot is inverted, causing damage to the lateral ligaments. The next step is a physical examination, including special ligamentous tests to confirm the diagnosis. An X-ray should also be done to rule out any associated fractures. Initial management would include rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) protocol and analgesia.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 40-year-old male taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation presents with increased bruising and blood in his stool. What could be the cause of his symptoms, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The symptoms described are consistent with potential over-anticoagulation from warfarin, causing increased bleeding and bruising. The patient should have his INR checked immediately. If his INR is elevated, warfarin may need to be withheld, and he may require treatment with vitamin K. It would also be important to assess for other sources of bleeding, such as a gastrointestinal bleed.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 40-year-old male with obesity presents with sudden onset of severe left-sided chest pain that radiates to his back. He also reports feeling lightheaded. His blood pressure is significantly higher on his right arm compared to his left. What are the potential diagnoses and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms, particularly the sudden onset severe chest pain and difference in blood pressure between arms, could suggest an aortic dissection, a serious condition that requires immediate attention. Obesity is a risk factor due to the associated hypertension. Immediate steps include a CT angiogram or an MRI to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, the patient would require hospitalization and likely surgery.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 65-year-old man with a history of CHD complains of chest pain occurring increasingly often and with less exertion than before. His current medications include aspirin, a statin, and a beta-blocker. His ECG is unchanged from previous. What could be the diagnosis and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest worsening stable angina, now becoming unstable. Unstable angina is part of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and denotes a worsening of previously stable coronary heart disease. The patient should be admitted to the hospital for monitoring and medical management, which may include increasing the dose of his beta-blocker, adding a long-acting nitrate or calcium channel blocker, and introducing a second antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel. He would also likely require further evaluation with a coronary angiogram.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old female complains of dry, scaly patches on the soles of her feet. She mentions that she frequently visits public swimming pools. The patches don't itch or burn. What could be the likely cause and treatment plan?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms and history suggest a moccasin-type athlete's foot, a variant of tinea pedis characterized by chronic dryness and scaling on the soles that may extend up the side of the foot. Treatment generally involves topical antifungal medication for mild cases, but for more stubborn infections, oral antifungal medication may be needed. The patient should also be advised to wear shower shoes or flip-flops in public pools and changing areas to avoid reinfection.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 40-year-old female with Bipolar Disorder has been stable on her medications. However, she is concerned about weight gain since starting treatment. How should this issue be addressed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Weight gain can be a side effect of many medications used in the treatment of Bipolar Disorder, including mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Addressing this issue involves a holistic approach that includes dietary counseling, encouraging regular physical activity, and regular monitoring of weight. In some cases, if weight gain is substantial and lifestyle changes aren't effective, the healthcare provider may consider switching to a weight-neutral medication.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old female presents with painless vaginal sores and swollen lymph nodes in the groin. She reports that she noticed the sores about two weeks after having unprotected sex. What might be the cause, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms of painless sores and swollen lymph nodes after unprotected sex suggest a diagnosis of primary syphilis. However, genital herpes and chancroid could also cause similar symptoms. A physical examination and swab from the sores for dark-field microscopy or PCR testing can confirm syphilis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, she should be treated with penicillin, and any sexual partners should be informed and tested.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old tennis player presents with elbow pain on the outer part of the joint. The pain worsens when he grips his racket or turns a doorknob. On examination, there is tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. What is the likely diagnosis, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are suggestive of lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as \&quot;tennis elbow.\&quot; This condition is a strain injury caused by overuse of the forearm muscles, leading to pain at the point where the muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow. Initial treatment includes rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers, and physiotherapy. A brace or strap might also help to reduce strain on the injured tissue. If these conservative measures do not alleviate symptoms, further treatments, such as corticosteroid injections or, rarely, surgery, may be considered.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old man presents with dyspepsia, weight loss, and a single episode of melena. He has a past medical history of peptic ulcer disease and atrial fibrillation, for which he takes warfarin. What are the potential diagnoses and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's dyspepsia, weight loss, and melena suggest upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from a peptic ulcer. Given his use of warfarin, an anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased. Initial management should include checking his INR and possibly reversing his anticoagulation depending on the severity of the bleeding. He should be started on a proton pump inhibitor, and emergent gastroenterology consultation should be obtained for upper endoscopy. Given his weight loss, biopsies to rule out malignancy might be considered depending on endoscopic findings.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis has an ultrasound that shows a hypoechoic mass in the liver. What could be the potential diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In a patient with a history of liver cirrhosis, a new hypoechoic mass on ultrasound raises a significant concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. Further characterization of the mass with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI would be helpful. If imaging is suggestive of HCC, a biopsy may not be necessary for diagnosis. The patient should be referred to a specialist for further management.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:29,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old male with chronic Hepatitis B presents with fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and loss of appetite. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly and ascites. Lab findings show significantly elevated liver enzymes. What are the potential causes and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms and findings may suggest decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis due to chronic Hepatitis B infection. Potential complications to consider include liver failure, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The next step would be further evaluation with imaging studies, such as a liver ultrasound or CT scan, and possibly a liver biopsy. He may need treatment with antiviral drugs, and in severe cases, may require a liver transplant.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old female presents with disorientation, dizziness, and vomiting. She recalls her drink tasting oddly at a bar before she started feeling ill. What could be the cause of her symptoms and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Her presentation could suggest drink spiking with substances such as GHB, Rohypnol, or Ketamine. These substances can cause symptoms like disorientation, dizziness, and vomiting. The next steps should be to stabilize the patient, monitor vital signs closely, manage symptoms, and obtain urine and blood samples for toxicology screening. It's also important to involve local law enforcement, as drink spiking is a criminal act.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old female with a known history of HIV infection presents with severe headaches and focal neurological signs. An MRI shows a single ring-enhancing lesion. What are the potential causes and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In an HIV-positive patient, a single ring-enhancing lesion raises suspicion for a brain abscess or a primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). To differentiate between these two conditions, further investigations such as a lumbar puncture and/or a biopsy might be needed. PCNSL typically occurs in individuals with CD4 counts below 50 cells/mm^3.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes presents with chronic pain, redness, and swelling in her right ankle. She also reports a recent history of non-healing ulcers on her right foot. What could be the diagnosis and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In a patient with long-standing diabetes presenting with chronic pain, redness, swelling, and a history of foot ulcers, Charcot foot (neuropathic osteoarthropathy) is a concern. This condition is a result of peripheral neuropathy leading to joint destruction, often triggered by a minor trauma or infection. The next steps should include obtaining an X-ray of the foot and ankle, which may reveal characteristic changes such as joint dislocation, fractures, or deformities. Management typically involves offloading the affected foot, treating any concurrent foot ulcer or infection, and maintaining good glycemic control.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 63-year-old man with Type 2 diabetes complains of tingling and burning sensations in his feet. He also mentions feeling like he's walking on cotton. What could be causing these symptoms and how should it be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest diabetic neuropathy, a complication of long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a detailed neurological examination. Management includes optimizing glycemic control to prevent further nerve damage, pain management (commonly with medications like pregabalin or gabapentin), and attention to foot care to prevent injuries and ulcers.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 32-year-old woman complains of persistent difficulties focusing at work, feeling restless, and often forgetting important deadlines. She also has trouble organizing tasks and prioritizing her duties. These issues have been causing significant stress and have affected her work performance. What could be causing these symptoms?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Although ADHD is commonly diagnosed in childhood, it can persist into adulthood or be diagnosed later in life. This woman's reported symptoms of persistent inattention, restlessness, forgetfulness, and difficulty with organization are consistent with Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation that includes obtaining a detailed history of symptoms and their impact on her life.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 77-year-old female with Parkinson's disease is feeling depressed and says she has lost interest in activities she used to enjoy. What could be the cause and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Depression is common in Parkinson's disease, due to both the physical challenges of the disease and changes in brain chemistry. This patient's symptoms suggest she may be experiencing depression. A referral to a mental health professional should be considered. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, along with antidepressant medications, has been shown to be effective in treating depression in Parkinson's disease.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:36,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 40-year-old female presents with postcoital bleeding and dyspareunia. She has no history of sexually transmitted infections and her last Pap smear two years ago was normal. What could be the potential causes and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Postcoital bleeding and dyspareunia could be due to a variety of causes, including cervical polyps, cervicitis, endometrial polyps, or malignancy. The patient should undergo a pelvic examination and a Pap smear if she hasn't had one recently. Based on these findings, further imaging or biopsy may be required.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old woman presents with symptoms of dysuria, frequency, and urgency. She mentions that these symptoms have been occurring repeatedly over the past six months, often following sexual intercourse. Urine cultures have been positive for E. coli in the past. What is the likely diagnosis, and what should be the approach to management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient likely has recurrent post-coital cystitis. As she's having frequent recurrences, she may benefit from post-coital prophylaxis: taking a single dose of an antibiotic such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after sexual intercourse. This strategy can be effective for women whose UTIs are consistently associated with sexual activity.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old male presents with gradual onset of right shoulder pain that's worse at night and interrupts his sleep. He describes the pain as deep and aching. He's unable to lie on the affected shoulder and has noticed progressive weakness when lifting objects. On examination, he demonstrates pain and weakness with active abduction of the arm, especially between 60 and 120 degrees. What could be the diagnosis and plan?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms of deep, aching shoulder pain, nocturnal pain, weakness with lifting, and painful arc during abduction suggest a rotator cuff tear. The next step would be to obtain imaging, such as an ultrasound or MRI, to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the severity of the tear and the patient's functional needs. Conservative management includes physical therapy, pain control with NSAIDs, and possibly corticosteroid injections. Surgery may be considered in cases of severe or full-thickness tears, or if conservative management fails.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old woman presents with chest pain that she describes as a heavy pressure. The pain occurs at rest and lasts about 20 minutes. She has a history of similar episodes over the past week. What kind of angina could this be, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;These symptoms are characteristic of unstable angina. Unlike stable angina, unstable angina occurs unpredictably, often at rest, and episodes can last longer. Unstable angina is a medical emergency, as it may precede a heart attack. The next steps should include hospital admission, continuous ECG monitoring, and treatment with medications such as nitroglycerin, beta-blockers, and anticoagulants.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old female presents with sudden severe abdominal pain, dizziness, and a positive home pregnancy test. She is tachycardic, and her blood pressure is dropping. What are the potential causes and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms, along with a positive pregnancy test, raise concerns about a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition where the pregnancy implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Immediate steps include stabilizing the patient, starting intravenous fluids, and obtaining a stat ultrasound to identify the location of the pregnancy. If a ruptured ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, emergency surgery is necessary.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:41,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old woman presents with pain and inability to move her left thumb after falling onto an outstretched hand during a skiing accident. The thumb appears deformed and is swollen. What is the likely diagnosis and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The presentation suggests a thumb dislocation, likely at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. This injury is often caused by forceful hyperextension of the thumb. An X-ray should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and identify any associated fractures. The joint should be reduced as soon as possible, often under local anesthesia due to the pain, and then immobilized with a thumb spica splint.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 12-year-old boy twisted his ankle during a soccer game.

What is the likely diagnosis and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This presentation is suggestive of an ankle dislocation. Given the severe pain and inability to bear weight, associated fractures are likely, such as a bimalleolar or trimalleolar fracture. X-rays should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and identify any associated fractures. Ankle dislocations often require reduction under sedation or anesthesia, followed by immobilization with a cast or splint. Depending on the presence and extent of fractures, surgery might be required.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents with fatigue and difficulty breathing, particularly when lying flat.

What could be the potential causes and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of heart failure, most likely caused by her long-standing hypertension and diabetes. These conditions can lead to diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The next steps would include confirming the diagnosis with an echocardiogram and possibly performing a BNP test. Treatment would involve controlling her blood pressure and diabetes, managing her fluid status with diuretics, and potentially using medications like ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:44,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How do I fix the transmission in my car?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is an automotive question, which is outside of my expertise as a medical and psychological AI model.

What's the likely explanation?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Humans do not have the biological capacity to lay eggs. The perception of doing so could be related to a misunderstanding of normal bowel movements or possibly even a hallucination. If the belief persists, it may be appropriate to conduct a psychological evaluation.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:46,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old man presents with lower back pain and stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with activity.

What is the probable diagnosis, and what are the management options?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms suggest Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a subtype of major depressive disorder that follows a seasonal pattern. Common treatments for SAD include light therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy specifically tailored for SAD (CBT-SAD), and antidepressant medication. Lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and maximizing exposure to natural light can also be beneficial.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:50,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old female presents with new onset seizures. She has a history of sinusitis which was treated with a course of antibiotics by her primary care doctor a month ago. She also reports an intermittent headache over the past few weeks. CT scan reveals a cerebral abscess. What could be the cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The cerebral abscess in this patient is likely a complication from the recent sinusitis, which may not have been fully resolved with the course of antibiotics. Sinus infections can occasionally spread to the brain if not adequately treated. This patient will require hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and likely neurosurgical consultation for possible drainage of the abscess.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:51,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old man reports problems with maintaining an erection during sexual activity. He appears anxious and mentions that he worries a lot about his sexual performance. How could his symptoms be explained?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient seems to be experiencing performance anxiety, a common form of psychological or situational erectile dysfunction. Anxiety can initiate the release of adrenaline, a stress hormone that contracts blood vessels and can inhibit erections. Psychosexual counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and possibly short-term use of anti-anxiety medications can be considered to manage his symptoms.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:52,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 19-year-old female presents with anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and frequent nightmares after witnessing a violent crime. What could be the potential diagnosis and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient is displaying symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including re-experiencing the traumatic event through nightmares, difficulty sleeping, and increased anxiety. Referral to a mental health professional is crucial for further evaluation and treatment, which may include cognitive-behavioral therapy and potentially medication. Supportive care and reassurance are also important.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:53,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old male presents with a history of feeling 'down', having low energy, and difficulty concentrating every winter for the last five years. The symptoms usually start in the late fall and remit in the early spring. What is the likely diagnosis and recommended management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms suggest Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), specifically the winter subtype. This type of SAD is characterized by depression, low energy, and difficulty concentrating during the winter months. Treatment typically includes light therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and potentially medication such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Regular physical activity and a healthy diet can also help to manage symptoms.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:54,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 38-year-old male weightlifter presents with itchy, red circular lesions on his feet. The lesions have a clear center and a more active border. What is the likely diagnosis and how should this be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's description of itchy, red circular lesions with a clear center and active border suggests a form of tinea pedis, often referred to as \&quot;ringworm\&quot; of the foot due to its appearance. Treatment typically involves a topical antifungal medication applied for a few weeks. Patient education about good foot hygiene, including keeping the feet dry and clean, can help prevent recurrence.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:55,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 2-year-old child presents with a high fever, cough, and runny nose. His parents report that he seems less active than usual. How should this case be approached?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The child's symptoms could be due to influenza. Children can have more severe illness and are at higher risk for complications. Antiviral treatment should be considered for children with suspected or confirmed influenza, particularly if they are younger than 2 years or have chronic health conditions. In addition to antiviral therapy, the child should receive supportive care, including fluids and fever control. If there are any signs of severe illness, such as difficulty breathing or lethargy, the child should be evaluated promptly for possible hospitalization.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 24-year-old woman with schizophrenia presents with acute restlessness, fidgeting, and a feeling of being unable to sit still. She started taking aripiprazole two weeks ago. What could be the possible cause of these symptoms, and what is the recommended intervention?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest akathisia, a common side effect of antipsychotics like aripiprazole. Options for management include reducing the dosage of the antipsychotic, switching to another antipsychotic with a lower risk for akathisia, or adding a medication to treat the akathisia, such as a beta-blocker or benzodiazepine.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:57,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old female with a history of psoriasis presents with red, painful eyes and blurry vision. What could be the cause, and how should it be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms suggest possible uveitis, an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, which can be associated with psoriasis. It's crucial to refer this patient urgently to an ophthalmologist to prevent potential complications like glaucoma, cataract, or even vision loss. Treatment usually involves corticosteroid eye drops and, in severe cases, systemic medications.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old man with long-standing Ulcerative Colitis presents for routine follow-up.

What should be the next step in his management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given this patient's long-standing history of Ulcerative Colitis, he is at increased risk for colorectal cancer. The recommended surveillance for patients with UC involves colonoscopy with biopsies for dysplasia every 1-2 years after 8-10 years of disease. If he hasn't already, he should begin routine surveillance colonoscopies.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:59,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 45-year-old male with a history of gout presents with right ankle pain and swelling. He reports a recent increase in alcohol consumption. What are the potential diagnoses, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given the patient's history of gout and recent increase in alcohol consumption, which can precipitate gout attacks, this is likely a gout flare. However, other potential diagnoses should include trauma, other types of arthritis, or infection. Next steps should include a physical examination, blood tests for uric acid and inflammatory markers, and potentially an X-ray or other imaging of the ankle to rule out other causes of pain.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:60,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old male with a history of heart failure presents with shortness of breath. A cardiac ultrasound shows dilated ventricles with poor systolic function. What could be the potential diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The cardiac ultrasound findings of dilated ventricles with poor systolic function are indicative of dilated cardiomyopathy. This condition could be the result of multiple causes, including ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, or it could be idiopathic. Given the patient's age and history of heart failure, ischemic or valvular causes are most likely. Further investigations may include coronary angiography or cardiac MRI, and treatment should focus on managing heart failure and addressing any underlying causes.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:61,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old woman presents with recurrent nightmares and intrusive thoughts about a serious car accident she was in a year ago. She avoids driving and experiences significant distress when she sees car accidents on the news. She also seems to be constantly on edge and has difficulty sleeping. What could be the potential diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's recurrent, intrusive thoughts and nightmares about the accident, avoidance behavior, and hyperarousal symptoms are indicative of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD can occur after experiencing a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity related to the traumatic event.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:62,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;An 80-year-old female with a history of dementia living in a nursing home is brought in due to altered mental status. The nurse also reports a change in the smell and color of her urine. No fever or other specific symptoms are reported. What could be the potential diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Elderly patients, especially those with dementia, can present with atypical symptoms such as altered mental status when they have a UTI. The changes in the urine could also be indicative of a UTI. Lab testing, including urinalysis and urine culture, should be done to confirm the diagnosis. If a UTI is confirmed, appropriate antibiotics should be given based on the culture results.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:63,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 25-year-old male presents with intensely itchy blisters on his hands and feet. The blisters occasionally burst and leave behind patches of eroded skin. What could be the cause, and how should it be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms are suggestive of dyshidrotic eczema, a type of eczema characterized by blisters on the hands and feet. Treatment often includes high-strength topical steroids and measures to reduce itching, such as cold compresses and antihistamines. If severe, phototherapy or systemic therapies may be needed.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:64,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old woman presents with mood swings, irritability, and feelings of sadness. She also reports hot flashes and irregular periods. What is the likely diagnosis and treatment approach?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms suggest that she is in the perimenopause phase and might be experiencing mood changes related to hormonal fluctuations. Lifestyle changes, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and, in some cases, medication such as SSRIs or hormone therapy may be effective.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old male presents with fatigue, loss of libido, and depressed mood. He also complains of difficulty achieving an erection. On examination, he has decreased body hair and gynecomastia. What could be the cause, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest hypogonadism, a condition characterized by low testosterone levels. This could be due to primary testicular failure (primary hypogonadism) or dysfunction of the hypothalamus or pituitary (secondary hypogonadism). The next steps would be to measure morning testosterone levels, followed by additional tests such as LH, FSH, prolactin, and possibly a semen analysis, depending on the results. Treatment would depend on the underlying cause but may involve testosterone replacement therapy.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:66,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A patient presents with an abrasion on his ankle from a beach volleyball game. He asks if he can go swimming in the ocean. What advice should be given?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While saltwater itself isn't necessarily harmful to an abrasion, swimming in the ocean could expose the wound to bacteria, leading to potential infection. It's generally best to keep the wound clean and dry until it begins to heal. If he does choose to swim, he should clean the wound carefully afterwards, apply an antibiotic ointment if he has one, and cover it with a clean dressing.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:67,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 65-year-old woman presents with right knee pain that she describes as 'burning' and 'sharp.' She has been previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis in her knee. Her pain has recently worsened despite taking over-the-counter NSAIDs. What are the options for managing her symptoms?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If this patient's knee pain from osteoarthritis has worsened despite the use of NSAIDs, other pain management options could be considered. These include the use of topical NSAIDs or capsaicin, tramadol, or intra-articular corticosteroid injections. She might also benefit from physical therapy. If pain continues to impact her quality of life, surgical options such as total knee replacement might be considered.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 60-year-old female with a history of oral herpes presents with a headache, fever, confusion, and seizures. An MRI shows temporal lobe enhancement. What is the likely diagnosis, and what is the appropriate management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The symptoms and imaging findings are suggestive of herpes simplex encephalitis, a serious condition most commonly caused by HSV-1. Immediate treatment with intravenous acyclovir is necessary, and supportive care may be required for seizures and other symptoms.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:69,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How can I train for a marathon?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While physical training and exercise are crucial for overall health, specific advice on marathon training goes beyond the scope of medical or psychological AI. A certified athletic trainer or a sports coach would provide better guidance.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:70,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old woman presents with redness, itching, and a burning sensation under her breasts. Examination reveals a well-demarcated, erythematous rash with scalloped edges and small pustules. What is the likely diagnosis and treatment plan?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This woman likely has intertrigo, a type of skin inflammation that can be caused by Candida. It often occurs in skin folds, like under the breasts, where it's warm and moist. The treatment typically includes a topical antifungal, sometimes combined with a mild corticosteroid to help with the inflammation and itching.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old man with a history of varicose veins presents with a painful, red, swollen left leg. He denies trauma or injury. On examination, the leg is warm to touch, and there are visible varicosities. What could be the potential cause, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's presentation of a painful, swollen, red leg could suggest a condition called superficial thrombophlebitis, where a blood clot forms in a vein near the surface of the skin. This condition is more common in individuals with varicose veins. The next steps would include a Doppler ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment typically includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain, warm compresses, and possibly anticoagulation therapy if the clot is close to the deep venous system. The patient should also be evaluated for risk factors for clot formation, such as malignancy or hypercoagulability.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 14-year-old boy with Type 1 Diabetes comes in for a routine visit. He mentions he's been feeling shaky, sweaty, and anxious, especially before meals. His blood glucose logs reveal multiple instances of pre-meal blood glucose levels below 70 mg/dL. What is the possible issue, and what is the next step?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This young boy's symptoms of shakiness, sweatiness, and anxiety, along with documented hypoglycemia, suggest he is experiencing episodes of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. This could be due to many factors, such as too high a dose of insulin, missed or delayed meals, or increased physical activity without adjusting insulin or carbohydrate intake. The next step would be to review his insulin regimen and his typical food and exercise routines, and then to make necessary adjustments to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis complains of increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, especially at the base of her thumbs. The pain is worse with use, such as when opening jars or turning keys. What is the likely cause and the treatment?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is likely symptomatic osteoarthritis of the thumb (also called thumb base arthritis or trapeziometacarpal arthritis), which is common in older adults, especially in those with a history of other forms of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis. Conservative management would be first-line, with options including thumb spica splinting, activity modifications, and NSAIDs for pain relief. If these measures are unsuccessful, intra-articular corticosteroid injections could be considered. Severe cases may require surgical intervention, such as arthroplasty or fusion.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 4-year-old boy with a history of recurrent ear infections presents with fever, ear pain, and a swollen, red area behind the right ear. On examination, the right ear appears to be pushed forward and downward. What is the potential diagnosis and appropriate treatment?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of mastoiditis, an infection of the mastoid process, which is often a complication of acute otitis media. This condition requires urgent medical attention. Treatment typically involves intravenous antibiotics and often surgical drainage.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:75,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 75-year-old woman seems to be losing her memory and getting confused easily. Her family also reports that she's been seeing things that aren't there. She's had a few falls recently. What could be the cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This combination of cognitive symptoms, visual hallucinations, and falls could suggest a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. This condition often presents with cognitive fluctuations, vivid visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism (movement symptoms like those seen in Parkinson's disease), which can include falls. An evaluation by a neurologist, including possible imaging studies, would be appropriate.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:76,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 68-year-old man with Type 2 diabetes reports increasing breathlessness on exertion. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. On examination, his feet are swollen. What are the potential causes and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), a common comorbidity in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia are all risk factors for CHF. An echocardiogram should be ordered to evaluate heart function. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels could also be helpful in diagnosing heart failure. Management includes addressing modifiable risk factors, initiating heart failure medications, and potentially referral to a cardiologist.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 2-year-old boy is brought to the clinic with a fever and tugging at his right ear. He has had a cold for the past week. On examination, his right tympanic membrane is red and bulging. What is the likely diagnosis and treatment?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This child's symptoms and physical findings are indicative of acute otitis media (AOM). Treatment typically involves pain control and, depending on the severity of symptoms and the child's age, may include antibiotics to combat the infection. Amoxicillin is often the first-line antibiotic of choice unless the child is allergic.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Can vitiligo lead to an increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, vitiligo can increase the risk of sunburn because the loss of melanin leaves the skin without its natural protection from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. However, vitiligo does not directly increase the risk of skin cancer. Nonetheless, because people with vitiligo are more prone to sunburn, they may have a slightly increased risk of skin cancer due to the potential for sun damage. It is important for individuals with vitiligo to take sun protection measures such as using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding peak sun exposure.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:79,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 55-year-old woman complains of leg discomfort at night that disrupts her sleep. She describes the sensation as \&quot;creepy-crawlies\&quot; moving up and down her legs. Her symptoms are relieved with movement. She has a history of iron-deficiency anemia. What could be causing her symptoms, and how should they be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Iron deficiency can contribute to RLS, and thus it's essential to treat this underlying condition. Oral iron supplements are typically recommended to increase ferritin levels. In addition, the patient might benefit from lifestyle modifications like regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and avoidance of caffeine. If these interventions do not alleviate her symptoms, she might require medications such as dopaminergic agents or gabapentin.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 6-month-old male infant is brought to the clinic by his parents who are concerned about his development. They state that he doesn't reach for objects, shows poor eye contact, and has abnormal jerky movements. His head circumference is significantly smaller than typical for his age. What could be a potential cause and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The infant's symptoms of developmental delay, poor eye contact, and abnormal movements, along with microcephaly, could suggest a rare genetic disorder known as Rett syndrome, which is usually caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene. However, it primarily affects females due to its X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. For males, similar symptoms might suggest a syndrome known as MECP2 duplication syndrome. The next step would involve genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis, which would guide future treatment and management plans.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:81,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old female presents with fatigue, pallor, and pica.

What could be the potential causes, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's presentation and lab results suggest microcytic anemia, which is most commonly due to iron deficiency anemia. This could result from inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption, or blood loss. The next step should be iron studies to confirm iron deficiency. If confirmed, it will be necessary to identify the source of blood loss, especially in menstruating women and all adult men.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:82,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A chest X-ray of a 55-year-old female with a history of breast cancer shows multiple small round opacities scattered throughout both lungs. What could be the possible cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The presence of multiple small round opacities in both lungs in a patient with a history of cancer is suggestive of metastatic disease, likely secondary to the breast cancer. The patient would typically be evaluated with a full-body imaging study like a CT scan or a PET scan to further characterize the extent of metastatic disease and guide treatment.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:83,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and feeling cold all the time. She also reports depression and dry skin. On examination, her reflexes are slow. What could be the cause, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms suggest hypothyroidism, a condition caused by insufficient production of thyroid hormone. This could be due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroidectomy, iodine deficiency, or certain medications. The next step would be to order thyroid function tests, including serum TSH and free T4 levels. If these tests confirm hypothyroidism, the patient would typically be treated with levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroid hormone.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:84,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 45-year-old man presents with symptoms of restlessness, irritability, concentration problems, and muscle tension. He recently survived a major earthquake and has been experiencing these symptoms since then, about a month ago. He is constantly on edge, expecting another disaster. What could be the potential diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms, which started after experiencing a major earthquake, are suggestive of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). ASD is characterized by the development of severe anxiety, dissociation, and other symptoms that occur within one month after exposure to an extreme traumatic event. The person has a persistently re-experiencing the traumatic event and is experiencing marked avoidance of stimuli that arouse recollections of the trauma.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 50-year-old man with a history of chronic Hepatitis B presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and dark urine. His Hepatitis B had been well controlled on entecavir. Lab tests show significantly elevated liver enzymes. What is the likely diagnosis and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient may be experiencing a flare of Hepatitis B, which can sometimes happen even on antiviral therapy, or potentially drug resistance. Another possibility is a superimposed liver disease such as alcoholic or autoimmune hepatitis. Further evaluation should include a Hepatitis B DNA level, antiviral resistance testing, and other tests for additional liver diseases based on the clinical context.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:86,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How can I restore an old wooden furniture piece?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Restoring wooden furniture is a task that falls outside the scope of a medical or psychological AI model. An experienced furniture restorer or carpenter would be better equipped to guide you through this process.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old woman presents with a new headache that she describes as being on one side of her head, primarily in the temple area. The headache is associated with tenderness over her temples and jaw claudication. She also reports blurred vision. What is the likely diagnosis and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's age, new headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms are concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. This is an emergency because untreated GCA can lead to blindness. The next steps should include an immediate ESR and CRP test, which are typically elevated in GCA, and start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment while awaiting biopsy confirmation to prevent further visual loss.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:88,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 58-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis presents with a new rash over her legs. She describes it as purple, flat spots that do not fade with pressure. She denies any new medications. What could be the cause, and what are the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's rash description is suggestive of vasculitis, specifically leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The inflammation of small vessels can lead to purpuric (purple) skin lesions, typically in the lower extremities. Next steps should include a skin biopsy for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, she may need additional immunosuppressive therapy and possibly consultation with a dermatologist or rheumatologist.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:89,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 60-year-old male presents with frequent episodes of flushing and diarrhea. Blood tests show elevated serotonin levels and increased 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA. What are the potential diagnoses and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;These symptoms and lab findings are suggestive of a carcinoid syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), typically found in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. The next steps would include imaging studies to locate the primary tumor (e.g., CT scan, MRI, or nuclear imaging like Octreotide scan or Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT), followed by a biopsy for histologic confirmation. Treatment usually involves surgery, somatostatin analogs, and potentially targeted therapies or systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:90,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease presents with excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. His wife reports that he often wakes up gasping for breath during the night. What could be causing these symptoms and what are the recommended steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are indicative of Sleep Apnea, which can be more common in individuals with Parkinson's disease due to the associated muscle rigidity and other autonomic dysfunction. The next step should be a formal sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. Management typically involves CPAP therapy, but any changes in his Parkinson's disease medication regimen should also be considered with the help of a neurologist.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:91,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 28-year-old male presents with fatigue, frequent nosebleeds, and red spots on his skin. His blood test results show a low platelet count, but his red and white blood cell counts are normal. What are the potential diagnoses and next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The symptoms of fatigue, nosebleeds, and skin changes (potentially petechiae), together with the low platelet count, could be indicative of a platelet disorder such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Other considerations include aplastic anemia, leukemia, or medication-induced thrombocytopenia. Further testing should include peripheral blood smear, coagulation tests, and possible bone marrow biopsy depending on these results.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:92,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 20-year-old male presents with severe itching on his scalp accompanied by flaking and redness. He has tried multiple dandruff shampoos but has found no relief. What could be the cause of his symptoms, and how can they be managed?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's symptoms are suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis, a type of eczema that typically affects sebum-rich areas like the scalp. Treatment typically involves medicated shampoos containing agents such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, or selenium sulfide. If the scalp eczema is severe, a short course of a low-potency topical steroid may also be necessary.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 52-year-old secretary complains of pain and swelling in her wrist, particularly on the side of her thumb. She also reports a sensation of \&quot;catching\&quot; or \&quot;snapping\&quot; when moving her thumb. What could be the issue?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms are suggestive of de Quervain's tenosynovitis, an inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It's often caused by overuse from repetitive hand or wrist movements, like typing.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:94,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 22-year-old male presents with severe pain in his left wrist after falling off a skateboard. The wrist is visibly deformed and swollen. What could be the diagnosis and plan?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The severe pain, visible deformity, and swelling suggest a possible wrist fracture, such as a distal radius fracture (commonly known as a Colles' fracture). This type of injury is common in falls onto an outstretched hand. Immediate management should include immobilization and pain control. An X-ray of the wrist should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the fracture. Depending on the severity and exact nature of the fracture, treatment could involve a cast or surgical intervention.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 45-year-old female reports that every time she coughs, she hears a \&quot;lion's roar\&quot; instead of the usual cough sound. She has no history of voice or throat issues. What might be the reason?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While coughs can sound different depending on the underlying cause, it's highly unlikely for a cough to resemble a \&quot;lion's roar.\&quot; This could be an exaggeration or a subjective perception of the sound. If the cough is persistent, it would be worthwhile to investigate common causes of chronic cough, such as asthma, postnasal drip, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 35-year-old female presents with muscle weakness in her arms and legs that has been getting worse over the past few weeks. She also reports occasional double vision. Neurological examination reveals proximal muscle weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes. What are the potential causes and the next steps?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient's symptoms and findings could suggest a neuromuscular disorder. Conditions such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, or a myopathy could present in a similar way. Further investigations should include blood tests for creatine kinase and acetylcholine receptor antibodies, nerve conduction studies, and possibly an electromyogram (EMG) or muscle biopsy, depending on the clinical suspicion.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 28-year-old female complains of pain and swelling at the back of her heel that increases while running. She is a long-distance runner and has increased her training regimen in preparation for a marathon. What could be the possible diagnosis?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given her activity level and the location of her symptoms, this patient is likely suffering from Achilles tendonitis, an overuse injury of the Achilles tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. It's common in runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their runs.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 70-year-old male with a history of smoking and high cholesterol complains of episodes of transient blindness in his right eye, describing it as a \&quot;curtain coming down\&quot; over his vision. These episodes last only a couple of minutes and then resolve spontaneously. What is the likely diagnosis, and what is the recommended management?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This patient is describing symptoms consistent with amaurosis fugax, which is a temporary loss of vision due to decreased blood flow to the eye, typically from an embolus. Given his history of atherosclerosis risk factors, the source is likely carotid artery disease. The patient should be evaluated with carotid duplex ultrasound to assess for carotid stenosis. Aspirin therapy should be started, and depending on the severity of stenosis, he may require a carotid endarterectomy or stenting.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A 30-year-old male complains of flatulence and loose stools after consuming milk-based coffee. He also admits he recently cut dairy from his diet for a couple of months due to a fad diet. What could be the potential cause?&quot;},&quot;Completion&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It's possible that this patient is experiencing lactose intolerance. While he may have tolerated lactose before, a significant reduction or elimination of lactose from the diet can reduce lactase levels in the body, leading to symptoms upon reintroduction of dairy. To confirm, a lactose tolerance test or hydrogen breath test can be conducted. If confirmed, the patient should be educated about lactose-containing foods and strategies for managing symptoms, which could include using lactase supplements or choosing lactose-free alternatives.&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:1412,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzEzNywic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0JJNTUvTWVkVGV4dCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjczNywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.b6jGsujH1faCVC_chLFBd9zwNdbXigU2HNzy3mui1KQxgnjlznXH4ZHjvFnbDnrrW6qqFdJuP5vq5uDIrldcDg&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;BI55/MedText&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;64bf913981caff7f18695d4a&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/d6d50bb19283f2873a39a295c903e335.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;L.

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>This is the shuffled version of medtext_1, so the datapoints are in random order and not sorted by category. This is to prevent catastrophic forgetting by category.</p>
<p>This is a medical diagnosis dataset containing over 1000 top notch textbook quality patient presentations and diagnosis/treatments. The 100 most common diseases and the 30 most common injuries people go to the hospital with, are, among others, fully captured in the dataset, with multiple datapoints for each ranging from mild to complicated to severe. Full list below. The dataset also contains completions about the nature of the AI itself, that it never can replace a doctor and always emphasizes to go to a professional and some nonsensical or doubtful presentations. A model trained on this dataset explicitly tells when it CANNOT answer with confidence or if the presentation is insufficient. This is to prevent hallucinations. </p>
<p>Medtext is a free to use (CC BY 4.0) dataset of over 1000 patient presentations and their diagnosis/treatment plans.
This is original data, converted into uniform datapoints using GPT-4.
We then pulled 10 random examples of the dataset and showed them to 3 different doctors, 2 of them involved and 1 of them uninvolved, and they all categorize the quality as â€žtextbook qualityâ€œ.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s content includes:</p>
<p>NOISE/DATA POLLUTION
*Dismissing of non-medical or non-psychological issues
*specifically asking for more information / admitting no possible diagnosis with confidence if insufficient data
*conflicting/contradicting and irrelevant information
*cases where symptoms are misleading to seemingly obvious diagnosis but actually being something different 
*information about the model (What are you? What can you do? Are you able to replace a doctor? This is to make the model humble and always emphasize that it can never replace a professional and it is just there to do some substitute analysis)</p>
<p>MISC
*emergency cases / first aid / almost fatal njuries that require emergency surgery
*injuries from crimes
*sexual injuries and STDs
*Infant specific cases
*Gynecological and urological cases
*genetic anomalies
*Previous medical mishandling
*Abuse/Overdosing/Misuse of drugs
*Cross side effects of drugs</p>
<p>ANALYSIS
*Textual analysis of blood tests, ultrasound, CT, MRI and X-ray examinations.</p>
