Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\\\&quot;Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\\n\\\&quot;.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;loss\&quot;: false,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;OK.
