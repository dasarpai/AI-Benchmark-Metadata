But at that time Newton published his personal notes, stating that he had applied the principle of calculus at least 10 years before Leibniz published his results. Newton also said that not long before Leibniz published his results, he talked about his thoughts on calculus in a letter to Leibniz. But the post-hoc research showed that in this letter from Newton, the few lines of calculus did not touch on any significance of this theory. Therefore, it can be concluded that Leibniz and Newton each independently invented calculus.</span></div></div>
