Alvarez, 2016 ONCA 259\n\nDATE: 20160408\n\nDOCKET: C59746\n\nMacPherson, MacFarland and LaForme JJ.A.\n\nBETWEEN\n\nHer Majesty the Queen\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nKeron Alvarez\n\nAppellant\n\nJonathan Dawe, for the\r\n    appellant\n\nKaren Papadopoulos, for the respondent\n\nHeard: April 5, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the conviction entered on November 29,\r\n    2013 by Justice Ian A. MacDonnell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting\r\n    without a jury.\n\nENDORSEMENT\n\n[1]\n\nThe trial judge convicted the appellant of 11 counts stemming from the\r\n    abduction of the complainant, namely: (i) uttering a threat (x2); (ii) assault\r\n    with a handgun; (iii) pointing a firearm (x2); (iv) forcible confinement; (v)\r\n    attempted murder; (vi) assault; and (vii) possession of a firearm contrary to a\r\n    prohibition order (x3). He was sentenced to a global term of imprisonment of 10\r\n    years less pre-trial custody.\n\n[2]\n\nAfter considering the complainantÂ’s evidence, together with all the\r\n    other evidence tendered by the Crown, the trial judge found the appellant and\r\n    his accomplice abducted the complainant at gunpoint as she walked home with her\r\n    boyfriend. He accepted that the complainant was dragged through alleyways and\r\n    held hostage in a nearby townhouse; that the appellant tried to shoot her but\r\n    his gun did not go off; and that the appellant and his accomplice beat her up.\n\n[3]\n\nFurther, the trial judge accepted that the appellant did all this to try\r\n    and start a fight with the complainantÂ’s boyfriend. And in fact, the appellant\r\n    did exchange gunfire with the boyfriend.\n\n[4]\n\nThe central issue at trial was identity. The appellant did not testify\r\n    and no defence evidence was called.\n\n[5]\n\nOn the appeal of his convictions, the appellant submits the trial judge\r\n    erred in two ways. First, he claims the trial judge failed to consider the\r\n    possibility that because the complainant had been exposed to an image of the\r\n    appellant, her identification evidence was contaminated. Second, he asserts\r\n    that the trial judge convicted the appellant of attempted murder by ignoring\r\n    potentially exculpatory evidence and/or exculpatory interpretations of the\r\n    evidence.\n\n[6]\n\nThe impact of the evidence of the complainant having viewed a You Tube video\r\n    of the appellant some five months after the abduction and prior to her viewing\r\n    his photo in the lineup was an issue for the trial judge to decide based on the\r\n    facts. When his reasons are read as a whole, it is clear he was alive to the\r\n    potential contamination from the You Tube video. It is equally clear that he\r\n    relied on other independent evidence to satisfy himself that the video did not\r\n    contaminate her identification evidence.\n\n[7]\n\nThe appellantÂ’s assertion that the trial judge may not have appreciated\r\n    the true nature of the problem is not supported by the record. In our view, and\r\n    consistent with the trial judgeÂ’s findings, any potential concerns raised by\r\n    the video are satisfied by the amount and quality of the one on one time the\r\n    complainant spent with the appellant.\n\n[8]\n\nThis case was not an identification case involving a fleeting glimpse of\r\n    a complete stranger. Here, the complainant had met the appellant for the first\r\n    time in her building a few months prior to the abduction, when he offered to\r\n    help her with her groceries. In addition, the night before her abduction, the\r\n    complainant witnessed Â“a brief but heatedÂ” argument between her boyfriend and\r\n    the appellant while in a Pizza Pizza restaurant.\n\n[9]\n\nFurthermore, during the events that gave rise to the criminal acts, the\r\n    complainant had on numerous occasions observed the appellant close up and even engaged\r\n    him in conversation. And, as she testified, she walked outside with the\r\n    appellant and remained beside him in the alleyway before, during and after the\r\n    gunfight.\n\n[10]\n\nFinally,\r\n    we note that the appellantÂ’s trial counsel did not raise the issue in his\r\n    closing submissions. This ground of appeal is dismissed.\n\n[11]\n\nWe\r\n    also reject the appellantÂ’s assertions that the trial judge misapprehended\r\n    evidence or failed to provide adequate reasons for convicting him of attempting\r\n    to murder the complainant.\n\n[12]\n\nFirst,\r\n    the trial judge specifically adverted to evidence of the other witness who said\r\n    he saw only one man. He found the difference between this evidence and that of\r\n    the complainant as being Â“no more than what one would expect given the\r\n    circumstances in which the observations of all of the witnesses, including [the\r\n    complainant], were made.Â” He was wholly entitled to reach this conclusion.\n\n[13]\n\nSecond,\r\n    the trial judge did not convict the appellant of attempt murder based only on\r\n    the complainantÂ’s subjective belief. Rather, he convicted him on an objective\r\n    assessment of all the evidence pointing to attempted murder, which included the\r\n    complainantÂ’s observations. He assessed her testimony on this issue together\r\n    with other facts he found that surrounded her account. The trial judge\r\n    concluded that the only reasonable inference is that the appellant Â“pointed the\r\n    gun at her head and pulled the trigger.Â”\n\n[14]\n\nFurthermore,\r\n    it is beyond dispute that the appellantÂ’s weapon was an operable firearm since\r\n    he had fired it moments earlier at her boyfriend. Thus, it was entirely open to\r\n    the trial judge to then find that when the appellant Â“pointed the gun at [the\r\n    appellantÂ’s] head and pulled the triggerÂ”, he expected to shoot her.\n\n[15]\n\nWe\r\n    find no error in either trial judgeÂ’s approach or his conclusions. We would\r\n    once again point out that trial judges are in the best position to make the\r\n    necessary findings of fact and are entitled to great deference. In doing so in\r\n    this case, the trial judge did not misapprehend evidence as argued by the\r\n    appellant and his reasons for his decision are more than adequate. The\r\n    conviction for attempt murder was reasonable.\n\n[16]\n\nFor\r\n    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n\nÂ“J.C.\r\n    MacPherson J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“J.\r\n    MacFarland J.A.Â”\n\n\&quot;H.S.\r\n    LaForme J.A.\&quot;\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2016&quot;},&quot;downloaded_timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;05-19-2022&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.ontariocourts.ca/coa/decisions_main&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\n\n\nWARNING\n\nThe President of the panel hearing this\r\n    appeal directs that the following should be attached to the file:\n\nAn order restricting publication in this\r\n    proceeding under ss. 486.4(1), (2), (2.1), (2.2), (3) or (4) or 486.6(1) or (2)\r\n    of the\nCriminal Code\nshall continue.Â  These sections of the\n\nCriminal\r\n    Code\nprovide:\n\n486.4(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subject to subsection (2),\r\n    the presiding judge or justice may make an order directing that any information\r\n    that could identify the victim or a witness shall not be published in any\r\n    document or broadcast or transmitted in any way, in proceedings in respect of\n\n(a)Â Â Â Â Â  any of the following offences;\n\n(i)Â Â Â Â Â Â  an offence under section 151,\r\n    152, 153, 153.1, 155, 159, 160, 162, 163.1, 170, 171, 171.1, 172, 172.1, 172.2,\r\n    173, 210, 211, 213, 271, 272, 273, 279.01, 279.011, 279.02, 279.03, 280, 281,\r\n    286.1, 286.2, 286.3, 346 or 347, or\n\n(ii)Â Â Â Â Â  any offence under this Act, as\r\n    it read at any time before the day on which this subparagraph comes into force,\r\n    if the conduct alleged involves a violation of the complainantÂ’s sexual\r\n    integrity and that conduct would be an offence referred to in subparagraph (i)\r\n    if it occurred on or after that day;

Greenspan and Naomi M. Lutes, for the respondent\n\nHeard: January 7, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice A.J.\r\n    Goodman of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated April\r\n    30, 2015.\n\nCronk J.A.:\n\n[1]\n\nFollowing a trial by judge alone, the respondent was acquitted of six sexual\r\n    offences involving two underage girls: two counts of sexual assault, two counts\r\n    of sexual interference, one count of invitation to sexual touching and one\r\n    count of obtaining for consideration the sexual services of a person under the\r\n    age of 18 years, all contrary to the\nCriminal Code\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46\r\n    (the Â“\nCode\nÂ”).\n\n[2]\n\nThe Crown appeals against the acquittals, except the acquittal on the\r\n    procuring offence. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Background\n\n[3]\n\nThe charges against the respondent arose out of incidents that occurred\r\n    on December 2, 2013, when the respondent, then 40 years of age, picked up two teenage\r\n    girls who were hitchhiking in Kitchener, Ontario. The girls were 14 and\r\n    one-half years old (V.T.) and 15 and one-half years old (A.S.) at the time.\n\n[4]\n\nWhile travelling in the respondentÂ’s vehicle, the complainants made\r\n    unsolicited, sexually suggestive comments and engaged in conversation with the\r\n    respondent about sex, partying, drinking and smoking. They claimed that they\r\n    had just attended a college party but had missed their ride home. They also\r\n    said that they were finished high school and, according to the respondent,\r\n    mentioned that they wanted to go somewhere warm and have Â“funÂ”.\n\n[5]\n\nThe respondent drove with the complainants to his parentsÂ’ home in\r\n    Kitchener.Â  After the consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, the\r\n    trio ended up in a hot tub in the backyard. While in the hot tub, A.S. and the\r\n    respondent engaged in fellatio and sexual intercourse. A short time later, the\r\n    respondent had sexual intercourse with V.T. in one of the bedrooms at the\r\n    house.\n\n[6]\n\nThe respondent then drove the girls to Cambridge. At their request, he\r\n    stopped to buy them cigarettes and then dropped them off at a local restaurant.\r\n    He also gave them $10 to buy something to eat.\n\n[7]\n\nAt trial, the\nactus reus\nof the offences charged was conceded.\r\n    There was no dispute that the parties had engaged in the sexual acts alleged\r\n    and that the complainants had participated willingly.Â  However, since both girls\r\n    were under the age of 16 years, as a matter of law, they could not consent to\r\n    the sexual acts. The primary issue at trial, therefore, was whether the\r\n    respondent could avail himself of the mistake of age defence as set out in s.\r\n    150.1(4) of the\nCode\n.Â  That section reads:\n\nIt is not a defence to a charge under section 151 or 152,\r\n    subsection 160(3) or 173(2), or section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused\r\n    believed that the complainant was 16 years of age or more at the time the\r\n    offence is alleged to have been committed\nunless the accused took all\r\n    reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the complainant\n. [Emphasis\r\n    added.]\n\n[8]\n\nIn essence, s. 150.1(4) allows a defence to certain types of sexual\r\n    activity with a complainant under the age of 16 years based on a mistake of\r\n    fact as to the complainantÂ’s age where the accused has taken all reasonable\r\n    steps to ascertain age. As the respondent was charged with offences under ss.\r\n    151, 152 and 271 of the\nCode\n, he could only satisfy s. 150.1(4) if, on\r\n    the trial judgeÂ’s findings, he honestly believed that the complainants were 16\r\n    years of age or more and his belief was honestly held because he had taken Â“all\r\n    reasonable stepsÂ” to ascertain their ages.\n\n[9]\n\nThe respondent testified.Â  He said that he honestly and mistakenly\r\n    believed the complainants had finished high school and were each 17 or 18 years\r\n    old. He maintained that, based on their appearance, actions and demeanour, and\r\n    the information they provided to him, he had taken all reasonable steps to\r\n    ascertain their ages.\n\n[10]\n\nThe trial judge found that A.S. was not a credible witness and that her\r\n    memory of certain events was unreliable. He also found that there were internal\r\n    and external inconsistencies in both her evidence and that of V.T. While he did\r\n    not accept the entirety of the respondentÂ’s testimony, he concluded that it\r\n    raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the respondent had taken all reasonable\r\n    steps in the circumstances to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages.\n\n[11]\n\nMore particularly, the trial judge held that, based on the complainantsÂ’\r\n    demonstrated actions, demeanour, self-professed stated objectives and portrayal\r\n    of themselves as older than their true ages on the night in question, along\r\n    with the total Â“constellation of factorsÂ”, the respondent was not required to make\r\n    further inquiries. He therefore concluded that the Crown had failed to meet its\r\n    burden to prove, to the requisite criminal standard, that the respondent did\r\n    not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. Accordingly,\r\n    he acquitted the respondent of all charges.\n\nII.Â  Â Â Â Â  Issues\n\n[12]\n\nThere are two issues on appeal:\n\n(1)\n\nHas\r\n    the Crown raised a question of law alone, entitling it to appeal from the\r\n    acquittals in question under s. 676(1)(a) of the\nCode\n?\n\n(2)\n\nDid\r\n    the trial judge err in his consideration of the mistake of age defence under s.\r\n    150.1(4) of the\nCod\ne?\n\nIII.Â  Â Â Â Â  PartiesÂ’ Positions\n\n(1)\n\nThe CrownÂ’s Argument\n\n[13]\n\nUnder s. 676(1)(a) of the\nCode\n, the CrownÂ’s right of appeal\r\n    from an acquittal is limited to Â“any ground of appeal that involves a question\r\n    of law aloneÂ”.\n\n[14]\n\nIn\nR. v. J.M.H.\n, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, the Supreme\r\n    Court of Canada identified four, non-exhaustive, categories of cases in which\r\n    alleged shortcomings in a trial judgeÂ’s assessment of the evidence constitute\r\n    an error of law, thereby allowing appellate review of an acquittal.Â  Justice Cromwell,\r\n    writing for the court, described these categories as follows, at paras. 25-32:\n\n1)\n\nit is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no\r\n    supporting evidence. However, a conclusion that the trier of fact has a\r\n    reasonable doubt is not a finding of fact for the purposes of this rule.\r\n    Rather, it is a conclusion that the standard of persuasion beyond a reasonable\r\n    doubt has not been met;\n\n2)\n\nthe legal effect of findings of fact or of undisputed facts may give\r\n    rise to an error of law;\n\n3)\n\nan assessment of the evidence based on a misapprehension or misdirection\r\n    concerning a legal principle is an error of law; and\n\n4)\n\na failure to consider all the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue\r\n    of guilt or innocence is also an error of law.\n\n[15]\n\nIn this case, the Crown acknowledges that, generally, the trial judge\r\n    correctly stated the legal test set out in s. 150.1(4) and correctly identified\r\n    the key principles underlying that provision. The Crown also accepts the trial\r\n    judgeÂ’s factual findings, as it is obliged to do on an appeal from an\r\n    acquittal.\n\n[16]\n\nHowever, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred by failing to draw\r\n    the correct legal conclusion from the facts he found, thus bringing this case\r\n    within the second category of cases identified in\nR. v.\n\nJ.M.H.\nas affording appellate review of an acquittal.\n\n[17]\n\nThe Crown contends that, on the facts as found by him, the trial judge\r\n    erred in law in concluding that a reasonable person in the respondentÂ’s\r\n    circumstances would not have made any specific inquiries or taken any active\r\n    steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. In other words, the Crown asserts\r\n    that the trial judge erred in articulating and applying the appropriate\r\n    standard of reasonableness against which the respondentÂ’s conduct should be\r\n    measured.\n\n[18]\n\nSpecifically, the Crown maintains that many of the indicia of age relied\r\n    on by the respondent to support his subjective belief that the complainants\r\n    were over 16 years of age, which were accepted by the trial judge as obviating\r\n    the need for further inquiry, were inconclusive and insufficient to lead a\r\n    reasonable person to conclude that no further inquiry was required.\n\n(2)\n\nThe RespondentÂ’s Argument\n\n[19]\n\nThe respondent counters with two arguments.\n\n[20]\n\nFirst, he argues that the Crown has not raised a question of law alone\r\n    upon which to appeal under s. 676(1)(a) of the\nCode\n. He says the trial\r\n    judgeÂ’s conclusion as to whether the Crown established that the respondent had failed\r\n    to take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages amounts to a determination\r\n    of the ultimate issue, namely, whether the Crown met its burden to establish\r\n    its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The CrownÂ’s appeal, which challenges this\r\n    conclusion, therefore constitutes a disguised and impermissible attempt to\r\n    argue that the acquittals were unreasonable.\n\n[21]\n\nIn support of this argument, the respondent submits that the second\r\n    category of cases identified in\nR. v.\n\nJ.M.H.\n, set out above\r\n    and relied on by the Crown to ground its appeal, does not licence the Crown to\r\n    appeal from an acquittal based on an argument that the trial judgeÂ’s ultimate\r\n    conclusion was wrong.Â  To conclude otherwise, the respondent says, would run\r\n    afoul of the principles articulated in\nR. v. Biniaris\n, 2000 SCC 15, [2000]\r\n    1 S.C.R. 381, the presumption of innocence and the CrownÂ’s burden of proof in a\r\n    criminal case. Where, as here, a factual foundation for an acquittal exists,\r\n    that acquittal is not reviewable based solely on the contention that it was\r\n    incorrect or unreasonable.\n\n[22]\n\nSecond, the respondent submits that, in any event, the trial judge did\r\n    not err. He correctly identified the relevant legal standard under s. 150.1(4)\r\n    of the\nCode\n\nand\r\n    applied it properly to the facts as found. Further, the evidence supports his conclusion\r\n    that the respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’\r\n    ages in all the circumstances.\n\nIV.Â  Â Â Â  Discussion\n\n[23]\n\nIn my view, it is unnecessary to address the first issue raised on\r\n    appeal. Assuming, without deciding, that the Crown has raised a question of law\r\n    alone, thereby entitling it to appeal from the respondentÂ’s acquittals, I conclude\r\n    that there is no basis for appellate interference with the trial judgeÂ’s holding\r\n    that the evidence at trial raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the\r\n    respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. I say\r\n    this for the following reasons.\n\n(1)\n\nThe Trial Judge Properly Identified the Legal Principles Governing the\r\n    Mistake of Age Defence\n\n[24]\n\nFirst, I see no error in the trial judgeÂ’s articulation of the legal principles\r\n    governing the mistake of age defence under s. 150.1(4) of the\nCode\n.\n\n[25]\n\nThe Crown concedes that, generally, the trial judge correctly identified\r\n    the legal test for the s. 150.1(4) defence and the applicable legal principles\r\n    underlying the provision. Nevertheless, the Crown points to the following\r\n    passage from the trial judgeÂ’s reasons, at para. 44, to argue that he erred in\r\n    his approach to the defence:\n\nIn essence,\nI am required to consider whether\nindividually or as part of a global assessment of the indicia [of the\r\n    complainantsÂ’ ages], and while importing the accusedÂ’s subjective belief,\na\r\n    reasonable person would believe that the person was less than 16 years of age,\r\n    without further inquiry\n. If that determination cannot be made on an\r\n    objective basis, the question becomes what further steps a reasonable person\r\n    would have had to take in the circumstances. [Emphasis added.]\n\n[26]\n\nBased on this passage, the Crown contends in its factum that, in\r\n    assessing what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to\r\n    ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages and whether the indicia of age in this case\r\n    were sufficient on their own to obviate any need for further inquiry, the trial\r\n    judge Â“may have been looking for evidence which would suggest that the [c]omplainants\r\n    were under 16, rather than indicia that strongly [support] an inference that\r\n    the [c]omplainants were 16 years or moreÂ”. This allegedly Â“less than stringentÂ”\r\n    approach, the Crown argues, indicates that the trial judge erred: i) by failing\r\n    to apply a purposive approach to the question whether further inquiry was\r\n    required concerning the complainantsÂ’ ages; and ii) by failing to properly\r\n    assess whether the indicia that the complainants were 16 years or older were\r\n    truly compelling.\n\n[27]\n\nI disagree. Read as a whole, the trial judgeÂ’s reasons reveal that he\r\n    appreciated the legal standard established by s. 150.1(4) and that the indicia\r\n    of age said to relieve against the need for further inquiry must be both\r\n    compelling in all the circumstances and directed at whether the complainants\r\n    were more than 16 years of age. I see nothing in his reasons to suggest that\r\n    the trial judge ignored or misconstrued these requirements in his assessment of\r\n    the evidence.\n\n[28]\n\nIn his reasons, the trial judge described the pertinent issues at trial\r\n    as Â“whether the accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the\r\n    complainantsÂ” and whether he could avail himself of the mistake of age defence\r\n    provided under s. 150.1(4) of the\nCode\n: paras. 2 and 23. Later in his\r\n    reasons, at para. 56, the trial judge provided this description of the s.\r\n    150.1(4) mistake of age defence:\n\nThe\nCode\ndemands that those who engage in sexual\r\n    activity with young persons will make reasonable efforts to ascertain the age\r\n    of prospective partners. Section 150.1(4) of the\nCriminal Code\nlimits\r\n    the application of the defence of honest but mistaken belief to cases in which\r\n    the accused has taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the\r\n    complainant. This section places an evidential but not persuasive burden on the\r\n    accused. It requires only that there be evidence, which, if true, would result\r\n    in an acquittal.\nThe evidence need only raise a reasonable doubt, but must\r\n    be directed to Â“allÂ” the reasonable steps that should have been taken. The\r\n    jurisprudence provides that the requirement set out in s. 150.1(4) is an\r\n    earnest inquiry or some other compelling factor which negates the need for an\r\n    inquiry. Whether an accused took all reasonable steps is fact-specific and\r\n    depends on the circumstances\n. [Emphasis added.]\n\n[29]\n\nThese comments confirm that the trial judge appreciated the legal test\r\n    under s. 150.1(4) and the established principles for the application of the\r\n    mistake of age defence.\n\n[30]\n\nThe impugned passage from the reasons relied on by the Crown consists of\r\n    one sentence amidst 16 pages (and 71 paragraphs) of reasons. It precedes the\r\n    trial judgeÂ’s correct enunciation at para. 56 of his reasons, quoted above, of\r\n    the nature and requirements of s. 150.1(4). Notably, at para. 56, the trial\r\n    judge expressly indicated that the inquiry required under s. 150.1(4) is Â“an\r\n    earnest inquiry or some other compelling factor which negates the need for an\r\n    inquiryÂ” and that the question whether the Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” standard has\r\n    been met is Â“fact-specific and depends on the circumstancesÂ”.\n\n[31]\n\nMoreover, the trial judge also explicitly recognized, at para. 63, that:\nÂ“\n[t]here must be some compelling\r\n    factor that obviates the need for an enquiry by the accusedÂ” and Â“\nthe\r\n    accusedÂ’s subjective belief [as to the complainantÂ’s age] is relevant but not\r\n    determinative of this question.Â”\n\n[32]\n\nElsewhere in his reasons, at para. 36, the trial judge observed:\n\nIn\n[\nOsborne\n]\n, the court held that s. 150.1(4)\r\n    imposed Â“more than a casual requirementÂ”. The court also noted that the word\r\n    Â“allÂ” in respect of referencing Â“reasonable stepsÂ” is important. While it is\r\n    only necessary for the accused to create a reasonable doubt, the evidence which\r\n    he uses to establish such doubt must be directed to the word [Â“allÂ”] as much as\r\n    to any other part of the subsection.\n\n[33]\n\nFinally, throughout his reasons, the trial judge focused on whether the\r\n    complainants had portrayed themselves as Â“older than 16Â”. He examined the whole\r\n    of the evidence bearing on this issue and, as I will detail later in these\r\n    reasons, made explicit findings regarding the complainantsÂ’ age-related\r\n    appearance, statements, behaviour and conduct. These included the following\r\n    findings, at para. 60:\n\nIt is important to note that\nboth\n[\ncomplainants\n]\nmade unsolicited comments\nin the vehicle and at the\r\n    residence\nin tandem with their purposeful portrayal of themselves as\n[\nwomen\n]\nwho were older than 16\n, interspersed with sexually explicit comments\r\n    admittedly to entice the accused in their collective attempt to have Â“funÂ”.\r\n    [Emphasis added.]\n\n[34]\n\nThe trial judgeÂ’s reasons must be read as a whole, rather than in a piece-meal\r\n    fashion.Â  In my opinion, viewed in their entirety, they belie the CrownÂ’s\r\n    contention that the trial judge erred in his approach to the s. 150.1(4)\r\n    defence or that he failed to apply the requisite degree of scrutiny to the\r\n    indicia of the complainantsÂ’ ages relied on by the respondent.\n\n[35]\n\nAccordingly, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in the manner\r\n    urged by the Crown. I would reject this ground of appeal.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Trial Judge Properly Applied the Section 150.1(4) Standard\n\n[36]\n\nWhere a mistake of age defence is raised under s. 150.1(4), the accused\r\n    must point to some evidence that he or she honestly believed the complainant\r\n    was 16 years or more and that he or she took all reasonable steps to ascertain\r\n    the complainantÂ’s age. If the accused meets this evidentiary burden, the Crown\r\n    is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not have\r\n    the requisite belief or that he or she failed to take all reasonable steps to\r\n    ascertain the complainantÂ’s age:\nR. v. L.T.P.\n(1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d)\r\n    42 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 16-19;\nR. v. Osborne\n(1992), 102 Nfld. &amp;\r\n    P.E.I.R. 194 (Nfld. C.A.), at paras. 47-49 and 61.\n\n[37]\n\nIn this case, it appears that there was no dispute at trial that the\r\n    respondent subjectively believed that the complainants were over 16 years of\r\n    age. The contentious issue was whether he took all reasonable steps to\r\n    ascertain their true ages.\n\n[38]\n\nThe trial judge concluded that the evidence at trial raised a reasonable\r\n    doubt on this core issue and that the Crown failed to meet its burden to prove\r\n    that the respondent did not take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to\r\n    ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. The Crown attacks these conclusions on the\r\n    basis that the indicia of age relied on by the respondent, and accepted by the\r\n    trial judge, were inconclusive and uncompelling. The Crown argues that the factual\r\n    circumstances of this case are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to\r\n    whether the respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’\r\n    ages, as required by s. 150.1(4), and that a reasonable person in the\r\n    respondentÂ’s circumstances would have made further inquiries.\n\n[39]\n\nAgain, I disagree.Â  In my opinion, it was open to the trial judge on the\r\n    record before him to conclude that a reasonable person in the respondentÂ’s\r\n    circumstances would not have made any positive inquiries to ascertain the\r\n    complainantsÂ’ ages, based on the compelling indicia of age present in this case.\n\n[40]\n\nSection 150.1(4) mandates an inquiry akin to a due diligence inquiry.\r\n    The analysis involves comparing the steps, if any, taken by an accused to\r\n    determine the complainantÂ’s age with the steps that a reasonable person would\r\n    have taken in those circumstances:\nR. v. Saliba\n, 2013 ONCA 661, 304\r\n    C.C.C. (3d) 133, at para.\n28;\nR. v. Dragos\n, 2012 ONCA\r\n    538, 111 O.R. (3d) 481, at paras.\n29-33.\n\n[41]\n\nIn\nR. v. L.T.P.\n, the British Columbia Court of Appeal\r\n    considered those steps that might be reasonable for an accused to take in order\r\n    to ascertain a complainantÂ’s age. The court stated, at para. 20:\n\nIn considering whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable\r\n    doubt that the accused has not taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the\r\n    complainantÂ’s age, the Court must ask what steps would have been reasonable for\r\n    the accused to take in the circumstances.\nAs suggested in R. v. Hayes,\r\n    supra, sometimes a visual observation alone may suffice.Â  Whether further steps\r\n    would be reasonable would depend upon the apparent indicia of the complainantÂ’s\r\n    age, and the accusedÂ’s knowledge of same, including: the accusedÂ’s knowledge of\r\n    the complainantÂ’s physical appearance and behaviour; the ages and appearance of\r\n    others in whose company the complainant is found; the activities engaged in\r\n    either by the complainant individually, or as part of a group; and the times,\r\n    places, and other circumstances in which the complainant and her conduct are\r\n    observed by the accused\n.\n\nEvidence as to the accusedÂ’s\r\n    subjective state of mind is relevant but not conclusive because, as pointed out\r\n    in\nR. v. Hayes\nat p. 11, Â“[a]n accused may believe that he or she has\r\n    taken all reasonable steps only to find that the trial judge or jury may find\r\n    differentlyÂ”. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n[42]\n\nThis court has also addressed the issue of what constitutes Â“all\r\n    reasonable stepsÂ” for the purpose of s. 150.1(4). In\nR. v. Duran\n, 2013\r\n    ONCA 343, 306 O.A.C. 301, at para. 54, Laskin J.A. endorsed the above-quoted\r\n    comments in\nR. v. L.T.P.\nHe also noted, at para. 52, that Â“[t]here is\r\n    no automatic checklist of considerations applicable to every caseÂ”, that what\r\n    constitutes Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” depends on the context and the\r\n    circumstances, and that, Â“in some cases, an accusedÂ’s visual observation of the\r\n    complainant may be enough to constitute reasonable steps.Â”\n\n[43]\n\nIn\nDuran\n, the court was concerned with the adequacy of the\r\n    trial judgeÂ’s jury instructions on what was required to make out the statutory defence\r\n    under s.Â 150.1(4). In that context, Laskin J.A. stated, at para. 53:\n\nIn this case, the trial judge should have instructed the jury\r\n    to determine whether what the appellant knew and observed about the complainant\r\n    were all the steps a reasonable person needed to take or whether a reasonable\r\n    person ought to have made further inquiries. In making that determination,\nthe\r\n    jury should have been told to take account of the following considerations and\r\n    the evidence on them: the accusedÂ’s observation of the complainant; the\r\n    complainantÂ’s appearance and behaviour; the information the complainant told the\r\n    appellant about herself, including any information about her age; and the age\r\n    differential between the appellant and the complainant\n. [Emphasis added.]\n\n[44]\n\nThese instructions, Laskin J.A. emphasized, would focus the juryÂ’s\r\n    deliberations Â“on the question whether the steps the [accused] had already\r\n    taken Â– what he had observed and what he knew Â– were sufficient without further\r\n    inquiryÂ”: at para. 55.\n\n[45]\n\nIn this case, the trial judge expressly considered what the respondent\r\n    had observed and what he knew about the complainants on the night in question. In\r\n    accordance with this courtÂ’s directions in\nDuran\n, he reviewed the\r\n    evidence of the respondentÂ’s observations of the complainants, the\r\n    complainantsÂ’ appearance and behaviour and the information the complainants\r\n    provided to the respondent about themselves and their ages. In so doing, he made\r\n    the following pertinent findings of fact:\n\n(1)\n\nboth\r\n    complainants made unsolicited, sexually-explicit comments in the respondentÂ’s\r\n    vehicle and at his parentsÂ’ home, in tandem with their purposeful portrayal of\r\n    themselves as women who were older than 16 (at para. 60);\n\n(2)\n\nby\r\n    the complainantsÂ’ own admissions, their sexually explicit comments were made to\r\n    entice the respondent, in the complainantsÂ’ self-described attempt to have\r\n    Â“funÂ” (at para. 60);\n\n(3)\n\nV.T.\r\n    admitted that she had no difficulty acting older than her true age, based on\r\n    her routine, unchallenged purchase of cigarettes and liquor, her size and her\r\n    appearance (at para. 47);\n\n(4)\n\nV.T.\r\n    acknowledged that, on the night in question, she had actively portrayed herself\r\n    as older by her physical appearance and demeanour, and by dressing and using\r\n    makeup to achieve this purpose (at paras. 47 and 49);\n\n(5)\n\nV.T.\r\n    admitted that, while in the respondentÂ’s car, the complainants told him they had\r\n    just been at a college party and missed their ride. She also confirmed that\r\n    both she and A.S. had made sexually suggestive comments to the respondent,\r\n    while travelling in his vehicle (at para. 47);\n\n(6)\n\nV.T.\r\n    admitted on cross-examination that she had never informed the respondent about\r\n    her age, despite her earlier assertion, during her examination-in-chief, that\r\n    she had done so. This non-disclosure was Â“consistent with her stated demeanourÂ”\r\n    on the night in question (at paras. 46 and 61);\n\n(7)\n\nsimilarly,\r\n    A.S. Â“purposefullyÂ” never provided her age to the respondent. Further, she\r\n    Â“acted in a similar mannerÂ” to that of V.T. (at para. 61);\n\n(8)\n\nboth\r\n    complainants admitted that they looked and acted older than their actual ages\r\n    and left the impression that they were older than they in fact were. According\r\n    to A.S., they were able to do so Â“without any effortÂ” (at paras. 64 and 65);\n\n(9)\n\nfor\r\n    both girls, it was Â“some badge of honourÂ” to be portrayed as so mature (at\r\n    para. 64); and\n\n(10)\n\nV.T.Â’s Â“self-admittedÂ”\r\n    and A.S.Â’s Â“tacit presentation and demeanourÂ” of Â“wanting to and acting much\r\n    older than their true ages Â… was consistent with the [respondentÂ’s] passive\r\n    observationsÂ” of the complainants (at para. 65).\n\n[46]\n\nThe trial judge was also mindful of the significance of the age difference\r\n    between the respondent (40 years old) and the complainants (14 and one-half\r\n    years old (V.T.) and 15 and one-half years old (A.S.)). Citing\nR. v. R.A.K.\n(1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 93 (N.B.C.A.), he stated, at para. 37 of his reasons:\n\nThe facts in each situation dictate as to what constitutes\r\n    reasonable steps in the circumstances. The court [in\nR. v. R.A.K.\n] also\r\n    opined at page 96 that the age differential between the accused and the\r\n    complainant would be relevant in determining whether the steps taken are\r\n    reasonable as: Â“almost without exception, the greater the disparity in ages,\r\n    the more inquiry will be required.Â” Indeed, in this case there is a significant\r\n    disparity in the ages of the participants.\n\n[47]\n\nThe trial judge returned to this factor later in his reasons. He noted\r\n    the respondentÂ’s admission that he had not expressly asked the complainants\r\n    about their respective ages and said, at para. 55:\n\nThe accused testified that he was married at the time with\r\n    young children. I am not here to judge his morality.\nHowever, the\r\n    accusedÂ’s age and the discrepancy here is not lost on me\n. [Emphasis\r\n    added.]\n\n[48]\n\nHowever, given his factual findings about the respondentÂ’s observations\r\n    and the information available to him, the trial judge held that no further inquiries\r\n    were required to satisfy the Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” standard.Â  He stated with\r\n    reference to the complainantsÂ’ evidence, at para. 59:\n\nThe evidence that I accept from the complainants on the issue\r\n    of all reasonable steps to ascertain their age is that, in the later evening\r\n    hours, they were boldly hitchhiking, subsequently they requested and were in\r\n    fact, dropped off close to midnight in another part of the City, they claimed\r\n    they had just come from a college party and had missed their ride; they openly\r\n    discussed explicit sexual behaviour with the other sex and with their own\r\n    gender in the accusedÂ’s vehicle and without any prompting from him; they\r\n    discussed having just finished high school and were desirous of consuming\r\n    alcohol and smoking cigarettes.\n\n[49]\n\nThe trial judge set out his ultimate conclusion, at para. 66 of his\r\n    reasons, in these terms:\n\nIt is the second branch of\nR. v. W.(D.)\nthat is at\r\n    play here. I find that the accusedÂ’s evidence raises a reasonable doubt. In my\r\n    opinion, the complainantsÂ’ demonstrated actions, demeanour and self-professed\r\n    stated objectives and portraying themselves older than their true ages, along\r\n    with the constellation of factors did not require further enquiries from the\r\n    accused.\n\n[50]\n\nOn the evidentiary record in this case, I see no reversible error in this\r\n    conclusion. Section 150.1(4) of the\nCode\ndoes not require that an\r\n    accused make every possible inquiry to ascertain a complainantÂ’s age in order\r\n    to successfully mount a mistake of age defence. Nor do the established\r\n    authorities suggest that an accused must always expressly question a complainant\r\n    about his or her age, or otherwise seek and obtain conclusive proof of age, in\r\n    order to avail himself or herself of the s. 150.1(4) defence. Rather, the\r\n    section requires that\nall\n\nreasonable\nsteps be taken to\r\n    ascertain a complainantÂ’s age. As the trial judge recognized, what is\r\n    Â“reasonableÂ” will vary, depending on the context and all the circumstances.\n\n[51]\n\nIn this case, based on the facts as he found them and for cogent reasons\r\n    that he explained, the trial judge concluded that the evidence at trial raised a\r\n    reasonable doubt on the central issue whether the respondent took all\r\n    reasonable steps to ascertain the complainants' ages. In reaching this\r\n    conclusion, the trial judge recognized that the respondentÂ’s and the\r\n    complainantsÂ’ credibility and the question whether the complainants had\r\n    represented themselves to the respondent as over 16 years of age were critical issues.\r\n    In evaluating these issues, he took express account of the governing principles\r\n    regarding the mistake of age defence under s. 150.1(4) of the\nCode\n,\r\n    including those set out in\nR. v. L.T.P.\n\n\n[52]\n\nThe trial judge also fully canvassed the available indicia of the\r\n    complainantsÂ’ ages, as established in the evidence. On his findings, the complainants\r\n    essentially admitted at trial that they had engaged in a deliberate, premeditated,\r\n    and successful attempt to present themselves as older than 16. Further, their appearance,\r\n    actions and words, and the information they conveyed to the respondent about\r\n    themselves and their ages were specifically designed to achieve this end. The\r\n    respondentÂ’s counsel put it succinctly in their factum:\n\nThe information which was provided to the respondent included\r\n    that the complainants had finished high school, that they had just left a\r\n    college party, that they enjoyed smoking, drinking, and partying, that they\r\n    were sexually open and experienced, and that they intended to have a sexual\r\n    encounter that night. Their appearance, including their make-up, dress and\r\n    comportment, was consistent with the information provided. When they returned to\r\n    the respondentÂ’s parentÂ’s home, the complainants were sexually forward and\r\n    acted in a way that was consistent with the age[s] they portrayed.\n\n[53]\n\nOf course, this does not mean that a complainantÂ’s conduct and\r\n    appearance will always obviate the need for further inquiry about the\r\n    complainantÂ’s age.Â  A reasonable person would appreciate that underage children\r\n    may apply make-up and dress and act so as to appear older.Â  However, in this\r\n    case, it is my view that the combined effect of the evidence of the information\r\n    provided to the respondent and the observations made by him justified the trial\r\n    judgeÂ’s conclusion that the need to inquire further about the complainantsÂ’\r\n    ages was obviated.\n\n[54]\n\nAccordingly, in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, it was\r\n    open to the trial judge to conclude, on the compelling factors that he\r\n    identified, that a reasonable person would have been satisfied that the complainants\r\n    were over the age of 16, just as the complainants intended, without the need\r\n    for further inquiry.\n\nV.Â  Â Â Â Â  Disposition\n\n[55]\n\nFor the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\nReleased:\n\nÂ“MTÂ”Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â“E.A.\r\n    Cronk J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“APR 28 2016Â”Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â“I agree\r\n    M.

Coderre, 2016 ONCA 276\n\nDATE: 20160419\n\nDOCKET: C55920\n\nMacPherson, MacFarland and LaForme JJ.A.\n\nBETWEEN\n\nHer Majesty the Queen\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nTerrance Coderre\n\nAppellant\n\nEva Tache-Green, for the appellant\n\nMichael Fawcett, for the respondent\n\nHeard: April 7, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the convictions entered on January 26,\r\n    2012 by Justice Robert B. Reid of the Superior Court, sitting without a jury.\n\nH.S. LaForme J.A.:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1]\n\nThe appellant appeals from convictions related to the unlawful\r\n    cultivation of marijuana and the possession of firearms. He argues that the\r\n    evidence seized by the police while executing a search warrant at his home should\r\n    have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\n. For the reasons that\r\n    follow, I disagree and would dismiss the appeal.\n\n(1)\n\nThe first search\n\n[2]\n\nThe police started an investigation into the appellantÂ’s suspected drug\r\n    dealing activities after receiving inculpatory information from reliable\r\n    informants and anonymous tipsters. On March 2, 2009, they obtained a general\r\n    search warrant pursuant to s. 487.01 of the\nCriminal Code\n, R.S.C.\r\n    1985, c. C-46.\n\nThe warrant included a statutorily-mandated requirement\r\n    to inform the appellant of the existence and execution of the warrant within\r\n    180 days after the warrantÂ’s execution.\n\n[3]\n\nThe warrant was executed on March 18, 2009. The police did not find any\r\n    drugs but they did find evidence consistent with a drug operation. The notice\r\n    period expired on September 14, 2009. The police did not provide the required\r\n    notice before the expiry of the notice period. They did not apply to extend the\r\n    notice period either.\n\n(2)\n\nThe second search\n\n[4]\n\nThe investigation was put on pause after the first search, but resumed\r\n    on October 1, 2009. The police applied for a second warrant under the\nControlled\r\n    Drugs and Substances Act,\nS.C. 1996, c. 19 (Â“\nCDSA\nÂ”). The\nCDSA\nwarrant was obtained using an Information to Obtain (Â“ITOÂ”) which included\r\n    information obtained during the first search. The second warrant was executed\r\n    on October 8, 2009. The appellant was informed of the first warrant and search\r\n    at this time. During the second search, the police seized drugs and weapons.\n\nTHE\n\nCHARTER\nAPPLICATION\n\n[5]\n\nThe appellant brought an application to exclude all of the evidence\r\n    seized by the police during the second search. The application was dismissed\r\n    and, as a result, the appellant did not contest a finding of guilt.\n\n[6]\n\nThe trial judge correctly recognized that\r\n    he needed to address two separate issues: first, whether the evidence at issue\r\n    was acquired Â“in a manner that infringedÂ” a\nCharter\n-protected right; and, second, whether the admission\r\n    of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\n\n[7]\n\nThe appellant conceded that the first\r\n    search warrant was properly obtained and properly executed. Thus, the trial\r\n    judge focused on whether the failure to provide notice within the mandated\r\n    notice period engaged the appellantÂ’s\nCharter\nrights. He concluded that:\n\nfailing to give notice does not engage a\nCharter\nright, coming as it does after the valid issuing and proper execution of the\r\n    warrant. This is especially so when no evidence to be used against the\r\n    applicant was located in the search.\n\n[8]\n\nThe trial judge also noted that the only\r\n    evidence obtained during the first search used in the ITO was corroboration\r\n    about the location of security cameras. That information, he said, was not\r\n    necessary to obtain the second warrant and could easily be excised.\n\n[9]\n\nThe evidence seized during the second search, the trial judge concluded,\r\n    was not obtained in a manner that engaged s. 24(2). The trial judgeÂ’s\r\n    conclusion rested on the fact that there was no temporal nexus between that\r\n    failure to provide notice and the evidence obtained from the second search.\r\n    That is the second search was Â“too remote from the alleged breachÂ”. Accordingly,\r\n    he held that the evidence seized by the police was not obtained in a manner\r\n    that violated the\nCharter\n.\n\n[10]\n\nThe\r\n    trial judge went on to consider the evaluative component of the s. 24(2)\r\n    analysis. He concluded that even if the evidence was obtained in a manner that\r\n    infringed the\nCharter\n, he would not exclude it under s. 24(2). The\r\n    trial judge laid out and then considered the three factors from\nR. v. Grant\n, 2009 SCC 32,Â  [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, as follows\n:\n\n(i)\nSeriousness\r\n    of the Charter-infringing conduct:\nThere was no bad faith on the part\r\n    of the police officers and they fully disclosed the failure to provide notice\r\n    when obtaining the second warrant.\n\n(ii)\nThe\r\n    impact of the breach on the accused:\nThe impact on the appellantÂ’s\nCharter\n-protected\r\n    right was minimal because if the police had requested an extension they would\r\n    have obtained it and they ended up telling the appellant about the search 23\r\n    days after the notice period expired.\n\n(iii)\nSocietyÂ’s\r\n    interest in adjudication on the merits:\nGiven the importance of the\r\n    evidence seized to the CrownÂ’s case, societyÂ’s interest in adjudicating the\r\n    charges on their merits favoured inclusion.\n\nISSUES\n\n[11]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in three ways: (i) in failing to\r\n    find that non-compliance with the notice requirement infringed s. 8; (ii) by\r\n    concluding that the connection between breach of the notice requirement and\r\n    obtaining the evidence at issue was too remote; and (iii) in concluding that\r\n    the conduct of the police did not amount to bad faith.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n(1)\n\nDid the trial judge err in concluding that the failure to provide notice\r\n    did not infringe the appellantÂ’s s.8 rights?\n\n[12]\n\nThe\r\n    Crown concedes that the failure to provide notice infringed s. 8 of the\nCharter\n.\r\n    I agree.\n\n[13]\n\nIn\nR. v. Tse\n, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R.\r\n    531, the court held that Â“\n[a] requirement of after-the-fact notice casts\r\n    a constitutionally important light back on the statutorily authorised\r\n    intrusionÂ” and that s. 8 protects an Â“ability to identify and challenge such\r\n    invasions, and to seek a meaningful remedy.Â” The failure to abide by a\r\n    statutorily-mandated requirement to provide notice fails to give effect to\r\n    those protections and, therefore, infringes the\nCharter\n.\n\n(2)\n\nDid the trial judge err in concluding that the evidence was not obtained\r\n    in a manner that infringed the\nCharter\n?\n\n[14]\n\nIn order to engage s. 24(2), a defendant needs to show\r\n    that the impugned evidence was obtained Â“in a manner that infringedÂ” a\nCharter\n-protected right.\nThat requirement will be\r\n    satisfied where, on a review of the entire course of events, a court is\r\n    satisfied that the breach and the obtaining of the evidence was part of the\r\n    same transaction or course of conduct. Courts will take a generous approach\r\n    when evaluating this threshold issue. The connection between the breach and the\r\n    obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination\r\n    of the three.Â The connection must be more than tenuous:\nR. v.\n\nPlaha\n(2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 45.\n\n[15]\n\nWith respect, the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence\r\n    seized during the second search was not obtained in a manner that infringed s.\r\n    8. In his analysis, the trial judge focused primarily on the temporal\r\n    connection between the breach and the seizing of the evidence. On that basis,\r\n    he concluded that the connection was too remote.\n\n[16]\n\nWhile\nthe connection between the failure to provide notice\r\n    and the seizure of the evidence at issue is arguably weak, it is not tenuous.\r\n    In my view, the two\nclearly\noccurred as a\r\n    part of the same police investigation.\nIn his reasons the trial judge\r\n    notes that, after the first search, the police paused their investigation and\r\n    that Â“[on] October 1, 2009, the\ninvestigation was\r\n    continued\nunder the direction of a different police officerÂ” (emphasis\r\n    added). And he further noted that:\n\nBased on the evidence, it is reasonable to assume that since\nthe investigation had not been concluded, but rather\r\n    temporarily deferred\n, there was no desire on the part of the police to\r\n    give notice to the police within the 180 day time frame,\nsince\r\n    to do so would jeopardize the ongoing investigation\n. [Emphasis added.]\n\n[17]\n\nIt\r\n    was obvious to the trial judge that, although different police officers picked\r\n    up the investigation later on, this was one continuous investigation and not\r\n    two separate ones. This certainly suggests that what occurred in this case was\r\n    part of the same transaction or course of conduct.\n\n[18]\n\nMoreover, I would highlight the fact that the police\r\n    chose not to inform the appellant of the\nf\nirst\ns\nearch because they concluded that doing\r\n    so would undermine their investigation\n. That deliberate choice, in my\r\n    opinion, connects the breach at issue to the second search warrant and the evidence\r\n    obtained through its execution. Therefore, the evidence at issue was obtained\r\n    in a manner that infringed a\nCharter\n-protected right.\n\n(3)\n\nDid the trial judge err in not excluding the evidence under s. 24(2) of\r\n    the\nCharter\n?\n\n[19]\n\nIn my view, in spite of the errors noted, the trial\r\n    judgeÂ’s decision to not exclude the evidence should be upheld. I reach this\r\n    conclusion for several reasons\n.\n\n[20]\n\nFirst,\r\n    the trial judgeÂ’s conclusion that the police did not engage in bad faith is\r\n    reasonable and supported by the evidence. Here, at the first stage of the\nGrant\nanalysis, the court Â“must consider the seriousness of the violation,\r\n    viewed in terms of the gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities\r\n    whom the rule of law requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the\nCharter\nÂ”:\nR. v. Dhillon\n, 2010 ONCA 582, 260 C.C.C. (3d) 53, at para. 46.\n\n[21]\n\nContrary to the appellantÂ’s assertions, the police\r\n    negligence in this case is not the kind of systemic negligence or failure\r\n    described in\nGrant\nat paras. 73-74\n. The appellantÂ’s arguments suggesting that the police officer asking for\r\n    the second warrant misled the issuing justice are not convincing. In fact, as\r\n    noted by the trial judge, the police disclosed their failure to provide notice\r\n    in the ITO for the second warrant. I agree with the trial judgeÂ’s conclusion\r\n    that the policeÂ’s conduct was at worst negligent and did not demonstrate a\r\n    deliberate disregard for the appellantÂ’s rights.\n\n[22]\n\nSecond,\r\n    the appellant has not seriously attacked the trial judgeÂ’s findings on the\r\n    other two\nGrant\nfactors. While the second search targeted the\r\n    appellantÂ’s home, which attracts significant\nCharter\nprotection, it\r\n    seems clear that the police would have obtained an extension of the notice\r\n    period if they had applied for it. In that case, the police would have complied\r\n    with the\nCharter\nand the appellant would still have been subject to\r\n    the second search. And, at the end of the day, the police did inform the\r\n    appellant of the first search and he had an opportunity to challenge its\r\n    legality. Therefore, the impact on the appellantÂ’s\nCharter\n-protected\r\n    interest was attenuated.\n\n[23]\n\nFinally, there is no reason to question the trial\r\n    judgeÂ’s conclusion that societyÂ’s interest in adjudicating the case on its\r\n    merits favours including the evidence. As such, all three\nGrant\nfactors favour including the evidence.\n\nDISPOSITION\n\n[24]\n\nFor\r\n    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\nReleased:\n\nÂ“JCMÂ”Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â“H.S.\r\n    LaForme J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“APR 19 2016Â”Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â“I agree J.C.\r\n    MacPherson J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“I\r\n    agree J.

Edwin Boeve, for the appellant\n\nSarah Shaikh, for the respondent\n\nHeard:Â  April 7, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the conviction entered on September 10,\r\n    2013 by Justice M. Block of the Ontario Court of Justice.\n\nENDORSEMENT\n\n[1]\n\nThe only issue facing the trial judge was whether there was any Â“air of\r\n    realityÂ” to the appellantÂ’s assertion of the defence of duress to the charge of\r\n    possession of about 7 lbs of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.\n\n[2]\n\nThe evidence disclosed that the appellant was indebted to a Â“Mr. XÂ” for\r\n    about $40,000 that he had borrowed from\n\nMr. X.\n\n[3]\n\nThrough a series of unfortunate circumstances, including the loss of his\r\n    job, the appellant was unable to pay the debt. Mr. X as it turned out, was an\r\n    unsavoury character who threatened the appellant and his family when the appellant\r\n    was unable to pay.\n\n[4]\n\nMr. X proposed that the appellant could Â“work offÂ” the debt by making\r\n    deliveries and pick-ups of drugs. The appellant, whose credit was Â“maxed outÂ”\r\n    and had no other source of ready income, agreed to the proposal. He was caught\r\n    on his 9th or 10th pick-up/delivery with seven lbs of marijuana in his vehicle.\n\n[5]\n\nThe trial judge reviewed the law of duress as it had been recently\r\n    stated by the Supreme Court in\nR. v. Ryan\n; he itemized the six\r\n    necessary elements for the defence to succeed. He found that the appellant was\r\n    unable to satisfy the requirement that he had no safe avenue of escape. First,\r\n    it was not clear to him on the evidence that the Â appellant lacked the\r\n    resources to pay the debt, and second, he could have gone to the police.\n\n[6]\n\nThe facts here are not unlike those in\nR. v. Keller\n, 1998 A.J.\r\n    No 1257, a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal. Mr. Keller was arrested at\r\n    the Calgary Airport where heÂ’d picked up a package containing 240 hits of LSD.\r\n    He was searched and 50 additional hits were found in his wallet. He admitted to\r\n    picking up at least 10 similar packages in the four months preceding his\r\n    arrest. He said he was compelled to do so under a threat of death or serious\r\n    bodily harm made by a man he knew as Â“ShawnÂ”, a known drug dealer. Keller was\r\n    indebted to Shawn as the result of inadvertently destroying a quantity of\r\n    ShawnÂ’s drugs. Sometime later, Shawn appeared and demanded either payment or\r\n    that Keller work off the debt. Keller couldnÂ’t pay. He said he did not go to\r\n    the police because he was afraid of Shawn and didnÂ’t think the police could\r\n    protect him. He felt he would be unsafe moving to B.C. where his mother, with\r\n    whom he enjoyed a good relationship, lived; he told no one about the threats or\r\n    his activities because he was embarrassed. He claimed his involvement was\r\n    solely to pay off his debt to Shawn. Keller, like the appellant here, said he\r\n    felt he had no choice but to comply with ShawnÂ’s demands. As the court noted:\n\n... while the common law defence of duress was potentially\r\n    available to Keller it was, like any other defence, not actually available\r\n    unless it had Â‘an air ofÂ Â Â Â  realityÂ’.\n\n[7]\n\nAnd at para 24:\n\n... the existence of a safe avenue of escape is to be\r\n    determined on an objective standard and is adjusted for subjective\r\n    circumstances. The belief of the accused that he had no reasonable alternative\r\n    is not sufficient to give an air of reality to the defence simply because the\r\n    belief is asserted. The question is whether a reasonable person, with similar\r\n    history, personal circumstances, Â Â Â Â abilities, capacities and human frailties\r\n    as the accused, would, in the particular circumstances, reasonably believe\r\n    there was no safe avenue of escape and that he had no choice but to yield to\r\n    coercion.\n\n[8]\n\nContrary to the appellantÂ’s assertion, the trial judge here did not\r\n    reverse the onus of proof. There was an evidentiary burden on the appellant to\r\n    lead sufficient evidence to establish an air of reality to the defence of\r\n    duress Â– once satisfied, it remained for the Crown to establish guilt beyond a\r\n    reasonable doubt.\n\n[9]\n\nWhether there was a safe avenue of escape is a question of fact. Here\r\n    the trial judge concluded on the evidence before him that he was not satisfied\r\n    that the appellant had no safe avenue of escape, he could have gone to the\r\n    police or paid off the debt by liquidating his RRSPs as he eventually did after\r\n    he was charged with this offence. In other words, there was no air of reality\r\n    to his claim of duress.\n\n[10]\n\nWe\r\n    see no error in the trial judgeÂ’s findings.Â  The appeal is dismissed.\n\nÂ“J.\r\n    C.

Harflett, 2016 ONCA 248\n\nDATE: 20160406\n\nDOCKET: C59518\n\nWatt, Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A.\n\nBETWEEN\n\nHer Majesty the Queen\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nAlexander Harflett\n\nAppellant\n\nMalcolm McRae and Erec Rolfe, for the appellant\n\nRick Visca, for the respondent\n\nHeard: March 1, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the conviction entered on March 24, 2014\r\n    by Justice Catherine Kehoe of the Ontario Court of Justice.\n\nLauwers J.A.:\n\n[1]\n\nConstable Robert Sinclair was a member of\r\n    the\nEast\n\nRegion Highway Enforcement\n\nTeam,\r\n    responsible for monitoring traffic on Highway 401.\nHe was accompanied by\nTyler Brown, then an employee of the Canadian Border Services Agency. They were\r\n    parked at an On Route service centre. Constable Sinclair noticed the\r\n    appellantÂ’s car had QuÃ©bec plates, and wanted to show Mr.Â Brown how to run\r\n    a computer search on QuÃ©bec plates. He discovered that the appellantÂ’s Ontario\r\n    driverÂ’s licence was suspended for unpaid fines. The officer testifie\nd\r\n    that by the time he discovered this, the appellant was back on the highway. He\r\n    pursued the appellant and pulled him over about six kilometres down the road.\n\n[2]\n\nThe appellant produced a valid QuÃ©bec driverÂ’s licence. The officer\r\n    arrested him for driving with the licence of another jurisdiction while his\r\n    Ontario licence was suspended, and charged him under s. 36 of the\nHighway\r\n    Traffic Act\n, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8 (Â“\nHTA\nÂ”). The officer conducted\r\n    a pat-down search of the appellant, and read him his rights. He found the\r\n    appellant to be cooperative throughout.\n\n[3]\n\nThe appellant could not drive his car since his licence was suspended. The\r\n    officer called a tow truck because the car had to be removed from the highway\r\n    for safety reasons. His plan was to have the car towed to a nearby hotel, with\r\n    the appellant riding with the tow truck operator. The appellant would then be\r\n    in a position to pay the fines the next day, have his licence restored, and\r\n    continue on his way.\n\n[4]\n\nAs was his invariable practice, Constable Sinclair performed an\r\n    inventory search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle. He testified that when he opened\r\n    the trunk, he smelled the odour of raw marijuana, and discovered a large quantity\r\n    of the drug. He immediately arrested the appellant for possession of marijuana\r\n    for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2) of the\nControlled Drugs\r\n    and Substances Act\n,\nS.C.\r\n    1996, c. 19. As the officer was reading the appellant his rights a second time,\r\n    the tow truck arrived. The car was towed to the police detachment and a full\r\n    search was performed.\n\n[5]\n\nAt trial, the appellant brought a\nCharter\napplication claiming\r\n    that his s. 8\nCharter\nrights had been breached by the initial\r\n    inventory search of his vehicle before it was to be towed to a hotel, because\r\n    the officer had no authority to conduct such a search. The trial judge found\r\n    that the inventory search was reasonable and that, even if the appellantÂ’s s. 8\r\n    rights had been breached, s.Â 24(2) of the\nCharter\nfavoured the admission\r\n    of the evidence. The trial judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to\r\n    12 monthsÂ’ imprisonment, plus 12 monthsÂ’ probation.\n\n[6]\n\nThis appeal raises two issues: (i) did the trial judge err in not finding\r\n    that the inventory search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle breached his rights under\r\n    s. 8 of the\nCharter\n; and (ii) if so, did the trial judge err in\r\n    finding the evidence to be admissible under s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\n?\n\n[7]\n\nFor the reasons set out below, I would allow the appeal and exclude the\r\n    evidence under s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\n.\n\n\nIssue 1: Did the Vehicle Search Breach the AppellantÂ’s s. 8\nCharter\nRights?\n\n[8]\n\nSection 8 of the\nCharter\nprovides that Â“everyone has the right\r\n    to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.Â”\n\n[9]\n\nThe trial judge found that the initial inventory search of the vehicle\r\n    was Â“reasonableÂ”, at para. 153. The totality of her reasoning on whether the\r\n    officer breached the appellantÂ’s s. 8\nCharter\nright is found at para.\r\n    154 of her reasons:\n\nConstable Sinclair had to remove the vehicle from Highway 401,\r\n    the accused could not drive it and there was no one else to drive the vehicle.\r\n    It was therefore the responsibility of Constable Sinclair. It was reasonable to\r\n    assess any pre-existing damage to the vehicle, to verify any valuables in the\r\n    vehicle and whether there were any weapons or other dangerous items in the\r\n    vehicle. Constable Sinclair was going to release the accused and the vehicle to\r\n    a hotel and therefore, had to verify that there was nothing dangerous in the\r\n    vehicle and, prior to the tow to the hotel, the state of the vehicle and\r\n    valuables.\n\n[10]\n\nThe\r\n    trial judge accurately recorded the police officerÂ’s testimony about why he did\r\n    the inventory search.\n\nThe Governing Principles\n\n[11]\n\nAs\r\n    Binnie J. observed, roadside stops Â“sometimes develop in unpredictable waysÂ”:\nR.\r\n    v. Nolet\n, 2010 SCC 24,\n[2010] 1 S.C.R. 851\n, at\r\n    para. 4. In such situations the courtÂ’s task is to Â“proceed step-by-step\r\n    through the interactions of the police and the appellants from the initial stop\r\n    onwards to determine whether, as the situation developed, the police stayed\r\n    within their authority, having regard to the information lawfully obtained at\r\n    each stage of their inquiry.Â”\n\n[12]\n\nIn\r\n    this case, the officerÂ’s search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle was warrantless, and\r\n    was therefore presumptively unreasonable. To justify a warrantless search, the\r\n    Crown must establish, on the balance of probabilities, that (i) the search was\r\n    authorized by law; (ii) the law is reasonable; and (iii) the search was carried\r\n    out in a reasonable manner: see\nR. v. Collins\n, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at\r\n    p. 278, [1987] S.C.J. No. 15, at para. 23. The focus in this appeal is on the\r\n    first and second branches of the\nCollins\n\ntest since the\r\n    appellant concedes the third branch.\n\n[13]\n\nUnder\r\n    the first branch of the\nCollins\ntest, Â“the state authority conducting\r\n    the search must be able to point to a specific statute or common law rule that\r\n    authorizes the search. If they cannot do so, the search cannot be said to be\r\n    authorized by lawÂ”:\nR. v. Caslake\n, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 12.\n\n[14]\n\nUnder\r\n    the second branch of the\nCollins\ntest, Â“the search must be carried out\r\n    in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements the law\r\n    providesÂ”:\nCaslake\n, at para 12. The second branch is not reached\r\n    unless the first is met.\n\nThe Principles Applied\n\n[15]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant argues that the police officerÂ’s search of the appellantÂ’s car fails\r\n    the first branch of the\nCollins\n\ntest because the police officer\r\n    had neither the statutory nor the common law authority to conduct an inventory\r\n    search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle.\n\n[16]\n\nI\r\n    agree.\n\n[17]\n\nFollowing\r\n    the Supreme CourtÂ’s guidance in\nNolet\n, a\n\nstep-by-step analysis\r\n    of the roadside stop shows that the officer had no authority to conduct the\r\n    inventory search.\n\n[18]\n\nI\r\n    begin with the police officerÂ’s reasons for pulling over the appellant and\r\n    detaining him. A roadside stop of a vehicle for a provincial regulatory offence\r\n    under statutes like the\nHTA\n(e.g. speeding) is a detention: see\nR.\r\n    v. Hufsky\n, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621;\nR. v. Mellenthin\n, [1992] 3 S.C.R.\r\n    615; and\nR. v. Harrison\n, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494.\n\n[19]\n\nI\r\n    am satisfied that the appellantÂ’s initial detention was lawful. Although the\r\n    appellant argues that the police officer acted in bad faith and Â“held offÂ” at\r\n    the OnÂ Route before pulling him over on Highway 401, the trial judge\r\n    rejected this argument. For the reasons outlined below, I also reject this\r\n    argument. The officer was acting pursuant to his statutory authority under the\nHTA\n\nwhen he\n\ndetained the appellant to investigate a possible\r\n    contravention of that statute.\n\n[20]\n\nHowever,\r\n    the power to detain an individual under the\nHTA\n\ndoes not\r\n    inevitably include the power to detain or impound a vehicle, nor does it\r\n    include the power to conduct an inventory search in every situation. The\r\n    officer must be able to point to a specific duty or authority to justify his\r\n    search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle.\n\n[21]\n\nThe\r\n    inventory search cannot be justified on the basis of officer safety or any\r\n    suspicion that the appellant was involved in criminal conduct. The officer\r\n    testified that after arresting the appellant for the first time for driving\r\n    while his licence was suspended, he did not impound or seize the appellantÂ’s\r\n    car, because he\n\nwas\n\nonly\n\nconducting\r\n    a traffic\n\ninvestigation,\n\nnot\n\na\n\ncriminal\n\ninvestigation. He\nagreed\nthe\n\nappellant\n\nwas\n\npolite, cooperative\n\nand\n\nnon-confrontational\n\nthroughout.\n\nThe officer\n\ntestified\n\nthat there\n\nwas,\n\nÂ“nothing\n\nto\n\nhint\n\nof\n\ncriminality,\n\nzero.\n\nHe\n\n[the\n\nappellant]\n\nhad\n\nno\n\nprior\n\ncriminal\n\nrecord. He\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\nlisted on\n\nany\n\nof\n\nthe\n\npolice\n\nrecords\n\nas\n\nbeing\n\ninvolved\n\nin\n\nany\n\ntype\n\nof\n\ncriminal\n\nactivity, he\n\nwas\n\njust\n\nsimply\n\na\n\nsuspended\n\ndriver.Â” The officer agreed\n\nthat he had no reason to believe that\n\nthe\n\nvehicle\r\n    contained\n\nany weapons or other\n\ndangerous items.\n\n[22]\n\nThe\r\n    officer explained that he searches Â“every vehicleÂ” for which he calls a tow\r\n    truck. His view was that he was Â“totally responsibleÂ” for the car. The search\r\n    was to protect himself, the appellant, and the tow truck operator. The officer\r\n    checked first for exterior damage to the car. He explained\n\nthat in the\ninterior\nsearch he looked for\n\nweapons,\n\nother\n\ndangerous\n\nitems,\n\nand valuable\ns\n. He was concerned about\n\nweapons\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nappellant\n\nmight\n\nuse\n\nto\n\nharm\n\nthe\n\ntow\n\ntruck\n\noperator and wished to protect the operator against any allegation that\r\n    he had stolen valuable items from the car.\n\n[23]\n\nNeither\r\n    the police officer nor the trial judge was able to identify any statutory\r\n    provision that authorized police to impound the vehicle or to search the car. The\r\n    Crown indicated in oral argument that he could not identify any statutory\r\n    authority in the\nHTA\n\nthat justified either step. However, in\r\n    the absence of statutory authority, the common law can provide authority to\r\n    impound a motor vehicle:\nR. v. Waugh\n,\n\n2\n01\n0\n\nON\nC\nA\n\n10\n0, at paras. 25-26. In\nWaugh\n,\r\n    the question was whether the police had the common law power to impound an\r\n    uninsured vehicle where they suspected that the motorist would continue to\r\n    drive it. BlairÂ J.A. observed, at para. 30: Â“[t]he ability to impound the\r\n    vehicle and have it towed away, in the circumstances, is a reasonable exercise\r\n    of the police common law duty to prevent crimeÂ…, to protect the life and\r\n    property of the public, and to control traffic on the public roads.Â”\n\n[24]\n\nThe\r\n    ancillary power doctrine this court relied on in\nWaugh\n\ndoes not\r\n    apply on the facts of this appeal to authorize the inventory search because the\r\n    officer did not in fact impound the vehicle.\n\n[25]\n\nThere\r\n    was nothing in the interactions that developed between the officer and the\r\n    appellant, assessed step-by-step as required by\nNolet\n, that might have\r\n    triggered the need to do the inventory search. I note that Constable Sinclair\r\n    had no public safety concerns, since he was going to release the car to the\r\n    appellant. Â In\nWaugh\n, Blair J.A. accepted, at para. 32, that Â“courts\r\n    should be cautious in extending police power by resort to their common law\r\n    ancillary powers, particularly in circumstances where the legislature has put\r\n    in place an elaborate and comprehensive regulatory regime with carefully\r\n    balanced powers and sanctions.Â” This observation manifestly applies to this\r\n    case.\n\n[26]\n\nThe\r\n    determination of the reasonableness of the search is contextual, as\nNole\nt\nand\nMellenthin\nstate. In this instance it was quite reasonable for the\r\n    officer to look at the exterior of the car and to note any damage before asking\r\n    the tow operator to take it to the hotel. The officer had taken at least that\r\n    degree of control over the car.\n\n[27]\n\nBut\r\n    the other reasons given by the officer for the inventory search do not hold up\r\n    to scrutiny and pass constitutional muster. The owner was not going to be separated\r\n    from the car, but was to ride with the tow operator to the hotel. There was\r\n    accordingly no reason for the tow operator to access the interior of the car\r\n    and the police officer had no cause to be concerned for the operatorÂ’s safety.\n\n[28]\n\nI\r\n    reject the CrownÂ’s invitation to apply\nR. v. Nicolosi\n,\n\n[1998] O.J. No. 2554,\n40\r\n    O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.),\nat para. 36, where Doherty J.A. noted that:\n\nW\ni\nth\n\nc\nu\nst\nod\ny\n\nc\no\nm\ne\ns res\npon\nsibil\ni\nt\ny\n.\n\nO\nn\nce\n\nt\nh\ne\n\npo\nl\ni\nce\n\na\ns\ns\nu\nm\ne\n\nc\no\nn\ntrol\n\nan\nd\n\npo\nss\ne\nssi\no\nn\no\nf\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nv\neh\nic\nl\ne\n,\n\nt\nhe\ny\n\nha\nd\n\na\n\ndu\nty\n\nto\n\nt\na\nke\n\nst\ne\np\ns\n\nto\n\ns\na\nf\ne\ng\nua\nrd\n\nt\nh\ne\nv\neh\nic\nl\ne\n\nan\nd\n\nits\n\nc\non\nt\nen\nts.\n\nT\nh\nis\n\nd\nu\nty\n\nis\n\nmad\ne\n\ncle\na\nr\n\nbo\nth\n\nb\ny t\nh\ne\r\n    re\nq\nu\ni\nr\nemen\nt\r\n    [in s. 221 of the\nHTA\n] t\nh\na\nt t\nh\ne\np\no\nl\ni\nce\n\nt\na\nk\ne\n\&quot;\nc\nu\ns\nt\nod\ny\n\&quot;\n\no\nf\r\n    t\nh\ne\n\nv\neh\nic\nl\ne\na\nn\nd\n\nt\nh\ne re\nq\nu\ni\nr\nemen\nt\n\nt\nh\na\nt\n\nt\nhe\ny\n\nst\no\nre\n\nit\n\nin\n\n\&quot;\na\n\ns\nu\nit\na\nb\nle\n\np\nl\na\nc\ne\&quot;\n.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\ni\nm\np\no\nrta\nn\nt t\nha\nt\n\nt\nho\ns\ne\n\nc\nha\nr\ng\ne\nd\n\nw\nith\n\na\n\nst\na\nt\nu\nt\no\nryÂ  res\npon\nsibil\ni\nty\n\nt\na\nke re\na\ns\no\nn\nab\nle\n\ns\nt\nep\ns\n\nto\n\nf\nu\nl\nf\nil\n\nt\nh\na\nt\n\nre\ns\npon\ns\ni\nb\ni\nl\nit\ny\n.\r\n    It is\ne\nq\nua\nl\nl\ny i\nmpo\nr\nt\nan\nt\n\nt\nh\na\nt\n\nt\nh\ne\ny\n\nb\ne\n\nin\n\na\n\npo\nsition\n\nt\no\n\nd\ne\nmon\ns\ntrate\n\nt\nha\nt\n\nt\nhe\ny\nha\nv\ne\nf\nu\nl\nf\ni\nl\nled\n\nt\nha\nt\n\nres\np\non\nsibil\ni\nt\ny\n.\n\nBy\n\ndo\nc\nu\nm\nen\nti\nn\ng t\nh\ne\n\nc\non\nt\ne\nn\nts\n\no\nf\r\n    t\nh\ne\n\nv\neh\nic\nl\ne\n\nt\nh\na\nt\n\nh\na\nd\n\na\nn\ny\nappa\nre\nn\nt\n\nv\na\nlu\ne\n,\n\nt\nh\ne\n\npo\nl\ni\nce\n\ns\ne\nr\nv\ne\n\nt\nh\ne\r\n    in\nte\nrests\n\no\nf\n\nan\ny\npe\nrs\no\nn\n\nw\nh\no\n\nha\ns\n\na\nn\n\nin\nte\nre\ns\nt\n\nin\n\nt\nh\ne\n\np\nr\no\npe\nrty\nan\nd\nw\nh\no\n\nlo\no\nks\n\nto\n\nt\nh\ne\n\npo\nl\ni\nc\ne\n\nto\n\ns\na\nf\ne\ng\nua\nr\nd\n\nt\nha\nt\np\nro\npe\nrty\nw\nh\ni\nle\n\nit\n\nis\n\nin\npo\nl\ni\nce\n\nc\nu\ns\nt\nod\ny\n.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nq\nu\nite\n\nw\nro\nn\ng\n\nto\n\ns\nu\ng\ng\ne\nst\n\nt\nh\na\nt\n\nt\nh\ne\non\nly in\nte\nre\ns\nt is t\nh\ne\n\npo\nl\ni\nce\n\ni\nn\nt\ne\nrest\ni\nn\n\na\nv\no\nidi\nn\ng\n\nc\ni\nv\nil\n\nlia\nb\ni\nl\ni\nty\n.\n\n[29]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, the logic of\nNicolosi\ndoes not apply in this case. The\r\n    officer had no statutory obligation to take custody of the car and store it in\r\n    a suitable place, nor was that power necessarily incidental to the officerÂ’s\r\n    common law powers in this instance, where the necessary degree of the officerÂ’s\r\n    control was more limited than in\nNicolosi\n. Here the officer did not\r\n    impound the vehicle or exercise the degree of control of the vehicle that would\r\n    have made an inventory search necessary. The police decision to call a tow\r\n    truck to remove a vehicle does not justify an inventory search in every case:\n\nR. v. Martin\n, 2012 ONSC 2298, at para.Â 36.\n\n[30]\n\nIn\r\n    sum, I am satisfied that the officerÂ’s common law authority was limited by the\r\n    real exigencies of the situation: see\nMellenthin\n. His duty obliged him\r\n    to get the car off the highway for safety reasons. There was no reasonable\r\n    basis for the officer to go on to undertake an inventory search of the car. Accordingly,\r\n    the officerÂ’s decision to inventory search the car was unreasonable and\r\n    breached the appellantÂ’s s. 8\nCharter\nright against an unreasonable\r\n    search.\n\n[31]\n\nI\r\n    now turn to consider whether the evidence generated by the search should have\r\n    been excluded by the trial judge in view of the breach.\n\nIssue 2: Did the Trial Judge Properly Apply s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\n?\n\n[32]\n\nSection\r\n    24(2) of the\nCharter\nprovides:\n\n(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court\r\n    concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any\r\n    rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded\r\n    if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the\r\n    admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice\r\n    into disrepute.\n\nThe Governing Principles\n\n[33]\n\nThe\r\n    framework for the application of s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\nis set out in\nR.Â v. Grant\n,\n2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353\n,\r\n    at para 71. The court must consider three lines of inquiry: (i) the seriousness\r\n    of the\nCharter\n-infringing state conduct; (ii) the impact on the\nCharter\n-protected\r\n    interests of the accused; and (iii) societyÂ’s interest in adjudication on the\r\n    merits.\n\nThe Principles Applied\n\n[34]\n\nThe\r\n    totality of the trial judgeÂ’s reasoning on the\nGrant\nanalysis is found\r\n    at para. 156:\n\n[G]iven that the vehicle was not, but for the marijuana found\r\n    in the inventory search, going to be impounded, I find that Constable Sinclair\r\n    acted in good faith and, as in\nNolet\n, it was a technical breach with\r\n    minimal impact on the\nCharter\n-protected interests of the accused as\r\n    there is a lower expectation of privacy on the public roadway. The marijuana is\r\n    real evidence and its admission would not bring the administration of justice\r\n    into disrepute.\n\n[35]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant concedes that the third line of inquiry Â– societyÂ’s interest in\r\n    adjudication on the merits Â– favours inclusion of the evidence because the\r\n    marijuana is real and reliable evidence of drug trafficking. But the appellant\r\n    argues that the first two lines of inquiry favour exclusion.\n\nThe First\nGrant\nLine of Inquiry\n\n[36]\n\nIn\nGrant\n, the Supreme Court noted, at para. 72, that the function of the\r\n    first line of inquiry into the \&quot;seriousness of the\nCharter\n-infringing\r\n    state conduct\&quot; is:\n\nto assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the\r\n    administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public\r\n    that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice,\r\n    effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to\r\n    dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct.\n\n[37]\n\nThe\r\n    focus is on the nature and degree of police misconduct. The Court stated at\r\n    para. 72:\n\n[T]he more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to\r\n    the\nCharter\nviolation, the greater the need for the Courts to\r\n    dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that\r\n    conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence\r\n    to the rule of law.\n\nBad Faith\n\n[38]\n\nAt\n\ntrial,\n\nthe\n\nappellant\n\nchallenged\n\nConstable\n\nSinclairÂ’s\n\ntestimony\n\nthat\n\nhe had\n\nalready\r\n    driven\n\naway\n\nby\n\nthe\n\ntime\n\nthe\n\nofficer discovered\n\nthe\n\nexpired\n\nlicence. The appellant\n\nargued\n\nthat\r\n    the officer\n\nhad\n\nintentionally\n\nheld\n\noff\n\nfrom\n\nspeaking\n\nto\nhim\nat\n\nthe\n\ngas\n\npumps\n\nabout\r\n    his\n\nsuspended\n\nlicence\n\nbecause\n\nhe\n\nwanted\r\n    to pull\n\nthe car\n\nover\n\non\n\nthe highway\n\nin\n\norder\n\nto arrest him and search his vehicle. The\r\n    appellant submitted the trial judge erred in failing to rule on, or to provide\r\n    sufficient reasons about, the argument that the police had used this stratagem.\n\n[39]\n\nI\r\n    would reject this argument. In concluding that the police officer was acting in\r\n    good faith throughout, the trial judge showed that she had accepted his\r\n    evidence about the timing of the licence plate search and the appellantÂ’s\r\n    apprehension, and rejected the appellantÂ’s credibility challenge to that evidence.\r\n    The appellant has not demonstrated that the trial judge committed a palpable\r\n    and overriding error in doing so.\n\nA Pattern of Abuse\n\n[40]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant argues that Constable Sinclair exhibits a pattern of abusing his\r\n    search authority as a police officer, and that this militates in favour of\r\n    exclusion of the evidence: see\nR. v. Little\n, [2009] O.J. No. 3385, at\r\n    para. 17. The appellant points to two other reported cases where Constable\r\n    Sinclair was found to have abused his search powers leading to the exclusion of\r\n    evidence.\n\n[41]\n\nIn\nR. v. Rodrigue\n, 2012 ONSC 1739, [2012] O.J. No. 1538, Constable\r\n    Sinclair intercepted another Quebec licensed vehicle, pulled it over, searched\r\n    it and found drugs. The trial judge found that the officer had no reasonable\r\n    grounds to pull over the motorist and that the subsequent search was abusive.\r\n    The trial judge cited\nHarrison\nand excluded the marijuana on the basis\r\n    of the officerÂ’s deliberate and flagrant violation of Mr. Rodrigue's rights.\n\n[42]\n\nIn\nR. v. Nguyen\n, [2011] O.J. No. 6252 (S.C.), Constable Sinclair was in a\r\n    Highway 401 On Route and saw the accused behaving \&quot;suspiciously\&quot;. He\r\n    pulled over the vehicle and noticed an air freshener and cigarettes. Constable\r\n    Sinclair asked for permission to search the vehicle. He got the accused, a Vietnamese\r\n    immigrant who did not speak English well, to sign a waiver. He then found over\r\n    $100,000 in cash and charged the accused with possession of proceeds of crime. The\r\n    judge found the waiver was not informed due to the significant language\r\n    barrier. The Crown conceded s. 24(2) exclusion.\n\n[43]\n\nAs noted, Constable Sinclair testified that he always searches\r\n    cars that he stops. He\n\nwas\n\nan\n\ninstructor\n\nin\n\nÂ“pipeline\n\ntechniquesÂ”\nand\n\ntaught police\r\n    officers and others the skills\n\nto\n\nÂ“recognize\n\nindicia\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ncriminal\n\nelement\n\nin\n\ntraffic enforcementÂ”\n\nduring\n\nÂ“traffic stopsÂ”.\r\n    He\n\ntestified\n\nthat Highway\n\n401\n\nwas\n\na\n\npopular\n\nroute for drug\n\nand\n\nweapons\n\ntraffickers\n\nand\n\nthat\n\nhe\r\n    was\n\nalways\n\nalive\n\nto possible\n\ncriminal\n\nactivity\n\nwhen\n\nconducing\n\ntraffic stops.\nHe testified that,\r\n    as a member of the East Region Highway Enforcement Team, he had been involved\r\n    in over 100 investigations involving large quantities of marijuana. In his\r\n    testimony Constable Sinclair agreed that he is Â“really good at finding ways to\r\n    search motor vehiclesÂ”, adding, however, that he does so Â“lawfullyÂ”.\n\n[44]\n\nI\r\n    do not doubt that Constable Sinclair believes that he is doing the right thing,\r\n    and to that extent shows good faith. But, to borrow the words of MacPherson\r\n    J.A. in\nR. v. MacDonald\n, 2012 ONCA 495, [2012] O.J. No. 3210, at para.\r\n    35, Constable SinclairÂ’s invariable practice of searching every car fits the\r\n    description of an impermissible Â“fishing expedition conducted at a random\r\n    highway stop\&quot;. As an instructor of other police officers, he ought to be\r\n    fully conversant with his legal authority, but the evidence shows either that\r\n    he was not or that he was prepared to search regardless. His attitude was\r\n    exemplified by his testimony: he resisted the notion that what he did was a\r\n    Â“searchÂ”: Â“I do an inventory sir, not a searchÂ”. This was plainly a search.\n\n[45]\n\nIn my view, the first line of inquiry under\nGrant\ntherefore\r\n    militates in favour of the exclusion of the evidence obtained in violation of\r\n    the appellantÂ’s s. 8 rights. I am satisfied that the state conduct in this case\r\n    falls on the serious end of the spectrum of misconduct described by Doherty\r\n    J.A. in\nR. v. Kitaitchik\n,\n[2002] O.J. No. 2476\n,166\r\n    C.C.C. (3d) 14 (C.A.), at para. 41.\n\n\nThe Second\nGrant\nLine of Inquiry\n\n[46]\n\nThe\r\n    second\nGrant\n\nline of inquiry \&quot;calls for an evaluation of\r\n    the extent to which the breach actually undermined the interests protected by\r\n    the right infringed (para 76).\&quot; The relevant right here is to be free from\r\n    unreasonable search under s. 8 of the\nCharter\n. In that context,\r\n    \&quot;[a]n unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual\r\n    reasonably enjoys a high expectation of privacy, or that demeans his or her\r\n    dignity, is more serious than one that does not\&quot;: see\nGrant\n, at\n\npara. 78.\n\n[47]\n\nThe\r\n    case law has consistently held that drivers have a reduced expectation of\r\n    privacy in their vehicles: see\nCaslake\n, at para. 15;\nNicolosi\n,\n\nat para. 9. However, a reduced expectation\r\n    of privacy does not mean that an unjustified search is permissible. As stated\r\n    by McLachlin C.J. in\nHarrison\n, Â“[a]\nperson in the\r\n    appellant's position has every expectation of being left alone - subject, as\r\n    already noted, to valid highway traffic stopsÂ”:\n\nHarrison\n,\nat paras. 31-32.\n\n[48]\n\nAs\r\n    Iacobucci J. noted in\nR. v. Mann\n, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at\r\n    para. 56, the impact of even a minimally intrusive search Â“must be weighed\r\n    against the absence of\nany\nreasonable basis for\r\n    justificationÂ”. There was no justification for Constable SinclairÂ’s inventory\r\n    search. I am satisfied the second\nGrant\nfactor also militates in\r\n    favour of the exclusion of the evidence in this case.\n\nThe Third\nGrant\nLine of Inquiry\n\n[49]\n\nThe\r\n    third line of inquiry in the\nGrant\nanalysis involves a consideration\r\n    and weighing of society's interest in the determination of the charges on their\r\n    merits. The court must consider whether \&quot;the truth-seeking function of the\r\n    criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or\r\n    by its exclusion\&quot;:\nGrant\n, at para. 79.\n\n[50]\n\nThe\r\n    exclusion of the hard evidence found in the car would gut the prosecution. That\r\n    evidence is conceded by the appellant to be highly reliable. At para. 83 of\nGrant\n,\r\n    the Court noted that \&quot;the exclusion of highly reliable evidence may impact\r\n    more negatively on the repute of the administration of justice where the remedy\r\n    effectively guts the prosecution.\&quot;\n\n[51]\n\nHowever,\r\n    I am mindful of the caution referred to by the Supreme Court, at para. 40 of\nHarrison\n,\r\n    in endorsing the words of Cronk J.A.:\n\nAllowing the seriousness of the offence and the reliability of\r\n    the evidence to overwhelm the s. 24(2) analysis \&quot;would deprive those\r\n    charged with serious crimes of the protection of the individual freedoms\r\n    afforded to all Canadians under the\nCharter\nand, in effect, declare\r\n    that in the administration of the criminal law 'the ends justify the means.'Â”\n\n[52]\n\nIn\nHarrison\n, the Supreme Court acquitted the appellant, where an illegal\r\n    roadside search found 35 kg of cocaine, a far more dangerous drug. The court\r\n    did so, as it noted at para. 37, on the basis that the trial judge had placed\r\n    undue emphasis on the third line of inquiry, and had turned the analysis into a\r\n    contest between the degree of the police misconduct and the seriousness of the\r\n    offence, or, as McLachlin C.J. noted at para 41, Â“between the misdeeds of the\r\n    police and those of the accusedÂ”.\n\n[53]\n\nAs\r\n    Cory J. observed in\nMellenthin\n, at para. 27:\n\nThe unreasonable search carried out in this case is the very\r\n    kind which the Court wished to make clear is unacceptable. A check stop does\r\n    not and cannot constitute a general search warrant for searching every vehicle,\r\n    driver and passenger that is pulled over. Unless there are reasonable and\r\n    probable grounds for conducting the search, or drugs, alcohol or weapons are in\r\n    plain view in the interior of the vehicle, the evidence flowing from such a\r\n    search should not be admitted.\n\n[54]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, the third\nGrant\nfactor cannot be used to systematically\r\n    require the admission of reliable evidence obtained in plain disregard of an\r\n    accusedÂ’s\nCharter\nrights. This is a case in which s. 24(2) of the\nCharter\nmust be applied so as to ensure that the administration of justice is not\r\n    undermined by the admission of evidence obtained in violation of an accusedÂ’s\nCharter\nrights.\n\n[55]\n\nI\r\n    am mindful of the Supreme CourtÂ’s caution in\nGrant\nthat where the\r\n    trial judge has considered the three lines of inquiry, appellate courts should\r\n    defer to the trial judgeÂ’s ultimate decision. Deference is not warranted in\r\n    this case because the trial judgeÂ’s reasoning on the application of s. 24(2) of\r\n    the\n\nCharter\nwas sparse, deficient and erroneous in material\r\n    ways.\n\n[56]\n\nThe\r\n    trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence should not be excluded. Her\r\n    classification of the s. 8 breach as Â“technical,Â” as described in\nNolet\n,\r\n    was incorrect. In\nNolet\n, the breach was considered Â“technicalÂ” because\r\n    the fruits of the illegal search would have been discovered if the police had continued\r\n    their prior lawful search:\nNolet\n, at para. 54. Here, Constable\r\n    Sinclair had no authority to conduct any type of search of the interior of the\r\n    vehicle. The trial judge further erred by holding that the impact of this\r\n    breach was Â“minimalÂ” simply because the appellant had a lower expectation of\r\n    privacy in his vehicle on a public roadway. The impact of an unjustified search\r\n    is magnified where there is a total absence of justification for it.\n\nDisposition\n\n[57]\n\nTaking together the three\nGrant\nlines of inquiry, I\r\n    conclude that the evidence should be excluded. The state misconduct was serious\r\n    and the impact on the appellantÂ’s\nCharter\nrights was significant. As\r\n    McLachlin C.J. observed in\nHarrison\n, at para. 42, Â“\nthe price paid by society for an acquittal in these circumstances\r\n    is outweighed by the importance of maintaining\nCharter\nstandardsÂ”.\n\n[58]\n\nI would allow the appeal, exclude the evidence obtained in\r\n    violation of the appellantÂ’s\nCharter\nrights.\nBecause the evidence in question was essential to the Crown's\r\n    case, rather than order a new trial, I would enter an acquittal, as the Supreme\r\n    Court did in\nHarrison\n.\n\nReleased: April 6, 2016 Â“DWÂ”\n\nÂ“P.\r\n    Lauwers J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“I\r\n    agree David Watt J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“I\r\n    agree G.

Anderson of the Ontario\r\n    Court of Justice.\n\nENDORSEMENT\n\n[1]\n\nThe appellant appeals her conviction of possession of 48 pounds of\r\n    marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and seeks leave to appeal her sentence\r\n    of imprisonment for a term of six months imposed as a result of that\r\n    conviction.\n\n[2]\n\nThe appellant was the driver of a sport utility vehicle that was pulled\r\n    over by a police officer on Highway 401 in Eastern Ontario. In a cardboard box\r\n    in the cargo area of the vehicle, police located several bags of packaged marijuana.\n\n[3]\n\nThe genesis of the traffic stop was a report from another police officer\r\n    about unsafe driving and observations by the arresting officer who followed the\r\n    vehicle for several kilometers. The officer who stopped the vehicle approached\r\n    it. He made several observations as he waited for the occupants, in particular\r\n    the appellant, to produce information he requested of them. Both occupants\r\n    seemed nervous. The appellant kept looking back towards two large black\r\n    suitcases in the rear of the vehicle. There were several cellphones on the\r\n    console. The officer detected a strong smell of raw marijuana from the vehicle.\r\n    As he walked by the vehicle to return to his cruiser, the officer noticed a\r\n    cardboard box with Ziploc bags protruding from it containing material of the\r\n    shape and size of marijuana. He made this observation through heavily tinted\r\n    windows.\n\n[4]\n\nOn his return to his cruiser, the officer conducted a CPIC check on his\r\n    computer. He returned to the vehicle driven by the appellant and arrested the\r\n    appellant and her passenger on a charge of possession of marijuana for the\r\n    purpose of trafficking.\n\n[5]\n\nThe appellant advances three grounds of appeal against conviction. She says\r\n    that the trial judge erred:\n\n\ni.\n\nin failing to find that the\r\n    police lacked reasonable grounds to detain the appellant and thereby lacked the\r\n    authority to search the vehicle incident to her arrest;\n\n\nii.\n\nin failing to exclude the marijuana\r\n    as evidence obtained by\nCharter\ninfringement under s.24(2) of the\nCharter\n;\r\n    and\n\n\niii.\n\nin misapprehending the evidence\r\n    of the arresting officer and thereby rendering an unreasonable verdict based on\r\n    his evidence.\n\n[6]\n\nWe would not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal.\n\n[7]\n\nWe are satisfied, as the appellant acknowledges, that the initial\r\n    traffic stop was fully justified under s. 216(1) of the\nHighway Traffic Act\n.\r\n    The same may be said of the request for documents identifying the occupants and\r\n    the authority of the driver to operate the vehicle with appropriate insurance\r\n    coverage. Any additional purpose the officer had was neither improper nor did\r\n    it entail an infringement on the liberty or security of the occupants beyond\r\n    what is contemplated by the purpose animating s.216(1) of the\nHighway\r\n    Traffic Act\n. See,\nBrown v. Regional Municipality of Durham Police\r\n    Service Board\n, (1998) 116 O.A.C. 126, at para. 31.\n\n[8]\n\nWe are equally satisfied that the trial judge made no error in\r\n    concluding that the investigating officer had reasonable and probable grounds\r\n    to arrest the appellant for possession of marijuana.\n\n[9]\n\nWhen the officer reached the vehicle, he detected a strong odour of raw\r\n    marijuana. New air fresheners hung from the rear-view mirror. Several\r\n    cellphones were in the vehicle. Both occupants were nervous. The appellant repeatedly\r\n    looked back at the large bags in the rear seat or cargo area. The officer\r\n    noticed a large box with bags containing a substance that resembled marijuana\r\n    in size and shape protruding from it. The cumulative effect of these\r\n    observations amounted to reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the\r\n    appellant. It followed that the search of the vehicle incident to the lawful\r\n    arrest and carried out in a reasonable manner was constitutionally valid.\n\n[10]\n\nThe\r\n    trial judge found a breach of s.10(b) when the arresting officer did not inform\r\n    the appellant of her s.10(b) rights immediately upon arrest. The informational\r\n    component of the right was delayed three to four minutes. The trial judge\r\n    rejected the appellantÂ’s claim that she did not speak to a lawyer, rather only to\r\n    an interpreter, after the investigating officer called the toll-free number for\r\n    duty counsel advice and, in accordance with his usual practice, requested a\r\n    response from a Vietnamese-speaking lawyer. We see no basis upon which to interfere\r\n    with this finding or the trial judgeÂ’s decision to admit the real evidence\r\n    found in the vehicle.\n\n[11]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant also seeks leave to appeal the sentence of imprisonment for a term of\r\n    six months imposed upon her. She says the trial judge erred in failing to\r\n    impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment. The sentence imposed at trial,\r\n    she contends, is demonstrably unfit for a 52 year-old first offender, the sole\r\n    support of her daughter, a university student. A conditional sentence order\r\n    would permit her to continue operating her business, to maintain her home, and\r\n    would also achieve the predominant sentencing objectives.\n\n[12]\n\nWe\r\n    would not interfere with the sentence imposed at trial. We measure the sentence\r\n    imposed for its adherence to the cardinal principle of sentencing Â–proportionality\r\n    Â– regardless of whether trial judge erred in principle when crafting it. We see\r\n    no error in principle in the judgeÂ’s approach or any misapprehension of\r\n    relevant evidence, let alone any error that had an impact on the sentence\r\n    ultimately imposed.\n\n[13]\n\nThe\r\n    offence involved a significant quantity of marijuana. The crime was motivated\r\n    entirely by financial gain. The offender who committed it, by her own\r\n    admission, gave perjured testimony on the\nvoir dire\n, if not on the\r\n    trial proper in a desperate effort to escape conviction.\n\n[14]\n\nThe\r\n    appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but\r\n    the appeal from sentence is dismissed.\n\nÂ“David Watt J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“Gloria Epstein J.A.Â”\n\nÂ”M.

Garg, for the respondent\n\nHeard and released orally: April 12, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the sentence imposed on December 23, 2014\r\n    by Justice\nRichard E. Jennis\nof the Ontario Court of\r\n    Justice.\n\nENDORSEMENT\n\n[1]\n\nThe appellant appeals a net or effective sentence of 3 years, 7 months\r\n    imposed after he pleaded guilty to a single count of robbery.\n\n[2]\n\nThe sentencing judge considered that a sentence of 4 years, 10 months\r\n    was fit for the robbery conviction, but reduced it to 3 years, 7 months because\r\n    of the time the appellant had spent in pre-disposition custody which the\r\n    sentencing judge credited at the rate of 1.25:1.\n\n[3]\n\nAt the same time, the sentencing judge imposed sentences of one month on\r\n    each of two counts of theft under $5,000, upon which the Crown proceeded by\r\n    indictment. The sentences were made consecutive to each other, and to the\r\n    sentence imposed on the robbery conviction. Neither the quantum of those\r\n    sentences, nor the order that they be served consecutively to each other and to\r\n    the robbery sentence, is in issue on appeal.\n\n[4]\n\nBefore the sentencing judge, Crown counsel sought a penitentiary\r\n    sentence of 4 to 8 years, less credit for pre-disposition custody. Defence\r\n    counsel sought a sentence that would permit service of it in a reformatory so\r\n    that the appellant could receive the benefit of substance abuse programs said\r\n    to be more effective there than in the penitentiary.\n\n[5]\n\nThe appellant advances two grounds of appeal. He says that the\r\n    sentencing judge erred in failing to award him credit on a 1.5:1 basis for the\r\n    time he spent in pre-disposition custody. Second, he contends that the\r\n    sentencing judge erred in the quantum of sentence he imposed by placing undue\r\n    weight on the appellantÂ’s criminal record.\n\n[6]\n\nThe respondent acknowledges that the sentencing judge erred in failing\r\n    to award credit for pre-disposition custody at the rate of 1.5:1, but submits\r\n    that the sentence imposed is otherwise free of error. In fairness to the\r\n    sentencing judge, he based his conclusion on this issue on a decision of this\r\n    court that was overtaken by subsequent authority not available to the\r\n    sentencing judge at the time he imposed sentence.\n\n[7]\n\nApart from awarding enhanced credit for pre-disposition custody, we\r\n    would dismiss the appeal.\n\n[8]\n\nIn light of\nR. v. Lacasse\n, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, we\r\n    are permitted to intervene with a sentence imposed at first instance only where\r\n    the sentencing judge has erred in principle; failed to consider a relevant factor;\r\n    or erred in his or her consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor;\r\n    and that such an error had an impact on the sentence imposed.\n\n[9]\n\nThe assignment of weight to aggravating and mitigating factors in\r\n    determining a fit sentence is quintessentially a matter for the sentencing\r\n    judge. Here, the sentencing judge was dealing with a mature recidivist with\r\n    nearly seven dozen convictions on a record that spanned almost a quarter-century.\r\n    The offence committed was a brazen and planned robbery accompanied by the use\r\n    of an imitation weapon. Deterrence and denunciation dominated the sentencing\r\n    calculus. The sentencing judge considered rehabilitation but accorded it, as he\r\n    was entitled to do, a place of lesser influence.\n\n[10]\n\nApart from adjusting the pre-disposition custody credit, we see no reason\r\n    to interfere with this sentence.\n\n[11]\n\nWe reduce the\nremanet\nof this sentence by 94 days to reflect\r\n    the credit of 1.5:1, rather than 1.25:1. This leaves a net sentence on the\r\n    robbery conviction of 3 years, 5 months and 15 days. Otherwise the appeal, from\r\n    sentence is dismissed.\n\nÂ“Doherty J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“David Watt J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“B.W.

He submits that the opinion of his treating physician that he had\r\n    made progress in the recent year, and that he would benefit from a less secure\r\n    environment should have been accepted by the Board. He would like to be\r\n    transferred to either the Brockville Mental Health Centre or the Royal Ottawa\r\n    Mental Health Centre, so that he can be closer to his family, and so that he\r\n    can enjoy some easing of the restrictions associated with Waypoint. The\r\n    appellant had spent time at the Brockville facility in the past.\n\n[2]\n\nDr. Ahmed, member of the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre, opposed the\r\n    transfer. He reviewed the hospital report filed in this matter and took the\r\n    position that the appellantÂ’s risk Â“continues to be at a level higher than can\r\n    be safely managedÂ” at those facilities. He did not consider that the appellant\r\n    had made any significant progress and was concerned that as a result of a\r\n    program of major renovation, there was a reduction of beds available for\r\n    admission.\n\n[3]\n\nThere was no dispute that the appellant remained a significant threat,\r\n    and no dispute that continued hospitalization was required.\n\n[4]\n\nThe Board noted in its reasons, Â“While the Board commends Mr.Â Quenneville\r\n    for his progress during the review period, we find that a transfer to a less\r\n    secure institution is premature given Mr. QuennevilleÂ’s ongoing threatening and\r\n    sexually inappropriate behaviour as documented in the Hospital ReportÂ”. That\r\n    report discloses that the appellant continued to make threats to kill, torture,\r\n    rape and injure other persons. His last violent outburst occurred in June 2014\r\n    when he threw a 70 pound chair in his room which broke off a door handle.\n\n[5]\n\nThe reasons of the Board are adequate, clearly explaining why it came to\r\n    the conclusions it did.\n\n[6]\n\nThe appellant was making some progress at Waypoint with the benefit of\r\n    Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. There was some question whether the same kind\r\n    of treatment would be available to him at the other institutions.\n\n[7]\n\nThe BoardÂ’s decision is owed deference. As recently observed by this\r\n    court in\nHart (Re)\n, 2016 ONCA 277:\n\nThe standard of review of a disposition or placement decision\r\n    of the Board is set out in s. 672.78(1) of the\nCriminal Code\n, and its\r\n    application was explained in\nR. v Owen\n, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R.\r\n    779, at paras. 31-37. This court can only set aside an order of the Board where\r\n    it is of the opinion that:\n\n1. the decision is unreasonable or cannot be supported by\r\n    the evidence; or\n\n2. the decision is based on a wrong decision on a question\r\n    of law; or\n\n3. there was a miscarriage of justice.\n\n[8]\n\nThe conclusion that it was premature to transfer the appellant to a less\r\n    secure setting was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was open to the\r\n    Board to accept the evidence favouring continued detention at Waypoint rather\r\n    than the evidence of the treating physician advocating a transfer. There is no\r\n    basis for this court to intervene. The appeal is dismissed.\n\nÂ“G.R. Strathy C.J.O.Â”\n\nÂ“E.E.\r\n    Gillese J.A.Â”\n\nÂ“G.

Belobaba\r\n    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 12, 2015, reported at 2015\r\n    ONSC 632.\n\nStrathy C.J.O.:\n\n[1]\n\nThis appeal is about prepaid wireless phone card accounts. It concerns\r\n    the fate of the balance remaining in a Bell Mobility Inc. (Bell) subscriberÂ’s\r\n    account when she fails to Â“top upÂ” the account before the end of its Â“active\r\n    periodÂ”.\n\n[2]\n\nBellÂ’s prepaid Â“top-upsÂ” allow customers to add credit to their accounts\r\n    and extend their active periods that give them access to BellÂ’s wireless\r\n    network. BellÂ’s practice, during the period at issue, was to claim unused funds\r\n    the day after the end of the active period. For example, if the active period\r\n    ended on June 30, BellÂ’s practice was to claim the unused funds on July 1, if the\r\n    account had not been topped-up in order to extend the active period.\n\n[3]\n\nThe appellantÂ’s certified class action alleges that Bell collected those\r\n    funds improperly. She claims the contract provided that Bell had to wait until the\r\n    second day after the end of the active period, not the first day. Alternatively,\r\n    she alleges, Bell claimed funds improperly because Ontario legislation forbids\r\n    the imposition of expiry dates on prepaid phone cards.\n\n[4]\n\nThe motion judge ruled that Bell did not breach its contract and that\r\n    the gift card regulations found in O. Reg. 17/05, as amended (the\nGift Card\r\n    Regulation\n)\n[1]\n,\r\n    under the\nConsumer Protection Act\n,\n2002\n,\nS.O. 2002, c.\r\n    30 Sched. A, do not apply to prepaid phone cards. He therefore granted summary\r\n    judgment answering the common issues in BellÂ’s favour and dismissed the class\r\n    action.\n\n[5]\n\nThe appellant challenges the motion judgeÂ’s conclusions on both issues.\r\n    She asserts that the motion judge failed to consider the prepaid wireless\r\n    contract as a whole, having regard to the expiry dates assigned by Bell and\r\n    communicated to subscribers. She also submits that the motion judge erred in\r\n    finding that the\nGift Card Regulation\nis inapplicable to BellÂ’s phone\r\n    cards.\n\n[6]\n\nFor the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\nA.\n\nBreach of contract claim\n\n[7]\n\nBell markets prepaid cell phone services under three brand names: Bell\r\n    Mobility, Solo Mobile, and Virgin Mobile. As the motion judge noted, and here I\r\n    borrow liberally from his reasons, Bell offered different active periods and\r\n    pricing for its three brands. The active periods ranged from 30 to 365 days and\r\n    the cost of credits that could be purchased ranged from $15 to $200, depending\r\n    on the length of the active period. Generally, the longer the active period the\r\n    more the card cost and the greater the credits that could be applied against\r\n    particular Bell services during the active period. Thus, customers could choose\r\n    a plan to suit their budgets and anticipated usage.\n\n[8]\n\nAll plans had an active period. At the end of the active period access\r\n    to BellÂ’s services terminated unless the plan was renewed. If not, the prepaid\r\n    credits expired and were forfeited to Bell. If the customer Â“topped upÂ” the\r\n    prepaid account balance before expiry, the unused balance was added to the new\r\n    top-up and became subject to the new active period.\n\n[9]\n\nThere were different ways to top up the account. Customers could pre-authorize\r\n    the automatic top-up of their accounts through their credit or debit cards when\r\n    the balance fell below a certain floor or was about to expire. Or, they could\r\n    Â“manuallyÂ” top up with a credit card through the brandÂ’s web site or by\r\n    purchasing a phone card from a retainer. Virgin Mobile customers could also\r\n    Â“manuallyÂ” top up with a debit card. When customers topped up their accounts,\r\n    they received a PIN (personal identification number) receipt, containing a\r\n    unique code. When the customer wished to activate the top up, she could enter\r\n    the code on the brandÂ’s website or by text or other communication to Bell, thereby\r\n    adding the top up value to the balance in the prepaid account.\n\n[10]\n\nThe\r\n    focus of this action is the manual form of top up through the purchase of\r\n    prepaid cards and PIN receipts.\n\n[11]\n\nThe\r\n    relevant portion of the Bell Mobility and Solo Mobile terms of service were as\r\n    follows:\n\nValue deposited into your prepaid account is available as\r\n    prepaid credits for your Service and such credits are non-refundable,\r\n    non-transferable, and will expire after a specified time period.\n\n[12]\n\nThe\r\n    Virgin Mobile terms of service stated the following:\n\nAll Top Ups ... have specified active periods and an expiry\r\n    date. The active period starts on the date you place the Top Up on your\r\n    account. Any Top Up balance on your account after the expiry date is forfeited\r\n    and non-refundable. If you Top Up your account before your existing credit\r\n    expires or is used up, then your existing credit is added to the new Top Up\r\n    value and the active period of the earlier Top Up is extended so that the later\r\n    expiry date of the two Top Ups is valid for the entire amount.\n\n[13]\n\nThe\r\n    motion judge relied on certain additional materials in his interpretation of\r\n    the agreements.\n\n[14]\n\nFirst,\r\n    as I have noted, the prepaid cards sold by retailers for these brands provided\r\n    for different pricing and active periods. The cards used different terminology\r\n    to describe the active period. Bell Mobility and Solo Mobile cards stated, for\r\n    example, Â“$15 valid for 30 days.Â” Virgin Mobile cards said, for example, Â“Funds\r\n    expire, $15 Â– 30 days after activation.Â”\n\n[15]\n\nSecond,\r\n    the PIN receipt customers received on payment for the card or top-up,\r\n    stipulated, for example, Â“$15 valid 30 daysÂ” (Bell Mobility), Â“$20 Good for 45\r\n    daysÂ” (Solo Mobile), and Â“Funds expire, $15 - 30 days after activationÂ” (Virgin\r\n    Mobile).\n\n[16]\n\nThe\r\n    breach of contract claim boiled down to whether the prepaid card expired at the\r\n    end of the last day of the active period, or the day after. If the card did not\r\n    expire until the day after the end of the active period, then Bell had breached\r\n    its contract by treating the purchaser as having forfeited the unused balance on\r\n    that day. In my view, the motion judge correctly held that the card expired at\r\n    the end of the last day of the active period, not on the day after. Bell was\r\n    therefore entitled to collect the unused balance after the last day of the\r\n    active period.\n\n[17]\n\nThe\r\n    motion judge found that, at the time of contracting, Bell intended, and\r\n    subscribers understood, that the agreement would expire at the end of the\r\n    relevant active period. They understood that any unused funds would be claimed\r\n    by Bell after that time, unless the account was Â“topped upÂ” before expiry. The\r\n    information on the prepaid cards and the PIN receipts was consistent with the\r\n    language of the subscriber agreements, with brand brochures and pamphlets\r\n    available at retailers and with the information on BellÂ’s websites.\n\n[18]\n\nWhile\r\n    this matter was under reserve, this court released its decision in\nMacDonald\r\n    v. Chicago Title Insurance Company of Canada\n, 2015 ONCA 842. The court held\r\n    that the standard of review applicable to a standard form insurance policy was\r\n    correctness. The appellant sought leave to make further submissions on the\r\n    application of the decision and the court granted leave to both parties to do\r\n    so.\n\n[19]\n\nBased\r\n    on\nChicago Title\n, the appellant submits that the standard of review is\r\n    correctness, because BellÂ’s contracts are standard form contracts of adhesion. She\r\n    submits that the factual matrix should have played no role in the\r\n    interpretation of the contact. The motion judge should not have relied on\r\n    extrinsic materials, such as PIN receipts, phone cards, brochures and websites\r\n    to interpret the contract. Instead, the appellant says, the motion judge should\r\n    have considered subsequent communications from Bell to its customers, in which Bell\r\n    set out the expiry dates of their cards.\n\n[20]\n\nBell,\r\n    on the other hand, submits that the contract terms were contained not only in\r\n    the agreements made when customers initially signed up for wireless service,\r\n    but also in pricing and other contractual information, including expiry dates, set\r\n    out in the prepaid cards and PIN receipts, which customers obtained when they\r\n    bought top-ups. Bell says that the motion judge properly considered these\r\n    documents, and others, in interpreting the contract. It also says that the\r\n    motion judge rightly ignored communications made by Bell after customers had made\r\n    their pre-payments.\n\n[21]\n\nBell\r\n    says that because the motion judge was entitled to rely on the factual matrix\r\n    in this way, the standard of review should be one of palpable and overriding\r\n    error.\n\n[22]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, in addition to the initial agreements, the motion judge was entitled\r\n    to rely on other documents that formed part of the contractual relationship\r\n    between the parties Â– the PIN receipts and phone cards referred to earlier. These,\r\n    taken together with the agreements made when they subscribed to the service,\r\n    formed the contract between every customer and Bell. It was appropriate to\r\n    answer the common issue based on these documents and indeed the answer would\r\n    have been incomplete had they not been considered.\n\n[23]\n\nThere\r\n    is a difference between considering the factual matrix and considering the\r\n    documents that make up the contract itself. It is not uncommon in modern\r\n    contracts, including contracts made partly on Â“paperÂ” and partly on the internet,\r\n    for the contract terms to be found in several Â“documentsÂ”. And it is well-settled\r\n    that where parties enter into interrelated agreements, the court is required to\r\n    look to all those agreements to determine their construction.\n\n[24]\n\nThus\r\n    in\n3869130 Canada Inc. v. I.C.B. Distribution Inc\n., 2008 ONCA 396, this\r\n    court stated that a court may have regard to the language of other contracts\r\n    made at the same time. It quoted with approval from John D. McCamus, The Law of\r\n    Contracts (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2005), at p. 715:\n\nMany transactions, especially large commercial transactions\r\n    such as the purchase and sale of a large and complex business, may involve the\r\n    execution of several agreements. In such contexts, it is an interesting\r\n    question, then, whether in the interpretation of one of the agreements, regard\r\n    may be had to the others.\nThe basic principle is that such regard may be had\r\n    only where the agreements essentially form components of one larger\r\n    transaction. Where each agreement is entered into on the faith of the others\r\n    being executed and where it is intended that each agreement form part of a\r\n    larger composite whole, assistance in the interpretation of any particular\r\n    agreement may be drawn from the related agreements.\n[Emphasis added.\r\n    Citation omitted.]\n\n[25]\n\nIn\r\n    this case, the agreements were not contemporaneous, but they were interrelated.\r\n    The initial agreement contemplated that customers would top up their accounts\r\n    through BellÂ’s websites, through the purchase of phone cards and through the\r\n    purchase of PIN receipts. These were not simply part of the factual matrix Â– they\r\n    contained contractual terms themselves. The motion judge properly had regard to\r\n    these documents in order to determine the contract terms. Because these terms\r\n    were common to all class members (albeit in slightly different language\r\n    depending on the manner of top-up), it was appropriate to address the issue as\r\n    a common issue.\n\n[26]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, based on\nSattva\nand\nChicago Title\n, a correctness\r\n    standard applies to the interpretation of the Bell contracts, which included\r\n    standard terms of service and standard form phone cards and PIN receipts. The\r\n    factual matrix applicable to the dealings between individual customers and Bell\r\n    plays no role in the interpretation of the contracts. Indeed, if that did play\r\n    any role, the interpretation of the contract would not be a suitable common\r\n    issue, because the answer could vary depending on the underlying facts.\n\n[27]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant says that the motion judge should have considered the text messages\r\n    and other communications made by Bell to its customers prior to the expiry of\r\n    their top-ups to notify them that their funds were about to expire. But these\r\n    communications took place after the contract had been made. As the motion judge\r\n    properly found, at para 28:\n\nIf any class member misunderstood the follow-up\r\n    \&quot;expiration date\&quot; messages as meaning that unused funds would expire\r\n    on Day 31 and would be seized on Day 32, and she relied on said messages to her\r\n    detriment (by not topping up in time and forfeiting the unused balance) and the\r\n    defendant did not grant a courtesy extension, then her remedy, as already\r\n    noted, was two-fold: either a claim in breach of contract arguing promissory\r\n    estoppel or a claim in misrepresentation. But both of these remedies would\r\n    require proof of individual reliance and neither would be amenable to a class\r\n    proceeding. That is why, as I have already noted, neither promissory estoppel\r\n    nor misrepresentation was alleged by the plaintiff or pursued herein.\n\n[28]\n\nThese\r\n    communications were not part of the factual matrix surrounding the formation of\r\n    the contract. At their highest, they were post-contractual representations.\n\n[29]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, the motion judgeÂ’s interpretation of the contract was correct. It was\r\n    based on BellÂ’s Terms and Conditions of Service and other documents available\r\n    at the time of contracting and the ordinary, grammatical and common sense\r\n    meaning of the contract language.\n\n[30]\n\nThe\r\n    plain meaning of the language on the prepaid cards and the PIN receipts, when\r\n    read in context of the agreements made by customers when they initially subscribed\r\n    for the service, was, as the motion judge found, that the subscriberÂ’s ability\r\n    to use the prepaid funds expired at the end of the relevant active period.\n\n[31]\n\nIndeed,\r\n    the appellantÂ’s complaint to the CRTC confirmed that she understood from the\r\n    contract documents that her account would expire at the end of the relevant\r\n    period if it was not topped-up.\n\n[32]\n\nAs\r\n    the motion judge noted, the appellantÂ’s real complaint, and the real complaint\r\n    in this class action, is that BellÂ’s\nsubsequent\ncommunications to its customers Â– made after they had purchased their top-ups\r\n    and as the top-up was about to expire Â– were misleading. That is because they\r\n    may have created the impression that subscribers had an additional day after\r\n    the end of the active period to Â“top upÂ” before their funds expired. I agree\r\n    with the motion judge that this was essentially a claim for misrepresentation\r\n    or promissory estoppel, neither of which was before him, because neither was held\r\n    to be amenable to resolution as a common issue in the class proceeding.\n\n[33]\n\nI\r\n    would therefore dismiss the first ground of appeal.\n\nB.\n\nGift Card Regulation\n\n[34]\n\nThe\r\n    parties made no submissions in either this court or in the court below\r\n    concerning the legislative jurisdiction of the Province of Ontario over prepaid\r\n    phone cards. The appellant submits that if Ontario has such jurisdiction, an\r\n    issue that was left for another day if necessary, the cards cannot have expiry\r\n    dates. She submits the motion judge erred in his interpretation and application\r\n    of ss. 23 and 25.1-5 of the\nGift Card Regulation\n.\n\n[35]\n\nThe\nGift Card Regulation\nis made under the\nConsumer Protection Act.\nPart\r\n    IV of that statute deals with specific consumer agreements, including Â“future\r\n    performance agreements.Â” A future performance agreement is defined in s. 1 as a\r\n    Â“consumer agreement in respect of which delivery, performance or payment in\r\n    full is not made when the parties enter the agreementÂ”. That is, as the name\r\n    suggests, an agreement that is to be wholly or partly performed in the future.\r\n    Sections 21 to 26 of the statute set out certain consumer rights in relation to\r\n    future performance agreements, none of which is applicable here.\n\n[36]\n\nThe\nGift Card Regulation\nstates the requirements for future performance\r\n    agreements generally and for Â“gift card agreementsÂ” in particular. The regulation\r\n    defines both Â“gift cardÂ” and Â“gift card agreementÂ” as follows:\n\n23.\n\nIn the Act and this Part,\n\nÂ“gift cardÂ” means a voucher in any form, including an\r\n    electronic credit or written certificate, that is issued by a supplier under a\r\n    gift card agreement and that the holder is entitled to apply towards purchasing\r\n    goods or services covered by the voucher; (Â“carte cadeauÂ”)\n\nÂ“gift card agreementÂ” means a future performance agreement\r\n    under which the supplier issues a gift card to the consumer and in respect of\r\n    which the consumer makes payment in full when entering into the agreement;\r\n    (Â“convention de carte cadeauÂ”)\n\n[37]\n\nAs\r\n    the motion judge noted, there is a degree of circularity to these definitions,\r\n    in that each term is defined partly by reference to itself.\n\n[38]\n\nThe\r\n    regulation prohibits an expiry date on the future performance of a gift card\r\n    agreement:\n\n25.3(1)\n\nNo supplier shall enter into a gift card\r\n    agreement that has an expiry date on the future performance of the agreement.\n\n25.3(2)\n\nA gift card agreement with an expiry date on its\r\n    future performance shall be effective as if it had no expiry date if the\r\n    agreement is otherwise valid.\n\n[39]\n\nBased\r\n    on the ordinary meaning of the terms Â“gift cardÂ” and Â“gift card agreement,Â” the\r\n    motion judge interpreted those terms as requiring an actual gifting of the card\r\n    or voucher to a third party. In reaching this conclusion, he held that Â“[t]here\r\n    is nothing in the language of the\nGift Card Regulation\nthat explicitly\r\n    limits or confines its application to gift cards as commonly understood.Â” He\r\n    noted, however, that in introducing the regulation, the Minister of Government\r\n    Services observed that gifts cards Â“are purchased in good faith by the people\r\n    of Ontario for their family and friends.Â”\n\n[40]\n\nHe\r\n    concluded that prepaid phone cards are generally not subject to the\nGift\r\n    Card Regulation\n, because they are purchased for personal use and not as\r\n    gifts. In his view, only if a prepaid phone card was Â“\npurchased\r\n    as a gift for a third party, [would it] qualify as a Â‘gift cardÂ’Â”.\n\n[41]\n\nHe held that even phone cards and PIN receipts purchased as gifts\r\n    for third parties would not contravene the regulation, because they did not\r\n    have expiry dates. He stated, at para. 44:\n\nThey could be redeemed, i.e. activated, at any time without\r\n    limitation. Â… And the fact that the wireless services provided thereafter were\r\n    time limited, i.e. after this particular gift card was redeemed (by\r\n    activation), is not a breach of any provision in the\nGift Card Regulation\n.\n\n[42]\n\nThe\r\n    motion judge held, in the alternative, that even if pre-paid phone cards were\r\n    Â“gift cardsÂ”, they were nonetheless exempted under s. 25.1(b) of the\nGift\r\n    Card Regulation\n, which exempts any Â“gift card that covers only one specific\r\n    good or serviceÂ” from the no expiry date provision, among others. The gift\r\n    cards here, he said, covered only one specific service: access to BellÂ’s\r\n    network.\n\n[43]\n\nThe\r\n    appellant argues that there is nothing in the legislation to show that it was\r\n    limited to future performance agreements purchased as gifts. She also says the\r\n    Bell cards are not for one specific service, but rather for a variety of\r\n    services, including voice, data, voicemail, call display, long distance,\r\n    roaming, text, picture, downloads, streaming, browser usage and internet\r\n    access. These services are priced at specific rates, which are then deducted\r\n    from the consumerÂ’s account based on usage of each service.\n\n[44]\n\nThe\r\n    respondent agrees with the motion judge and argues that access to the network\r\n    is a single service; all the other services are incidental.\n\n[45]\n\nI\r\n    do not find it necessary to address the issue of whether the\nGift Card\r\n    Regulation\napplies only to gift cards purchased as gifts. Nor is it\r\n    necessary to consider whether the case falls within the single service\r\n    exception, although there is a strong argument that the consumer is purchasing\r\n    a single service Â– access to BellÂ’s network for a defined period of time.\n\n[46]\n\nRather,\r\n    I rest my conclusion on the interpretation of the\nGift Card Regulation\n,\r\n    to which the motion judge alluded in his analysis. The regulation prohibits an\r\n    expiry date on the Â“\nfuture performance of the agreement\nÂ”. It provides\r\n    that a future performance agreement with an expiry date is to be effective Â“as\r\n    if it had no expiry dateÂ”. Its purpose is to prevent the expiry of the\r\n    agreement before the seller of the card has delivered the goods or performed\r\n    the services promised under the agreement. It does\nnot\nprohibit an\r\n    agreement being time-limited Â– for example, use of a gym for 30 days after\r\n    activation of the membership, or use of wireless services for 30, 60, 90 or 365\r\n    days after activation.\n\n[47]\n\nThe\r\n    question, therefore, is Â“what does performance of the wireless agreement\r\n    entail?Â” Does it mean that Bell performs its agreement by giving the customer\r\n    access to its wireless network for 30, 60, 90 or 365 days, or does it mean that\r\n    Bell must provide wireless service until the customer uses up all the prepaid\r\n    credits in his or her account?\n\n[48]\n\nThe\r\n    plain meaning of the contracts is that customers were buying a defined period\r\n    of wireless service. Significantly, the motion judge found, at para. 12, that Â“[a]t\r\n    no time during the class period did class members receive anything less than\r\n    the full period of wireless service for which they had contracted to receive.Â”\n\n[49]\n\nBut,\r\n    although the performance of the contract entailed a defined period, the\r\n    purchaser or donee of a Bell card or PIN receipt could decide when she wanted\r\n    to activate the service in order to begin that period. The service could be\r\n    activated at any time in the future. Bell was required to perform the agreement\r\n    once the consumer decided to activate the service. The agreement was fully performed\r\n    by Bell when it gave the customer access to its wireless services for the\r\n    agreed-on period.\n\n[50]\n\nThe\r\n    fact that the service purchased was for a defined period, calculated on the dollar\r\n    value of credits the consumer added to the account, was not a breach of the\r\n    regulation. To hold otherwise would mean that Bell was required to keep the\r\n    wireless service and number available to the customer indefinitely, a patently\r\n    unreasonable outcome. As the motion judge noted, at para. 44 of his reasons,\r\n    Â“section 25.3(1) [of the\nGift Card Regulation\n] prohibits an expiry date\r\n    on the gift card itself and not on the goods or services purchased with that\r\n    gift card.Â”\n\n[51]\n\nIt\r\n    is noteworthy, although not in any way determinative, that in establishing the\nWireless\r\n    Code\n, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)\r\n    specifically addressed this issue, after hearing submissions from consumer\r\n    groups and wireless providers:\nTelecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2013-271\n.\r\n    The\nWireless Code\n, effective December 2, 2013, established a mandatory\r\n    code of conduct for all providers of retail mobile wireless voice and data\r\n    services. The CRTC noted that prepaid cards are subject to an expiry date\r\n    ranging from 15 days to one year after activation, depending on the value of\r\n    the card, and to continue service and/or carry over credits beyond the expiry\r\n    date consumers can Â“top upÂ” their accounts via the service providerÂ’s website and/or\r\n    by purchasing additional prepaid cards.\n\n[52]\n\nThe\r\n    CRTC received complaints similar to those made by the representative plaintiff\r\n    in this proceeding. Indeed, she herself made a complaint to the CRTC. She and\r\n    other consumers were frustrated that their account balances expired if they did\r\n    not Â“top upÂ” and that they lost the balance in the account if they missed the\r\n    end of their active period, by even one day. They asked the CRTC to require\r\n    wireless service providers to carry over prepaid account balances indefinitely\r\n    or to prohibit the expiry of prepaid cards.\n\n[53]\n\nTo\r\n    address these concerns, the CRTC required wireless service providers to hold\r\n    prepaid card customersÂ’ accounts open for seven days following expiry of an\r\n    activation period to give consumers additional time to Â“top upÂ” their accounts.\r\n    This, it said, would not impose significant burdens on service providers, would\r\n    enhance the clarity of prepaid billing services and policies, would balance\r\n    consumer interests with Â“current market realitiesÂ” and would increase\r\n    flexibility for frequent users of prepaid services.\n\n[54]\n\nThe\r\n    commission concluded, however, that it would not be appropriate to require\r\n    service providers to permit consumers to carry over their prepaid unused\r\n    minutes indefinitely. It noted that prepaid card services provide access to the\r\n    network for a specific period of time. It stated, at para. 349 of its decision:\n\nThe Commission considers that the evidence on the record of the\r\n    proceeding does not support consumersÂ’ request for [wireless service providers]\r\n    to carry over their prepaid unused minutes indefinitely. In this regard, the\r\n    Commission notes that wireless services, including prepaid card services,\r\n    provide access to the network for a specific period of time with specific usage\r\n    limitations that are distinct for each aspect of the service. The Commission considers\r\n    that imposing a requirement that services be provided beyond the limitations\r\n    set out in the service agreement would not be appropriate.\n\n[55]\n\nAs\r\n    the motion judge noted, in November 2013 Bell amended its top-up agreements to\r\n    reflect the seven-day grace period conferred by the CRTCÂ’s decision.\n\n[56]\n\nIt\r\n    is true that this conclusion means that consumers, such as the appellant, may\r\n    find themselves in a situation where their phone cards expire before they have\r\n    had a chance to use all their prepaid credits. They may also find themselves on\r\n    a merry-go-round they cannot get off, because they must constantly top up an\r\n    account with a credit balance, because they have not used up all their credits\r\n    from the previous active period. Depending on oneÂ’s perspective, that may be\r\n    unfair or it may be part of the price paid for the flexibility of a prepaid\r\n    phone card. The CRTC does not address this issue. If the Province of Ontario\r\n    has jurisdiction over phone cards Â– an open question Â– it may choose to do so.\n\n[57]\n\nIn\r\n    my view, the motion judge was correct to grant summary judgment in favour of\r\n    the respondent on the common issue relating to the\nGift Card Regulation.\n\nC.\n\nDisposition\n\n[58]\n\nFor\r\n    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n\n[59]\n\nThe\r\n    parties agreed that costs should be awarded to the successful party in the\r\n    amount of $20,000 all-inclusive, subject to the right of the Class Proceedings\r\n    Fund to make submissions.

Silver, for the appellants\n\nC. David Freedman and Suzana Popovic-Montag, for the\r\n    respondent\n\nHeard: March 29, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the judgment of Justice Kevin W. Whitaker\r\n    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 11, 2015.\n\nWeiler J.A.:\n\nA.\n\nOverview\n\n[1]\n\nThis is a family dispute in which the appellants, Craig and Wendy Glynn,\r\n    seek to set aside a transfer of real property (the Property) to their brother,\r\n    the respondent Grant Glynn. The transfer resulted in Grant becoming a joint\r\n    tenant with his parents, Edward and Wanda Glynn, and was a gift from them.\n\n[2]\n\nCraig and Wendy allege that Edward, with the concurrence of Wanda, promised\r\n    the Property to them. They allege that Edward promised them the Property would\r\n    form part of the corporate assets of Spar Roofing &amp; Metal Supplies Limited,\r\n    a company founded by Edward and now operated by Craig and Wendy in which they\r\n    own all of the common shares. The Property serves as the main roadway access\r\n    and exit to Spar RoofingÂ’s business and is used as a warehouse. It is located\r\n    in Toronto and is worth in excess of two million dollars.\n\n[3]\n\nThe motion judge characterized the appellantsÂ’ pleading as seeking to\r\n    enforce EdwardÂ’s promise to gift the Property to Craig and Wendy in the future\r\n    and struck the appellantsÂ’ claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.\r\n    He further held that the appellants lacked standing to Â“bring a claim to divest\r\n    the defendant of his interests in the property.Â”\n\n[4]\n\nA preliminary issue on this appeal is whether the motion judgeÂ’s reasons\r\n    are so deficient, due to contradictory and conclusory statements, that they are\r\n    incapable of appellate review. If the reasons are sufficient, the issues are\r\n    whether the motion judge erred in striking the appellantsÂ’ claim without leave\r\n    to amend and whether the appellants ought to be granted leave to amend their\r\n    pleading.\n\n[5]\n\nFor the reasons that follow I would hold that the motion judgeÂ’s reasons\r\n    are sufficient because they explain the basis for his conclusion. While he did\r\n    not err in characterizing the claim as being about a promise to make a gift of\r\n    land, I would hold that he erred in dismissing the claim without granting the\r\n    appellants leave to amend their pleading. Accordingly, I would grant the\r\n    appellants leave to amend.\n\nB.\n\nThe Facts Alleged\n\n[6]\n\nThe facts as pleaded are summarized below.\n\n[7]\n\nOn or about August 1994, Edward, as landlord, and Spar Roofing, as\r\n    tenant, entered into a 30-year lease of the Property at the same fixed-rate\r\n    rent for the entire lease period. The lease was signed by Craig on behalf of\r\n    Spar Roofing and registered on title. Edward assured Craig and Wendy that the\r\n    lease was a means of Â‘guaranteeingÂ’ that the Property would form part of the\r\n    company assets. Grant understood that the Property would be included in the\r\n    company assets.\n\n[8]\n\nOn December 19, 2003, Edward and Wanda entered into a letter agreement\r\n    with Craig and Wendy to govern share ownership in Spar Roofing. The agreement\r\n    provided that all of the common shares were owned by Craig and Wendy and that\r\n    upon the deaths of Edward and Wanda, the Class A and Class B shares would also\r\n    be assigned to Craig and Wendy with the result that they would become the sole\r\n    shareholders of the company.\n\n[9]\n\nEdward promised Craig and Wendy on many occasions that his estate would\r\n    be split between his personal assets and the assets related to the company.\r\n    Upon his death the company assets would vest with Craig and Wendy or the\r\n    company. Edward also represented and assured Craig and Wendy that Wanda was in\r\n    agreement with this arrangement.\n\n[10]\n\nEdwardÂ’s mental health began to deteriorate in the early 2000s, when he\r\n    started suffering from dementia/AlzheimerÂ’s and ParkinsonÂ’s disease. He was\r\n    permanently hospitalized for dementia on or about February 22, 2011. Wanda was\r\n    also hospitalized for various physical and mental health issues around the same\r\n    time.\n\n[11]\n\nBoth parents became mentally incompetent and were unable to manage their\r\n    personal and financial affairs.\n[1]\nOn or about February 2011, Grant assumed control over his parentsÂ’ affairs and\r\n    refused to discuss them with Craig or Wendy.\n\nThe\r\n    statement of defence pleads that when Edward and Wanda made their 2009 wills\r\n    leaving the Property to Grant, they also made powers of attorney for property\r\n    and personal care, appointing the other as attorney with Grant as the\r\n    substitute or alternate attorney.\n\n[12]\n\nIn May 2012, Grant arranged for a transfer agreement whereby the\r\n    Property was transferred to him as a joint tenant with Edward and Wanda. He\r\n    arranged for a solicitor to sign the agreement on behalf of his parents and\r\n    register it. The statement of defence pleads that Edward and Wanda personally\r\n    signed a direction and authorization for the lawyer to proceed with the\r\n    transfer.\n\n[13]\n\nThe Property transfer shows the Property being given to Grant as a gift.\n\n[14]\n\nCraig and Wendy did not learn about the transfer until August 2012, when\r\n    they discovered GrantÂ’s name on a tax bill for the Property.\n\n[15]\n\nCraig and Wendy alleged in the statement of claim that in arranging for\r\n    the transfer of the Property to him as a joint tenant, Grant exercised undue\r\n    influence over Edward and Wanda when they were suffering from mental illness\r\n    and that they did not receive independent legal advice prior to entering into the\r\n    transfer. They further alleged that Grant was in a fiduciary relationship with\r\n    Edward and Wanda, and that he received a benefit from the transfer to the\r\n    detriment of Edward, Wanda, Craig and Wendy. Alternatively, or in addition,\r\n    Craig and Wendy alleged that the transfer was void because Edward and Wanda\r\n    lacked mental capacity to enter into the transfer.\n\n[16]\n\nCraig and Wendy also alleged that Grant was aware that Â“it was always\r\n    EdwardÂ’s intention to gift the Company Assets (including the Property) to Craig\r\n    and Wendy or the Company upon his deathÂ” and that GrantÂ’s conduct deprived them\r\n    of an asset to which they are lawfully entitled.\n\n[17]\n\nSince EdwardÂ’s death on February 1, 2014, Grant has rejected every\r\n    request to inform Craig and Wendy of his alleged status as executor of EdwardÂ’s\r\n    estate and attorney over WandaÂ’s property and care.\n\nC.\n\nThe Motion JudgeÂ’s Reasons\n\n[18]\n\nThe core of the motion judgeÂ’s decision is found at paras. 7, 9, 10 and\r\n    11 of his reasons:\n\n[7]Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiffs plead that the property was the subject\r\n    of oral promises made by Edward to Craig and Wendy, and that the property would\r\n    be transferred to them as part of his estate plan. This statement of claim does\r\n    not plead consideration being provided to Edward and/or Wanda, nor terms by\r\n    which it could be said that title to the property was to be transferred [to]\r\n    Spar. The plaintiffs agree that Grant was added to title as a joint tenant by\r\n    Edward and Wanda on the transfer date.\n\n\n\n[9]Â Â Â Â Â  A gift is not a fulfillment of an obligation. A donor\r\n    may simply never make the gift if he or she does not wish to do so even if a\r\n    promise was made. The plaintiffs do not plead any agreement existing between\r\n    the defendant and them. The plaintiffs cannot sue for a third party and lack\r\n    standing to set aside the gift to Grant.\n\n[10]Â Â Â  It is undisputed that the joint tenants prior to the\r\n    transfer were Edward and Wanda. The plaintiffs have no financial interest or\r\n    legal entitlement to the property.\n\n[11]Â Â Â  The oral promise to gift is not enforceable as a matter\r\n    of law. The plaintiffs have no standing to bring a claim to divest the\r\n    defendant of his interests in the property. The plaintiffsÂ’ claims cannot be\r\n    the basis for the relief which the [plaintiffs] seeks.\n\n[19]\n\nThe motion judge observed, at para. 13 of his reasons, that it was\r\n    premature for Grant to rely on the\nStatute of Frauds\n, R.S.O. 1990,\r\n    c.Â S.19, as a basis for striking out the appellantsÂ’ claim, as this was a\r\n    defence that they need not anticipate. The motion judge further noted that\r\n    whether there was sufficient evidence of past conduct as part performance (that\r\n    the appellants wished to put forward by way of reply) to bring the matter\r\n    within an exception to the\nStatute of Frauds\nwas a matter to be\r\n    determined at trial and not at the pleading stage. In so observing, the motion\r\n    judge relied on\nCollins v. Cortez\n,\n\n2014 ONCA 685, 39 C.C.L.I.\r\n    (5th) 1, at para. 10, and\nMountain v. Mountain Estate\n, 2012 ONCA 806,\r\n    112 O.R. (3d) 721. The motion judge also noted that the presumption of WandaÂ’s\r\n    capacity is a matter of defence and that the appellants should not plead the\r\n    manner by which they have proof of her incapacity.\n\n[20]\n\nAt para. 15 of his reasons, however, the motion judge stated:\n\nOn these facts, it cannot be said that it is plain and obvious\r\n    that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. In the\r\n    alternative and in the event that the statement of claim may be deficient, the\r\n    appropriate remedy is the extension of time within which to deliver a reply.\n\n[21]\n\nAt para. 16 of his reasons, the motion judge simply stated that GrantÂ’s\r\n    motion to strike was allowed.\n\nD.\n\nDiscussion and Analysis\n\n(1)\n\nAre the motion judgeÂ’s reasons sufficient to permit appellate review?\n\n[22]\n\nA judgeÂ’s reasons must be read as a whole. An appellate court cannot\r\n    intervene simply because it believes the judge did a poor job of expressing\r\n    himself. A failure to give adequate reasons is not a free standing basis for\r\n    appeal:\nF.H. v. McDougall\n,\n\n2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41,\r\n    at para.Â 99. The duty to give reasons should be given a functional and\r\n    purposeful interpretation. If the reasons explain the basis for the decision\r\n    reached and why the judge arrived at his or her conclusions, they will be\r\n    sufficient:\nD.M. Drugs (Harris Guardian Drugs) v. Barry Edward Bywater\r\n    (Parkview Hotel)\n,\n\n2013 ONCA 356, 307 O.A.C. 71, at paras. 36-37.\n\n[23]\n\nThe appellants submit that the reasons of the motion judge are\r\n    contradictory, confusing and conclusory, fail to provide an explanation for the\r\n    ultimate disposition and fail to provide reasons for denying the appellantsÂ’\r\n    request to file a reply to the effect that the requirements of the\nStatute\r\n    of Frauds\nhave been met.\n\n[24]\n\nI read the reasons of the motion judge as in effect saying the\r\n    following:\n\nÂ·\n\nThe\r\n    claim alleges an oral promise by Edward and Wanda to transfer the Property to\r\n    Spar Roofing and thus to Craig and Wendy, who would ultimately be the sole\r\n    shareholders of Spar Roofing. No consideration is pleaded for this promise. A\r\n    promise to make a gift without more is unenforceable at law. [While the\r\n    pleading alleges that Grant was aware of the promise made by Edward and Wanda\r\n    to the plaintiffs] it does not allege any agreement with Grant.\n\nÂ·\n\nAlthough\r\n    Grant relied on the\nStatute of Frauds\nas a basis for striking the\r\n    statement of claim, this was a defence that the appellants need not have\r\n    anticipated and could have been dealt with by way of reply. The sufficiency of\r\n    past conduct as performance is a matter for trial. Compliance with the\nStatute\r\n    of Frauds\nwas not a basis on which to dismiss the claim at the pleading\r\n    stage. It was thus unnecessary to grant the plaintiffs request for an\r\n    adjournment to file a reply.\n\nÂ·\n\nIt\r\n    could not be said that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of\r\n    action [given the allegations of mental incapacity on the part of Edward and\r\n    Wanda to make the transfer and the allegations of undue influence and breach of\r\n    fiduciary duty against Grant]. The appropriate remedy for a deficiency in\r\n    pleading was an extension of time.\n\nÂ·\n\n[EdwardÂ’s\r\n    estate trustee and Wanda do not attack the transfer.] The plaintiffs cannot sue\r\n    Grant for the benefit of/on behalf of a third party. The plaintiffs have no\r\n    financial interest or legal entitlement to the Property. Thus, the plaintiffs\r\n    lack standing to attack the transfer of the Property to Grant.\n\nÂ·\n\nGrantÂ’s\r\n    motion to strike should be allowed.\n\n[25]\n\nWhile the reasons are not easy to understand, reading them as a whole\r\n    and giving them a functional and purposeful interpretation, they explain the\r\n    basis for the motion judgeÂ’s decision to strike the pleading, why he refused to\r\n    grant an adjournment to file a reply and how he arrived at his conclusion.\n\n[26]\n\nThis ground of appeal is dismissed.\n\n(2)\n\nDid the motion judge err in characterizing the claim as a being about a\r\n    promise to gift the Property?\n\n[27]\n\nThe appellantsÂ’ primary position is that the motion judge erred in\r\n    characterizing EdwardÂ’s promise as a gift. They submit that the motion judgeÂ’s\r\n    characterization of the pleading as being about a gift is a false premise upon\r\n    which he based his decision. They submit that what was pleaded was an agreement\r\n    to convey property and the motion judge therefore erred. They submit that the\r\n    long-term lease with no provision for rent increase is part performance of the\r\n    agreement, and that the omission to specifically plead part performance of the\r\n    agreement or to plead consideration could have been corrected by an amendment\r\n    to the pleading.\n\n[28]\n\nThe appellants further argue that, pursuant to the agreement to convey\r\n    the Property, they had an equitable interest in the Property and standing to\r\n    challenge the transfer to Grant. The motion judgeÂ’s conclusion, at para. 10 of\r\n    his reasons, that, Â“The plaintiffs have no financial interest or legal\r\n    entitlement to the propertyÂ” is based therefore on the incorrect conclusion\r\n    that what was pled was a gift, and if there was an agreement to transfer the Property,\r\n    the motion judgeÂ’s holding that the pleading seeks to enforce a promise to make\r\n    a gift is not available. The appellants submit that the pleading alleges an\r\n    agreement that Grant took steps to frustrate through the exercise of undue\r\n    influence over his parents, or in breach of his fiduciary duty when he was\r\n    controlling his parentsÂ’ affairs, and that the court should give effect to the\r\n    pleading that Wanda lacks capacity.\n\n[29]\n\nThe appellantsÂ’ forceful argument ignores, however, para. 25 of the\r\n    pleading which states: Â“As Grant was aware, it was always EdwardÂ’s intention to\ngift\nthe Company Assets (including the Property)\r\n    to Craig and Wendy or the Company upon his deathÂ” (emphasis added).\n\n[30]\n\nThe pleading as a whole is consistent with the characterization of the\r\n    arrangement as a promised gift rather than as an agreement to convey. The\r\n    letter agreement pleaded in para. 10 does not deal with the Property; it deals\r\n    only with share ownership in Spar Roofing. Paragraph 11 pleads that Edward\r\n    promised Craig and Wendy that his estate would be split between his personal assets\r\n    and the assets related to the company with the company assets vesting in Craig\r\n    and Wendy or the company and that Wanda agreed with this arrangement. Paragraph\r\n    13 pleads that the Property would form part of the company assets. Paragraph 14\r\n    pleads the existence of the lease agreement. While it is submitted that\r\n    pleading the lease agreement is pleading part performance of a contract, the\r\n    pleading is equally consistent with the favorable terms of the lease agreement\r\n    being a gift.\n\n[31]\n\nThe pleading does not allege an agreement to convey the Property in\r\n    exchange for services performed or money spent; it does not allege any acts\r\n    done in reliance on a promise to convey. Overall, the pleading does not allege\r\n    that Edward and Wanda breached any alleged agreement and Wanda has not been\r\n    sued. Inasmuch as no agreement is pleaded, the pleading does not specifically\r\n    allege that Grant induced the breach of this agreement.\n\n[32]\n\nThe relief sought in the statement of claim is simply that the transfer\r\n    be set aside and an injunction issued against Grant as well as permission to\r\n    file a statement of pending litigation. A declaration of entitlement to the Property\r\n    is not sought as part of the relief requested by the appellants.\n\n[33]\n\nThe motion judge was of the opinion that the issue of the\nStatute of\r\n    Frauds\nwas a matter to be dealt with at trial. At the same time, he\r\n    dismissed the claim. It does not appear that he considered whether an\r\n    adjournment to permit a reply might affect his decision on the claimÂ’s\r\n    viability. What exactly was argued in support of the request for an adjournment\r\n    to file a reply is unclear.\n\n[34]\n\nThe motion judge did not err in his characterization of the appellantsÂ’\r\n    claim as a promise to make a gift. On the basis of the material before him, it\r\n    appeared to be obvious that the appellants lacked standing to have Grant\r\n    account for the transfer of an interest in the Property to him.\n\n(3)\n\nDid the motion judge err in not granting leave to amend?\n\n[35]\n\nRule 26.01 of the\nRules of Civil Procedure\n, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.\r\n    194, provides that Â“at any stage of an action the court shall grant leave to\r\n    amend a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that\r\n    could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.Â” The words Â“at any\r\n    stageÂ” include the appeal: see e.g.\nConway v. Law Society of Upper Canada\n,\r\n    2016 ONCA 72.\n\n[36]\n\nThe rule is designed to carry out the underlying principles reflected in\r\n    the\nCourts of Justice Act\n, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, of encouraging public\r\n    access to the courts (s. 71) and affirming the role of the Superior Court as a court\r\n    of equity (s.Â 96) where actions are decided on their merits. Another\r\n    purpose is to bring all parties to disputes relating to one subject matter\r\n    before the court at the same time so that disputes might be determined without\r\n    the delay, inconvenience and expense of separate actions. The object of the\r\n    rule requiring the court to grant leave to amend is not that the partyÂ’s case\r\n    should be so framed as to succeed but that it be framed so that it can be\r\n    adjudicated by the court, whether for or against the party.\n\n[37]\n\nAs far back as 1883, Lord Brett M.R. laid down this rule regarding the\r\n    amendment of pleadings in\nClarapede v. Commercial Union Assn.\n(1883),\r\n    32 W.R. 262; it was restated by Lord Esher M.R. in\nSteward v. North\r\n    Metropolitan Tramways Co.\n(1886), 16 Q.B.D. 556, 55 L.J.Q.B. 157 (C.A.),\r\n    as follows:\n\nThe rule of conduct of the Court in such a case is that,\r\n    however negligent or careless may have been the first omission, and however\r\n    late the proposed amendment, the amendment should be allowed, if it can be made\r\n    without injustice to the other side. There is no injustice if the other side\r\n    can be compensated by costs: but, if the amendment will put them into such a\r\n    position that they must be injured, it ought not to be made.\n\nThis rule was adopted in Ontario in\nWilliams v.\r\n    Leonard\n(1895), 16 P.R. 544, at p.Â 549 (Ont. H.C.), affÂ’d (1896), 17\r\n    P.R. 73 (Ont. C.A.), affÂ’d (1896), 26 S.C.R. 406. This court has recently\r\n    affirmed the principle that amendments should be allowed absent non-compensable\r\n    prejudice and noted additional factors to guide the application of r. 26.01:\r\n    see\nMarks v. Ottawa\n, 2011 ONCA 248, 280 O.A.C. 251, at para. 19;\n1317424\r\n    Ontario Inc. v. Chrysler Canada Inc.\n, 2015 ONCA 104, 330 O.A.C. 195, at\r\n    para. 7.\n\n[38]\n\nAlthough the appellants did not make a specific request to amend the\r\n    claim, their request for an adjournment of the motion to file a reply was in\r\n    effect a request to amend. As indicated, the motion judge was of the opinion\r\n    that an adjournment to file a reply respecting the\nStatute of Frauds\nwas unnecessary. However, when he dismissed the entire claim, r.Â 26.01\r\n    required the motion judge to consider whether leave to amend should be granted\r\n    and, if he determined that it should not, to provide reasons responsive to the\r\n    grounds for refusing leave identified in the jurisprudence, unless his reasons\r\n    for not granting leave were obvious or could be inferred.\n\n[39]\n\nNo draft amended statement of claim has been proffered on appeal in\r\n    support of the request for leave to amend. Based on the oral argument on appeal,\r\n    the proposed amendment would allege an agreement wherein Edward, with WandaÂ’s\r\n    concurrence, promised to convey the Property to Craig and Wendy or to Spar in\r\n    exchange for the performance of services and money expended on the Property.\r\n    The agreement was to be fulfilled upon EdwardÂ’s death or at the latest when\r\n    Wanda died. The theory of the case would be that Edward and Wanda were not able\r\n    to convey an interest in the Property to Grant as a joint tenant because at the\r\n    time of the transfer the appellants already had an equitable interest in the Property.\r\n    In addition to requesting that the transfer be set aside, the prayer for relief\r\n    would need to be amended to request a declaration that the appellants held an\r\n    equitable interest in the Property at the time of the transfer to Grant. The\r\n    pleading would also allege that Grant prevented the agreement from being\r\n    fulfilled by having an interest in the Property transferred to himself as joint\r\n    tenant.\n\n[40]\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to plead an additional legal theory which\r\n    flows partly from the facts already pleaded and partly from additional facts\r\n    that the appellants wish to plead. The purpose of the amended claim would be to\r\n    obviate the question of standing at the pleading stage and to avoid a later\r\n    argument that the legal theories and consequences flowing from the facts as\r\n    proven were not pleaded.\n\n[41]\n\nThe respondent submits that an oral promise to gift land is simply\r\n    unenforceable as a matter of established law and, as a result, the motion judge\r\n    did not err in striking the claim. He further submits that, as pleaded, the\r\n    motion judge did not err in holding that the appellants lack standing to bring\r\n    their action. I acknowledge the strength of these submissions but they do not\r\n    answer the question of whether leave to amend should now be granted.\n\n[42]\n\nOn the issue of whether leave to amend should be granted, the respondent\r\n    renews his argument that the appellantsÂ’ proposed amendment is unenforceable\r\n    because they cannot bring themselves within the exception to the\nStatute of\r\n    Frauds\n. The respondent further submits that the appellants have\r\n    misapprehended the equitable doctrine of part performance of an agreement in\r\n    relation to land that would otherwise be unenforceable because it is not in\r\n    writing. He submits that the appellants must plead acts done in reliance of\r\n    such magnitude that it would be inequitable and unconscionable to deny them\r\n    relief. He points out that the law requires that the acts put forward as part\r\n    performance refer to the alleged contract dealing with the land, and refers to\nSteinberg\r\n    v. King\n,\n\n2011 ONSC 3042, and\nCowderoy v. Sorkos Estate\n,\n\n2012 ONSC 1921, 23 R.P.R. (5th) 36, in support of this argument.\n\n[43]\n\nThe respondentÂ’s submission is in effect a submission that the court\r\n    should consider the merits of the factual and legal basis for the proposed\r\n    amendment at the pleading stage and not at a later stage of the proceedings.\r\n    That is not the law under r. 26.01. As stated in Todd Archibald, Gordon Killeen\r\n    &amp; James C. Morton,\nOntario Superior Court Practice, 2016 Edition\n(Markham, ON: LexisNexis Canada, 2015), at p. 1151:\n\nThe amended pleading must be legally tenable. It is not\r\n    necessary to tender evidence to support the claims nor is it necessary for the\r\n    court to consider whether the amending party is able to prove its amended claim.\r\n    The court must assume that the facts pleaded in the proposed amendment (unless\r\n    patently ridiculous or incapable of proof) are true, and the only question is\r\n    whether they disclose a cause of action. Amendments are to be granted unless\r\n    the claim is clearly impossible of success.\n\nPut another way, an amendment is to be granted unless\r\n    it would have been struck out under r. 21.01(1)(b) if it had been pleaded\r\n    originally:\n1317424 Ontario Inc.\n, at para. 7. A motion to strike out a\r\n    pleading on the ground it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence\r\n    must not, however, be conflated with a motion for summary judgment under r.\r\n    20.04: see\nAndersen Consulting v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(2001),\r\n    150 O.A.C. 177 (C.A.), at paras. 34-37;\nGriffiths v. Canaccord Capital\r\n    Corp.\n(2005), 204 O.A.C. 224 (Div. Ct.), at para. 10.\n\n[44]\n\nThe proposed amendment to the pleading discloses a cause of action. That\r\n    question is whether an alleged oral agreement made between the appellants and\r\n    Edward and Wanda should be enforced against Grant notwithstanding the\r\n    requirements of the\nStatute of Frauds\nand notwithstanding the lack of\r\n    privity of contract between the appellants and him. While difficult to prove,\r\n    it cannot be said that the proposed amendment is incapable of proof.\n\n[45]\n\nIn my view, given that the respondent does not allege prejudice that\r\n    cannot be compensated for in costs, the appellants must be given leave to amend\r\n    their pleading.\n\n(4)\n\nDo the plaintiffs have standing to question the transfer of the Property\r\n    to Grant on the basis of alleged undue influence and breach of fiduciary duty?\n\n[46]\n\nAn alternative ground of appeal is whether, apart from any alleged\r\n    agreement to convey, the appellants have standing to seek to set aside the\r\n    transfer to Grant. The pleading alleges that Grant took advantage of Edward and\r\n    Wanda when they were suffering from mental illness. The appellants further\r\n    plead, in para. 23 of their claim, that they are entitled to have the transfer\r\n    set aside because of undue influence by Grant on Edward and Wanda; that Grant\r\n    was in a fiduciary relationship with Edward and Wanda as the manager of their\r\n    financial affairs; and, that Grant received a benefit from the Property\r\n    transfer that was to the detriment of Edward, Wanda, Craig and Wendy and in\r\n    breach of GrantÂ’s fiduciary duty to Edward and Wanda.\n\n[47]\n\nIn addition, the appellants plead that Grant assumed control over his\r\n    parentsÂ’ affairs and that since EdwardÂ’s passing on February 1, 2014, Grant has\r\n    rejected every request to inform his siblings respecting his alleged status as\r\n    executor of EdwardÂ’s estate and attorney over WandaÂ’s property and care. Thus,\r\n    the pleading alleges that in respect of Edward, the attorney (while Edward was\r\n    alive) and estate trustee (now that Edward is deceased) are one and the same\r\n    person, namely Grant. I read the claim as requiring Grant to account for his\r\n    actions respecting the Property and to justify his actions as being beneficial\r\n    to the donees of the power of attorney, failing which, the transfer should be\r\n    set aside. The appellants also allege that Edward and Wanda lacked the mental\r\n    capacity to manage their affairs at the time they gave a direction to the\r\n    lawyer who carried out the transfer.\n\n[48]\n\nThe motion judge recognized this pleading constituted a valid cause of\r\n    action, but because he was of the view that the appellants lacked any financial\r\n    or other interest in the Property, he held they had no standing to challenge\r\n    the transfer to Grant as a joint tenant. The appellants submit that on the\r\n    basis of the allegations made in their claim they do have standing to impugn\r\n    GrantÂ’s actions. They ask: Â“If the Appellants do not have standing in that\r\n    regard, who does?Â” They do not, however, answer the question.\n\n[49]\n\nAs I would grant the appellants leave to amend their pleading so that\r\n    the action can proceed based on the alleged existence of an oral agreement\r\n    concerning the Property, it is unnecessary to decide this issue. I would,\r\n    however, make the following observations.\n\n[50]\n\nAt common law, a general power of attorney terminated upon the grantorÂ’s\r\n    subsequent mental incapacity or death, and only the grantor or the grantorÂ’s\r\n    estate had standing to call the donee to account for his actions as attorney:\r\n    see\nAxler v. Axler\n(1993), 50 E.T.R. 93 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at p. 99,\nper\nBorins J.;\nLeung Estate v. Leung\n(2001), 38 E.T.R. (2d) 226 (Ont.\r\n    S.C.), at p. 229.\n\n[51]\n\nThe common law relating to powers of attorney has, however, been\r\n    supplanted in Ontario by statute. Powers of attorney are now governed by the\nPowers\r\n    of Attorney Act\n, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.20, and the\nSubstitute Decisions\r\n    Act, 1992\n, S.O. 1992, c. 30. The\nSDA\nis a comprehensive statute\r\n    which governs, among other things, all aspects of continuing powers of attorney\r\n    for property and powers of attorney for personal care.\nSection 42(1) of the\nSDA\nprovides: Â“The court may, on application, order that all or a specified part of\r\n    the accounts of an attorney or guardian of property be passed.Â” The persons who\r\n    may bring an application for a passing of accounts are listed in s. 42(3) and\r\n    (4), and include: Â“Any other person, with leave of the court.Â”\n\n[52]\n\nA line of jurisprudence in Ontario interpreting the\nSDA\nhas\r\n    held that, following the grantorÂ’s death and where the attorney and estate\r\n    trustee are one and the same person, there can be no true accounting as between\r\n    the attorney and estate trustee. As a result, courts have permitted\r\n    beneficiaries and others in this circumstance to seek leave, as Â“any other\r\n    personÂ” under s. 42(4), to apply to the court for a passing of the attorneyÂ’s\r\n    accounts for the period the attorney acted prior to the grantorÂ’s death: see\nDe\r\n    Zorzi Estate v. Read\n(2008), 38 E.T.R. (3d) 318 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 11-13;\nMcAllister Estate v. Hudgin\n(2008), 42 E.T.R. (3d) 313 (Ont. S.C.), at\r\n    para. 9;\nCarfagnini v.

I raise it only to indicate that the\r\n    law in this area is evolving and to point out that the\nSDA\nprovides a\r\n    mechanism for a third party to compel an attorney to account. My comments\r\n    should not be taken as suggesting that any application by the appellants under\r\n    the\nSDA\nwould ultimately be successful.\n\nE.\n\nDisposition and Costs\n\n[54]\n\nI would allow the appeal and grant leave to amend the claim, and would\r\n    permit the appellant to serve and file within 60 days of the date of the\r\n    release of these reasons an amended statement of claim that pleads the existence\r\n    of an oral agreement concerning the Property with proper particulars. I would\r\n    permit the respondent to serve and file an amended statement of defence to that\r\n    claim in accordance with the timelines set out in r. 18.01.\n\n[55]\n\nI would set aside the costs awarded at first instance to the respondent\r\n    on the motion and instead would order that there be no costs of the motion. The\r\n    appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal which, as agreed, are\r\n    fixed at $15,000 inclusive of all applicable taxes and disbursements.\n\nReleased: Â“KMWÂ” April 25, 2016\n\nÂ“Karen M.

Longo and Patrick Copeland, for the respondent\n\nHeard: April 11, 2016\n\nOn appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas R. Lederer of\r\n    the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 20, 2015.\n\nBy the Court:\n\nI. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Introduction\n\n[1]\n\nThe appellant, Toronto Muslim Cemetery Corporation (Â“TMCCÂ”), appeals\r\n    from the summary judgment granted by the application judge: i) declaring that\r\n    the document signed by the parties on May 13, 2014 (the Â“May AgreementÂ”) is\r\n    Â“the Â‘formal agreementÂ’ referred to in the Memorandum of UnderstandingÂ” signed\r\n    by the partiesÂ’ representatives on April 13, 2014 and that it is Â“a contract\r\n    that binds the partiesÂ”; and ii) directing that the May Agreement be rectified\r\n    by the removal therefrom of clause 7(7), which read: Â“within 4 weeks, a formal\r\n    agreement shall be made between the partiesÂ” (the Â“Formal Agreement ClauseÂ”).\n\n[2]\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument on behalf of TMCC, the court\r\n    dismissed the appeal for reasons to follow.Â  These are those reasons.\n\nII.Â  Â Â Â Â  Issues\n\n[3]\n\nAlthough the appellant advanced numerous grounds of appeal in its\r\n    factum, at the appeal hearing those grounds were narrowed to three:\n\n(1)\n\nDid the\r\n    application judge err by granting rectification of the May Agreement based on\r\n    mutual mistake regarding the inclusion of the Formal Agreement Clause?\n\n(2)\n\nDid the\r\n    application judge err by holding that the May Agreement constitutes a final and\r\n    binding contract between the parties?\n\n(3)\n\nDid the\r\n    respondent, Muslim Green Cemeteries Corporation (Â“MGCCÂ”) breach the May Agreement?\n\nIII.Â  Â Â Â  Discussion\n\n[4]\n\nThe focus of TMCCÂ’s oral submissions was the claim that the application\r\n    judge erred by applying the wrong test for rectification of the May Agreement,\r\n    namely, rectification based on mutual, rather than unilateral, mistake.\n\n[5]\n\nWith respect, this puts the cart before the horse.Â  No issue of\r\n    rectification arises, on any basis, unless it is first determined that the\r\n    application judgeÂ’s central finding Â– that the May Agreement constitutes a\r\n    binding contract Â– is sustainable.\n\n[6]\n\nWe have no difficulty in concluding that this core finding is amply\r\n    supported by the evidentiary record.Â  As the application judge put it, at para.\r\n    23:\n\nIn summary, the payment and acceptance of the deposit, the due\r\n    diligence along with the identification and retaining of consultants, the\r\n    advertising by the applicant in company with the request for its membership\r\n    list and the making of the planning application paid for by the applicant and\r\n    signed on behalf of the respondent establish that\nthe parties were acting\r\n    under, and in compliance with, the agreement signed on May 13, 2014.Â  They both\r\n    acted as if it was the formal and final agreement between them\n.Â  [Emphasis\r\n    added.]\n\n[7]\n\nOn the evidence before the application judge, these conclusions are\r\n    unassailable.Â  The conduct of the parties, both at the time of formation of the\r\n    May Agreement and in its immediate aftermath, was consistent with the intended\r\n    finality and binding nature of the May Agreement.\n\n[8]\n\nThe appellant contends that the application judge erred in concluding\r\n    that the May Agreement was final and binding because the partiesÂ’\r\n    communications and dealings prior to its execution established that the involvement\r\n    of lawyers to negotiate and prepare a formal agreement was a condition\r\n    precedent to any final and binding contract.\n\n[9]\n\nWe disagree.\n\n[10]\n\nThe\r\n    application judge considered and rejected this argument.Â  While an early draft\r\n    memorandum of understanding between the parties contemplated solicitor\r\n    involvement in concluding a formal agreement, no such requirement anywhere\r\n    appears in the May Agreement.Â  As the application judge said, at para. 26:\n\nThe difficulty is that, while the parties upon the signing of\r\n    the agreement acted in response to their obligations under it, there is nothing\r\n    they did that would serve to confirm the understanding that there was no\r\n    agreement and would not be until lawyers became involved.Â  To my mind, the\r\n    removal of the reference to lawyers in the April 13, 2014 version and continued\r\n    in the May [Agreement] suggests that changes had been made and that lawyers\r\n    were no longer needed to finalize the agreement.\n\n[11]\n\nThe\r\n    application judge reviewed in detail four categories of evidence relied on by\r\n    TMCC as supporting its claim that the parties intended that lawyers would\r\n    prepare a formal agreement evidencing their bargain and that no binding\r\n    agreement would exist until this had occurred.Â  The application judge concluded\r\n    that none of this evidence established this claim.Â  For example, he held:\n\n(1)\n\nThere is\r\n    nothing in what was said that demonstrates any agreement that lawyers were\r\n    required, as part of the arrangement between the parties, to approve or review\r\n    the agreement before it would become binding on them (at para. 33);\n\n(2)\n\nEither\r\n    party could review the agreement with lawyers, but it was their individual\r\n    decision whether or not to do so.Â  There was no legal obligation that this had\r\n    to be done before the contract could be considered final (at para. 38); and\n\n(3)\n\nActions do\r\n    speak louder than words. The statements relied on by [TMCC], particularly when\r\n    used out of context and without concern for the circumstances in which they\r\n    were made, cannot set aside the actions of the parties taken in response to the\r\n    execution of the [May Agreement] (at para. 45).\n\n[12]\n\nWe\r\n    agree with the application judgeÂ’s conclusion on this issue and with his\r\n    reasoning in support of it.Â  At the end of the day, he held that the language\r\n    of the May Agreement and the partiesÂ’ own conduct at the time of and following\r\n    the time of its execution belied the assertion that, by May 2014, solicitor\r\n    involvement remained a condition precedent to the creation of a binding\r\n    agreement between the parties.Â  This holding is firmly anchored in the\r\n    evidence.Â  We see no basis for appellate interference with it.\n\n[13]\n\nWe\r\n    come then, to TMCCÂ’s argument that the application judge erred by applying the\r\n    wrong test for rectification.Â  This argument arises from the inclusion of the\r\n    Formal Agreement Clause in the May Agreement.Â  On its face, this provision is\r\n    inconsistent with the notion that the parties intended the May Agreement to\r\n    constitute a final and binding contract.\n\n[14]\n\nHowever,\r\n    the application judge reviewed the various draft memoranda of understanding\r\n    between the parties and the documents entered into by them prior to execution\r\n    of the May Agreement.Â  He found, on the whole of the evidence, that the Formal\r\n    Agreement Clause had been carried forward into the May Agreement from an\r\n    earlier document by mutual mistake.Â  This finding was open to the application\r\n    judge.Â  It accords with the development over time of the documents evidencing\r\n    the partiesÂ’ evolving agreement.Â  It also accords with the other terms of the\r\n    May Agreement, as acted on by the parties.\n\n[15]\n\nIn\r\n    these circumstances, the authorities relating to unilateral mistake relied on\r\n    by TMCC are irrelevant.Â  On the application judgeÂ’s findings, the relevant test\r\n    for rectification was that applicable to mutual mistake.Â  We see no error in\r\n    his rectification order.Â  This ground of appeal therefore fails.\n\n[16]\n\nThe\r\n    final ground advanced by TMCC concerns MGCCÂ’s alleged breach of the May Agreement.Â \r\n    As TMCC concedes, this argument formed no part of its case or argument before\r\n    the application judge.Â  Instead, TMCC raises it for the first time on appeal.Â \r\n    As a result, the evidentiary record on this issue is incomplete, at best.Â \r\n    Further, this court does not have the benefit of any findings by the\r\n    application judge on the issue, and MGCC has had no opportunity to respond to\r\n    the breach claim or to lead evidence to address it.\n\n[17]\n\nIn\r\n    these circumstances, it is not open to TMCC to advance this argument on\r\n    appeal.Â  We note, in any event, that it is wholly inconsistent with TMCCÂ’s\r\n    primary assertion that the May Agreement is neither final nor binding.\n\nIV.Â  Â Â  Disposition\n\n[18]\n\nThe application judge reviewed the contested issues in this case and the\r\n    entirety of the relevant evidence in detail.Â  He provided clear and cogent\r\n    reasons for his finding that the May Agreement constitutes a binding contract\r\n    between the parties.Â  That finding is sustainable on this record.Â  TMCC,\r\n    therefore, must live by the bargain it made.\n\n[19]\n\nAccordingly,\r\n    the appeal is dismissed.Â  MGCC is entitled to its costs of the appeal, fixed in\r\n    the total amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable\r\n    taxes.\n\nReleased:\n\nÂ“APR 18 2016Â”Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â“E.A.\r\n    Cronk

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: R. v. Alvarez, 2016 ONCA 259

DATE: 20160408

DOCKET: C59746

MacPherson, MacFarland and LaForme JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Her Majesty the Queen

Respondent

and

Keron Alvarez

Appellant

Jonathan Dawe, for the
    appellant

Karen Papadopoulos, for the respondent

Heard: April 5, 2016

On appeal from the conviction entered on November 29,
    2013 by Justice Ian A. MacDonnell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    without a jury.

ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The trial judge convicted the appellant of 11 counts stemming from the
    abduction of the complainant, namely: (i) uttering a threat (x2); (ii) assault
    with a handgun; (iii) pointing a firearm (x2); (iv) forcible confinement; (v)
    attempted murder; (vi) assault; and (vii) possession of a firearm contrary to a
    prohibition order (x3). He was sentenced to a global term of imprisonment of 10
    years less pre-trial custody.

[2]

After considering the complainantÂ’s evidence, together with all the
    other evidence tendered by the Crown, the trial judge found the appellant and
    his accomplice abducted the complainant at gunpoint as she walked home with her
    boyfriend. He accepted that the complainant was dragged through alleyways and
    held hostage in a nearby townhouse; that the appellant tried to shoot her but
    his gun did not go off; and that the appellant and his accomplice beat her up.

[3]

Further, the trial judge accepted that the appellant did all this to try
    and start a fight with the complainantÂ’s boyfriend. And in fact, the appellant
    did exchange gunfire with the boyfriend.

[4]

The central issue at trial was identity. The appellant did not testify
    and no defence evidence was called.

[5]

On the appeal of his convictions, the appellant submits the trial judge
    erred in two ways. First, he claims the trial judge failed to consider the
    possibility that because the complainant had been exposed to an image of the
    appellant, her identification evidence was contaminated. Second, he asserts
    that the trial judge convicted the appellant of attempted murder by ignoring
    potentially exculpatory evidence and/or exculpatory interpretations of the
    evidence.

[6]

The impact of the evidence of the complainant having viewed a You Tube video
    of the appellant some five months after the abduction and prior to her viewing
    his photo in the lineup was an issue for the trial judge to decide based on the
    facts. When his reasons are read as a whole, it is clear he was alive to the
    potential contamination from the You Tube video. It is equally clear that he
    relied on other independent evidence to satisfy himself that the video did not
    contaminate her identification evidence.

[7]

The appellantÂ’s assertion that the trial judge may not have appreciated
    the true nature of the problem is not supported by the record. In our view, and
    consistent with the trial judgeÂ’s findings, any potential concerns raised by
    the video are satisfied by the amount and quality of the one on one time the
    complainant spent with the appellant.

[8]

This case was not an identification case involving a fleeting glimpse of
    a complete stranger. Here, the complainant had met the appellant for the first
    time in her building a few months prior to the abduction, when he offered to
    help her with her groceries. In addition, the night before her abduction, the
    complainant witnessed Â“a brief but heatedÂ” argument between her boyfriend and
    the appellant while in a Pizza Pizza restaurant.

[9]

Furthermore, during the events that gave rise to the criminal acts, the
    complainant had on numerous occasions observed the appellant close up and even engaged
    him in conversation. And, as she testified, she walked outside with the
    appellant and remained beside him in the alleyway before, during and after the
    gunfight.

[10]

Finally,
    we note that the appellantÂ’s trial counsel did not raise the issue in his
    closing submissions. This ground of appeal is dismissed.

[11]

We
    also reject the appellantÂ’s assertions that the trial judge misapprehended
    evidence or failed to provide adequate reasons for convicting him of attempting
    to murder the complainant.

[12]

First,
    the trial judge specifically adverted to evidence of the other witness who said
    he saw only one man. He found the difference between this evidence and that of
    the complainant as being Â“no more than what one would expect given the
    circumstances in which the observations of all of the witnesses, including [the
    complainant], were made.Â” He was wholly entitled to reach this conclusion.

[13]

Second,
    the trial judge did not convict the appellant of attempt murder based only on
    the complainantÂ’s subjective belief. Rather, he convicted him on an objective
    assessment of all the evidence pointing to attempted murder, which included the
    complainantÂ’s observations. He assessed her testimony on this issue together
    with other facts he found that surrounded her account. The trial judge
    concluded that the only reasonable inference is that the appellant Â“pointed the
    gun at her head and pulled the trigger.Â”

[14]

Furthermore,
    it is beyond dispute that the appellantÂ’s weapon was an operable firearm since
    he had fired it moments earlier at her boyfriend. Thus, it was entirely open to
    the trial judge to then find that when the appellant Â“pointed the gun at [the
    appellantÂ’s] head and pulled the triggerÂ”, he expected to shoot her.

[15]

We
    find no error in either trial judgeÂ’s approach or his conclusions. We would
    once again point out that trial judges are in the best position to make the
    necessary findings of fact and are entitled to great deference. In doing so in
    this case, the trial judge did not misapprehend evidence as argued by the
    appellant and his reasons for his decision are more than adequate. The
    conviction for attempt murder was reasonable.

[16]

For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION:Â  R. v. Chapman, 2016 ONCA 310

DATE: 20160428

DOCKET: C60515

Cronk, Tulloch and van Rensburg JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Her Majesty the Queen

Appellant

and

Michael Chapman

Respondent

Christine Bartlett-Hughes and Hannah Freeman, for the
    appellant

Brian H. Greenspan and Naomi M. Lutes, for the respondent

Heard: January 7, 2016

On appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice A.J.
    Goodman of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated April
    30, 2015.

Cronk J.A.:

[1]

Following a trial by judge alone, the respondent was acquitted of six sexual
    offences involving two underage girls: two counts of sexual assault, two counts
    of sexual interference, one count of invitation to sexual touching and one
    count of obtaining for consideration the sexual services of a person under the
    age of 18 years, all contrary to the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46
    (the Â“
Code
Â”).

[2]

The Crown appeals against the acquittals, except the acquittal on the
    procuring offence. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.

I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Background

[3]

The charges against the respondent arose out of incidents that occurred
    on December 2, 2013, when the respondent, then 40 years of age, picked up two teenage
    girls who were hitchhiking in Kitchener, Ontario. The girls were 14 and
    one-half years old (V.T.) and 15 and one-half years old (A.S.) at the time.

[4]

While travelling in the respondentÂ’s vehicle, the complainants made
    unsolicited, sexually suggestive comments and engaged in conversation with the
    respondent about sex, partying, drinking and smoking. They claimed that they
    had just attended a college party but had missed their ride home. They also
    said that they were finished high school and, according to the respondent,
    mentioned that they wanted to go somewhere warm and have Â“funÂ”.

[5]

The respondent drove with the complainants to his parentsÂ’ home in
    Kitchener.Â  After the consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, the
    trio ended up in a hot tub in the backyard. While in the hot tub, A.S. and the
    respondent engaged in fellatio and sexual intercourse. A short time later, the
    respondent had sexual intercourse with V.T. in one of the bedrooms at the
    house.

[6]

The respondent then drove the girls to Cambridge. At their request, he
    stopped to buy them cigarettes and then dropped them off at a local restaurant.
    He also gave them $10 to buy something to eat.

[7]

At trial, the
actus reus
of the offences charged was conceded.
    There was no dispute that the parties had engaged in the sexual acts alleged
    and that the complainants had participated willingly.Â  However, since both girls
    were under the age of 16 years, as a matter of law, they could not consent to
    the sexual acts. The primary issue at trial, therefore, was whether the
    respondent could avail himself of the mistake of age defence as set out in s.
    150.1(4) of the
Code
.Â  That section reads:

It is not a defence to a charge under section 151 or 152,
    subsection 160(3) or 173(2), or section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused
    believed that the complainant was 16 years of age or more at the time the
    offence is alleged to have been committed
unless the accused took all
    reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the complainant
. [Emphasis
    added.]

[8]

In essence, s. 150.1(4) allows a defence to certain types of sexual
    activity with a complainant under the age of 16 years based on a mistake of
    fact as to the complainantÂ’s age where the accused has taken all reasonable
    steps to ascertain age. As the respondent was charged with offences under ss.
    151, 152 and 271 of the
Code
, he could only satisfy s. 150.1(4) if, on
    the trial judgeÂ’s findings, he honestly believed that the complainants were 16
    years of age or more and his belief was honestly held because he had taken Â“all
    reasonable stepsÂ” to ascertain their ages.

[9]

The respondent testified.Â  He said that he honestly and mistakenly
    believed the complainants had finished high school and were each 17 or 18 years
    old. He maintained that, based on their appearance, actions and demeanour, and
    the information they provided to him, he had taken all reasonable steps to
    ascertain their ages.

[10]

The trial judge found that A.S. was not a credible witness and that her
    memory of certain events was unreliable. He also found that there were internal
    and external inconsistencies in both her evidence and that of V.T. While he did
    not accept the entirety of the respondentÂ’s testimony, he concluded that it
    raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the respondent had taken all reasonable
    steps in the circumstances to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages.

[11]

More particularly, the trial judge held that, based on the complainantsÂ’
    demonstrated actions, demeanour, self-professed stated objectives and portrayal
    of themselves as older than their true ages on the night in question, along
    with the total Â“constellation of factorsÂ”, the respondent was not required to make
    further inquiries. He therefore concluded that the Crown had failed to meet its
    burden to prove, to the requisite criminal standard, that the respondent did
    not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. Accordingly,
    he acquitted the respondent of all charges.

II.Â  Â Â Â Â  Issues

[12]

There are two issues on appeal:

(1)

Has
    the Crown raised a question of law alone, entitling it to appeal from the
    acquittals in question under s. 676(1)(a) of the
Code
?

(2)

Did
    the trial judge err in his consideration of the mistake of age defence under s.
    150.1(4) of the
Cod
e?

III.Â  Â Â Â Â  PartiesÂ’ Positions

(1)

The CrownÂ’s Argument

[13]

Under s. 676(1)(a) of the
Code
, the CrownÂ’s right of appeal
    from an acquittal is limited to Â“any ground of appeal that involves a question
    of law aloneÂ”.

[14]

In
R. v. J.M.H.
, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, the Supreme
    Court of Canada identified four, non-exhaustive, categories of cases in which
    alleged shortcomings in a trial judgeÂ’s assessment of the evidence constitute
    an error of law, thereby allowing appellate review of an acquittal.Â  Justice Cromwell,
    writing for the court, described these categories as follows, at paras. 25-32:

1)

it is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no
    supporting evidence. However, a conclusion that the trier of fact has a
    reasonable doubt is not a finding of fact for the purposes of this rule.
    Rather, it is a conclusion that the standard of persuasion beyond a reasonable
    doubt has not been met;

2)

the legal effect of findings of fact or of undisputed facts may give
    rise to an error of law;

3)

an assessment of the evidence based on a misapprehension or misdirection
    concerning a legal principle is an error of law; and

4)

a failure to consider all the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue
    of guilt or innocence is also an error of law.

[15]

In this case, the Crown acknowledges that, generally, the trial judge
    correctly stated the legal test set out in s. 150.1(4) and correctly identified
    the key principles underlying that provision. The Crown also accepts the trial
    judgeÂ’s factual findings, as it is obliged to do on an appeal from an
    acquittal.

[16]

However, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred by failing to draw
    the correct legal conclusion from the facts he found, thus bringing this case
    within the second category of cases identified in
R. v.

J.M.H.
as affording appellate review of an acquittal.

[17]

The Crown contends that, on the facts as found by him, the trial judge
    erred in law in concluding that a reasonable person in the respondentÂ’s
    circumstances would not have made any specific inquiries or taken any active
    steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. In other words, the Crown asserts
    that the trial judge erred in articulating and applying the appropriate
    standard of reasonableness against which the respondentÂ’s conduct should be
    measured.

[18]

Specifically, the Crown maintains that many of the indicia of age relied
    on by the respondent to support his subjective belief that the complainants
    were over 16 years of age, which were accepted by the trial judge as obviating
    the need for further inquiry, were inconclusive and insufficient to lead a
    reasonable person to conclude that no further inquiry was required.

(2)

The RespondentÂ’s Argument

[19]

The respondent counters with two arguments.

[20]

First, he argues that the Crown has not raised a question of law alone
    upon which to appeal under s. 676(1)(a) of the
Code
. He says the trial
    judgeÂ’s conclusion as to whether the Crown established that the respondent had failed
    to take all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages amounts to a determination
    of the ultimate issue, namely, whether the Crown met its burden to establish
    its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The CrownÂ’s appeal, which challenges this
    conclusion, therefore constitutes a disguised and impermissible attempt to
    argue that the acquittals were unreasonable.

[21]

In support of this argument, the respondent submits that the second
    category of cases identified in
R. v.

J.M.H.
, set out above
    and relied on by the Crown to ground its appeal, does not licence the Crown to
    appeal from an acquittal based on an argument that the trial judgeÂ’s ultimate
    conclusion was wrong.Â  To conclude otherwise, the respondent says, would run
    afoul of the principles articulated in
R. v. Biniaris
, 2000 SCC 15, [2000]
    1 S.C.R. 381, the presumption of innocence and the CrownÂ’s burden of proof in a
    criminal case. Where, as here, a factual foundation for an acquittal exists,
    that acquittal is not reviewable based solely on the contention that it was
    incorrect or unreasonable.

[22]

Second, the respondent submits that, in any event, the trial judge did
    not err. He correctly identified the relevant legal standard under s. 150.1(4)
    of the
Code

and
    applied it properly to the facts as found. Further, the evidence supports his conclusion
    that the respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’
    ages in all the circumstances.

IV.Â  Â Â Â  Discussion

[23]

In my view, it is unnecessary to address the first issue raised on
    appeal. Assuming, without deciding, that the Crown has raised a question of law
    alone, thereby entitling it to appeal from the respondentÂ’s acquittals, I conclude
    that there is no basis for appellate interference with the trial judgeÂ’s holding
    that the evidence at trial raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the
    respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. I say
    this for the following reasons.

(1)

The Trial Judge Properly Identified the Legal Principles Governing the
    Mistake of Age Defence

[24]

First, I see no error in the trial judgeÂ’s articulation of the legal principles
    governing the mistake of age defence under s. 150.1(4) of the
Code
.

[25]

The Crown concedes that, generally, the trial judge correctly identified
    the legal test for the s. 150.1(4) defence and the applicable legal principles
    underlying the provision. Nevertheless, the Crown points to the following
    passage from the trial judgeÂ’s reasons, at para. 44, to argue that he erred in
    his approach to the defence:

In essence,
I am required to consider whether
individually or as part of a global assessment of the indicia [of the
    complainantsÂ’ ages], and while importing the accusedÂ’s subjective belief,
a
    reasonable person would believe that the person was less than 16 years of age,
    without further inquiry
. If that determination cannot be made on an
    objective basis, the question becomes what further steps a reasonable person
    would have had to take in the circumstances. [Emphasis added.]

[26]

Based on this passage, the Crown contends in its factum that, in
    assessing what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to
    ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages and whether the indicia of age in this case
    were sufficient on their own to obviate any need for further inquiry, the trial
    judge Â“may have been looking for evidence which would suggest that the [c]omplainants
    were under 16, rather than indicia that strongly [support] an inference that
    the [c]omplainants were 16 years or moreÂ”. This allegedly Â“less than stringentÂ”
    approach, the Crown argues, indicates that the trial judge erred: i) by failing
    to apply a purposive approach to the question whether further inquiry was
    required concerning the complainantsÂ’ ages; and ii) by failing to properly
    assess whether the indicia that the complainants were 16 years or older were
    truly compelling.

[27]

I disagree. Read as a whole, the trial judgeÂ’s reasons reveal that he
    appreciated the legal standard established by s. 150.1(4) and that the indicia
    of age said to relieve against the need for further inquiry must be both
    compelling in all the circumstances and directed at whether the complainants
    were more than 16 years of age. I see nothing in his reasons to suggest that
    the trial judge ignored or misconstrued these requirements in his assessment of
    the evidence.

[28]

In his reasons, the trial judge described the pertinent issues at trial
    as Â“whether the accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the
    complainantsÂ” and whether he could avail himself of the mistake of age defence
    provided under s. 150.1(4) of the
Code
: paras. 2 and 23. Later in his
    reasons, at para. 56, the trial judge provided this description of the s.
    150.1(4) mistake of age defence:

The
Code
demands that those who engage in sexual
    activity with young persons will make reasonable efforts to ascertain the age
    of prospective partners. Section 150.1(4) of the
Criminal Code
limits
    the application of the defence of honest but mistaken belief to cases in which
    the accused has taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the
    complainant. This section places an evidential but not persuasive burden on the
    accused. It requires only that there be evidence, which, if true, would result
    in an acquittal.
The evidence need only raise a reasonable doubt, but must
    be directed to Â“allÂ” the reasonable steps that should have been taken. The
    jurisprudence provides that the requirement set out in s. 150.1(4) is an
    earnest inquiry or some other compelling factor which negates the need for an
    inquiry. Whether an accused took all reasonable steps is fact-specific and
    depends on the circumstances
. [Emphasis added.]

[29]

These comments confirm that the trial judge appreciated the legal test
    under s. 150.1(4) and the established principles for the application of the
    mistake of age defence.

[30]

The impugned passage from the reasons relied on by the Crown consists of
    one sentence amidst 16 pages (and 71 paragraphs) of reasons. It precedes the
    trial judgeÂ’s correct enunciation at para. 56 of his reasons, quoted above, of
    the nature and requirements of s. 150.1(4). Notably, at para. 56, the trial
    judge expressly indicated that the inquiry required under s. 150.1(4) is Â“an
    earnest inquiry or some other compelling factor which negates the need for an
    inquiryÂ” and that the question whether the Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” standard has
    been met is Â“fact-specific and depends on the circumstancesÂ”.

[31]

Moreover, the trial judge also explicitly recognized, at para. 63, that:
Â“
[t]here must be some compelling
    factor that obviates the need for an enquiry by the accusedÂ” and Â“
the
    accusedÂ’s subjective belief [as to the complainantÂ’s age] is relevant but not
    determinative of this question.Â”

[32]

Elsewhere in his reasons, at para. 36, the trial judge observed:

In
[
Osborne
]
, the court held that s. 150.1(4)
    imposed Â“more than a casual requirementÂ”. The court also noted that the word
    Â“allÂ” in respect of referencing Â“reasonable stepsÂ” is important. While it is
    only necessary for the accused to create a reasonable doubt, the evidence which
    he uses to establish such doubt must be directed to the word [Â“allÂ”] as much as
    to any other part of the subsection.

[33]

Finally, throughout his reasons, the trial judge focused on whether the
    complainants had portrayed themselves as Â“older than 16Â”. He examined the whole
    of the evidence bearing on this issue and, as I will detail later in these
    reasons, made explicit findings regarding the complainantsÂ’ age-related
    appearance, statements, behaviour and conduct. These included the following
    findings, at para. 60:

It is important to note that
both
[
complainants
]
made unsolicited comments
in the vehicle and at the
    residence
in tandem with their purposeful portrayal of themselves as
[
women
]
who were older than 16
, interspersed with sexually explicit comments
    admittedly to entice the accused in their collective attempt to have Â“funÂ”.
    [Emphasis added.]

[34]

The trial judgeÂ’s reasons must be read as a whole, rather than in a piece-meal
    fashion.Â  In my opinion, viewed in their entirety, they belie the CrownÂ’s
    contention that the trial judge erred in his approach to the s. 150.1(4)
    defence or that he failed to apply the requisite degree of scrutiny to the
    indicia of the complainantsÂ’ ages relied on by the respondent.

[35]

Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in the manner
    urged by the Crown. I would reject this ground of appeal.

(2)

The Trial Judge Properly Applied the Section 150.1(4) Standard

[36]

Where a mistake of age defence is raised under s. 150.1(4), the accused
    must point to some evidence that he or she honestly believed the complainant
    was 16 years or more and that he or she took all reasonable steps to ascertain
    the complainantÂ’s age. If the accused meets this evidentiary burden, the Crown
    is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not have
    the requisite belief or that he or she failed to take all reasonable steps to
    ascertain the complainantÂ’s age:
R. v. L.T.P.
(1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d)
    42 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 16-19;
R. v. Osborne
(1992), 102 Nfld. &amp;
    P.E.I.R. 194 (Nfld. C.A.), at paras. 47-49 and 61.

[37]

In this case, it appears that there was no dispute at trial that the
    respondent subjectively believed that the complainants were over 16 years of
    age. The contentious issue was whether he took all reasonable steps to
    ascertain their true ages.

[38]

The trial judge concluded that the evidence at trial raised a reasonable
    doubt on this core issue and that the Crown failed to meet its burden to prove
    that the respondent did not take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to
    ascertain the complainantsÂ’ ages. The Crown attacks these conclusions on the
    basis that the indicia of age relied on by the respondent, and accepted by the
    trial judge, were inconclusive and uncompelling. The Crown argues that the factual
    circumstances of this case are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to
    whether the respondent took all reasonable steps to ascertain the complainantsÂ’
    ages, as required by s. 150.1(4), and that a reasonable person in the
    respondentÂ’s circumstances would have made further inquiries.

[39]

Again, I disagree.Â  In my opinion, it was open to the trial judge on the
    record before him to conclude that a reasonable person in the respondentÂ’s
    circumstances would not have made any positive inquiries to ascertain the
    complainantsÂ’ ages, based on the compelling indicia of age present in this case.

[40]

Section 150.1(4) mandates an inquiry akin to a due diligence inquiry.
    The analysis involves comparing the steps, if any, taken by an accused to
    determine the complainantÂ’s age with the steps that a reasonable person would
    have taken in those circumstances:
R. v. Saliba
, 2013 ONCA 661, 304
    C.C.C. (3d) 133, at para.
28;
R. v. Dragos
, 2012 ONCA
    538, 111 O.R. (3d) 481, at paras.
29-33.

[41]

In
R. v. L.T.P.
, the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    considered those steps that might be reasonable for an accused to take in order
    to ascertain a complainantÂ’s age. The court stated, at para. 20:

In considering whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused has not taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the
    complainantÂ’s age, the Court must ask what steps would have been reasonable for
    the accused to take in the circumstances.
As suggested in R. v. Hayes,
    supra, sometimes a visual observation alone may suffice.Â  Whether further steps
    would be reasonable would depend upon the apparent indicia of the complainantÂ’s
    age, and the accusedÂ’s knowledge of same, including: the accusedÂ’s knowledge of
    the complainantÂ’s physical appearance and behaviour; the ages and appearance of
    others in whose company the complainant is found; the activities engaged in
    either by the complainant individually, or as part of a group; and the times,
    places, and other circumstances in which the complainant and her conduct are
    observed by the accused
.

Evidence as to the accusedÂ’s
    subjective state of mind is relevant but not conclusive because, as pointed out
    in
R. v. Hayes
at p. 11, Â“[a]n accused may believe that he or she has
    taken all reasonable steps only to find that the trial judge or jury may find
    differentlyÂ”. [Emphasis added.]


[42]

This court has also addressed the issue of what constitutes Â“all
    reasonable stepsÂ” for the purpose of s. 150.1(4). In
R. v. Duran
, 2013
    ONCA 343, 306 O.A.C. 301, at para. 54, Laskin J.A. endorsed the above-quoted
    comments in
R. v. L.T.P.
He also noted, at para. 52, that Â“[t]here is
    no automatic checklist of considerations applicable to every caseÂ”, that what
    constitutes Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” depends on the context and the
    circumstances, and that, Â“in some cases, an accusedÂ’s visual observation of the
    complainant may be enough to constitute reasonable steps.Â”

[43]

In
Duran
, the court was concerned with the adequacy of the
    trial judgeÂ’s jury instructions on what was required to make out the statutory defence
    under s.Â 150.1(4). In that context, Laskin J.A. stated, at para. 53:

In this case, the trial judge should have instructed the jury
    to determine whether what the appellant knew and observed about the complainant
    were all the steps a reasonable person needed to take or whether a reasonable
    person ought to have made further inquiries. In making that determination,
the
    jury should have been told to take account of the following considerations and
    the evidence on them: the accusedÂ’s observation of the complainant; the
    complainantÂ’s appearance and behaviour; the information the complainant told the
    appellant about herself, including any information about her age; and the age
    differential between the appellant and the complainant
. [Emphasis added.]

[44]

These instructions, Laskin J.A. emphasized, would focus the juryÂ’s
    deliberations Â“on the question whether the steps the [accused] had already
    taken Â– what he had observed and what he knew Â– were sufficient without further
    inquiryÂ”: at para. 55.

[45]

In this case, the trial judge expressly considered what the respondent
    had observed and what he knew about the complainants on the night in question. In
    accordance with this courtÂ’s directions in
Duran
, he reviewed the
    evidence of the respondentÂ’s observations of the complainants, the
    complainantsÂ’ appearance and behaviour and the information the complainants
    provided to the respondent about themselves and their ages. In so doing, he made
    the following pertinent findings of fact:

(1)

both
    complainants made unsolicited, sexually-explicit comments in the respondentÂ’s
    vehicle and at his parentsÂ’ home, in tandem with their purposeful portrayal of
    themselves as women who were older than 16 (at para. 60);

(2)

by
    the complainantsÂ’ own admissions, their sexually explicit comments were made to
    entice the respondent, in the complainantsÂ’ self-described attempt to have
    Â“funÂ” (at para. 60);

(3)

V.T.
    admitted that she had no difficulty acting older than her true age, based on
    her routine, unchallenged purchase of cigarettes and liquor, her size and her
    appearance (at para. 47);

(4)

V.T.
    acknowledged that, on the night in question, she had actively portrayed herself
    as older by her physical appearance and demeanour, and by dressing and using
    makeup to achieve this purpose (at paras. 47 and 49);

(5)

V.T.
    admitted that, while in the respondentÂ’s car, the complainants told him they had
    just been at a college party and missed their ride. She also confirmed that
    both she and A.S. had made sexually suggestive comments to the respondent,
    while travelling in his vehicle (at para. 47);

(6)

V.T.
    admitted on cross-examination that she had never informed the respondent about
    her age, despite her earlier assertion, during her examination-in-chief, that
    she had done so. This non-disclosure was Â“consistent with her stated demeanourÂ”
    on the night in question (at paras. 46 and 61);

(7)

similarly,
    A.S. Â“purposefullyÂ” never provided her age to the respondent. Further, she
    Â“acted in a similar mannerÂ” to that of V.T. (at para. 61);

(8)

both
    complainants admitted that they looked and acted older than their actual ages
    and left the impression that they were older than they in fact were. According
    to A.S., they were able to do so Â“without any effortÂ” (at paras. 64 and 65);

(9)

for
    both girls, it was Â“some badge of honourÂ” to be portrayed as so mature (at
    para. 64); and

(10)

V.T.Â’s Â“self-admittedÂ”
    and A.S.Â’s Â“tacit presentation and demeanourÂ” of Â“wanting to and acting much
    older than their true ages Â… was consistent with the [respondentÂ’s] passive
    observationsÂ” of the complainants (at para. 65).

[46]

The trial judge was also mindful of the significance of the age difference
    between the respondent (40 years old) and the complainants (14 and one-half
    years old (V.T.) and 15 and one-half years old (A.S.)). Citing
R. v. R.A.K.
(1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 93 (N.B.C.A.), he stated, at para. 37 of his reasons:

The facts in each situation dictate as to what constitutes
    reasonable steps in the circumstances. The court [in
R. v. R.A.K.
] also
    opined at page 96 that the age differential between the accused and the
    complainant would be relevant in determining whether the steps taken are
    reasonable as: Â“almost without exception, the greater the disparity in ages,
    the more inquiry will be required.Â” Indeed, in this case there is a significant
    disparity in the ages of the participants.

[47]

The trial judge returned to this factor later in his reasons. He noted
    the respondentÂ’s admission that he had not expressly asked the complainants
    about their respective ages and said, at para. 55:

The accused testified that he was married at the time with
    young children. I am not here to judge his morality.
However, the
    accusedÂ’s age and the discrepancy here is not lost on me
. [Emphasis
    added.]

[48]

However, given his factual findings about the respondentÂ’s observations
    and the information available to him, the trial judge held that no further inquiries
    were required to satisfy the Â“all reasonable stepsÂ” standard.Â  He stated with
    reference to the complainantsÂ’ evidence, at para. 59:

The evidence that I accept from the complainants on the issue
    of all reasonable steps to ascertain their age is that, in the later evening
    hours, they were boldly hitchhiking, subsequently they requested and were in
    fact, dropped off close to midnight in another part of the City, they claimed
    they had just come from a college party and had missed their ride; they openly
    discussed explicit sexual behaviour with the other sex and with their own
    gender in the accusedÂ’s vehicle and without any prompting from him; they
    discussed having just finished high school and were desirous of consuming
    alcohol and smoking cigarettes.

[49]

The trial judge set out his ultimate conclusion, at para. 66 of his
    reasons, in these terms:

It is the second branch of
R. v. W.(D.)
that is at
    play here. I find that the accusedÂ’s evidence raises a reasonable doubt. In my
    opinion, the complainantsÂ’ demonstrated actions, demeanour and self-professed
    stated objectives and portraying themselves older than their true ages, along
    with the constellation of factors did not require further enquiries from the
    accused.

[50]

On the evidentiary record in this case, I see no reversible error in this
    conclusion. Section 150.1(4) of the
Code
does not require that an
    accused make every possible inquiry to ascertain a complainantÂ’s age in order
    to successfully mount a mistake of age defence. Nor do the established
    authorities suggest that an accused must always expressly question a complainant
    about his or her age, or otherwise seek and obtain conclusive proof of age, in
    order to avail himself or herself of the s. 150.1(4) defence. Rather, the
    section requires that
all

reasonable
steps be taken to
    ascertain a complainantÂ’s age. As the trial judge recognized, what is
    Â“reasonableÂ” will vary, depending on the context and all the circumstances.

[51]

In this case, based on the facts as he found them and for cogent reasons
    that he explained, the trial judge concluded that the evidence at trial raised a
    reasonable doubt on the central issue whether the respondent took all
    reasonable steps to ascertain the complainants' ages. In reaching this
    conclusion, the trial judge recognized that the respondentÂ’s and the
    complainantsÂ’ credibility and the question whether the complainants had
    represented themselves to the respondent as over 16 years of age were critical issues.
    In evaluating these issues, he took express account of the governing principles
    regarding the mistake of age defence under s. 150.1(4) of the
Code
,
    including those set out in
R. v. L.T.P.


[52]

The trial judge also fully canvassed the available indicia of the
    complainantsÂ’ ages, as established in the evidence. On his findings, the complainants
    essentially admitted at trial that they had engaged in a deliberate, premeditated,
    and successful attempt to present themselves as older than 16. Further, their appearance,
    actions and words, and the information they conveyed to the respondent about
    themselves and their ages were specifically designed to achieve this end. The
    respondentÂ’s counsel put it succinctly in their factum:

The information which was provided to the respondent included
    that the complainants had finished high school, that they had just left a
    college party, that they enjoyed smoking, drinking, and partying, that they
    were sexually open and experienced, and that they intended to have a sexual
    encounter that night. Their appearance, including their make-up, dress and
    comportment, was consistent with the information provided. When they returned to
    the respondentÂ’s parentÂ’s home, the complainants were sexually forward and
    acted in a way that was consistent with the age[s] they portrayed.

[53]

Of course, this does not mean that a complainantÂ’s conduct and
    appearance will always obviate the need for further inquiry about the
    complainantÂ’s age.Â  A reasonable person would appreciate that underage children
    may apply make-up and dress and act so as to appear older.Â  However, in this
    case, it is my view that the combined effect of the evidence of the information
    provided to the respondent and the observations made by him justified the trial
    judgeÂ’s conclusion that the need to inquire further about the complainantsÂ’
    ages was obviated.

[54]

Accordingly, in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, it was
    open to the trial judge to conclude, on the compelling factors that he
    identified, that a reasonable person would have been satisfied that the complainants
    were over the age of 16, just as the complainants intended, without the need
    for further inquiry.

V.Â  Â Â Â Â  Disposition

[55]

For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: R. v. Coderre, 2016 ONCA 276

DATE: 20160419

DOCKET: C55920

MacPherson, MacFarland and LaForme JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Her Majesty the Queen

Respondent

and

Terrance Coderre

Appellant

Eva Tache-Green, for the appellant

Michael Fawcett, for the respondent

Heard: April 7, 2016

On appeal from the convictions entered on January 26,
    2012 by Justice Robert B. Reid of the Superior Court, sitting without a jury.

H.S. LaForme J.A.:

INTRODUCTION

[1]

The appellant appeals from convictions related to the unlawful
    cultivation of marijuana and the possession of firearms. He argues that the
    evidence seized by the police while executing a search warrant at his home should
    have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the
Charter
. For the reasons that
    follow, I disagree and would dismiss the appeal.

(1)

The first search

[2]

The police started an investigation into the appellantÂ’s suspected drug
    dealing activities after receiving inculpatory information from reliable
    informants and anonymous tipsters. On March 2, 2009, they obtained a general
    search warrant pursuant to s. 487.01 of the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46.

The warrant included a statutorily-mandated requirement
    to inform the appellant of the existence and execution of the warrant within
    180 days after the warrantÂ’s execution.

[3]

The warrant was executed on March 18, 2009. The police did not find any
    drugs but they did find evidence consistent with a drug operation. The notice
    period expired on September 14, 2009. The police did not provide the required
    notice before the expiry of the notice period. They did not apply to extend the
    notice period either.

(2)

The second search

[4]

The investigation was put on pause after the first search, but resumed
    on October 1, 2009. The police applied for a second warrant under the
Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act,
S.C. 1996, c. 19 (Â“
CDSA
Â”). The
CDSA
warrant was obtained using an Information to Obtain (Â“ITOÂ”) which included
    information obtained during the first search. The second warrant was executed
    on October 8, 2009. The appellant was informed of the first warrant and search
    at this time. During the second search, the police seized drugs and weapons.

THE

CHARTER
APPLICATION

[5]

The appellant brought an application to exclude all of the evidence
    seized by the police during the second search. The application was dismissed
    and, as a result, the appellant did not contest a finding of guilt.

[6]

The trial judge correctly recognized that
    he needed to address two separate issues: first, whether the evidence at issue
    was acquired Â“in a manner that infringedÂ” a
Charter
-protected right; and, second, whether the admission
    of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[7]

The appellant conceded that the first
    search warrant was properly obtained and properly executed. Thus, the trial
    judge focused on whether the failure to provide notice within the mandated
    notice period engaged the appellantÂ’s
Charter
rights. He concluded that:

failing to give notice does not engage a
Charter
right, coming as it does after the valid issuing and proper execution of the
    warrant. This is especially so when no evidence to be used against the
    applicant was located in the search.

[8]

The trial judge also noted that the only
    evidence obtained during the first search used in the ITO was corroboration
    about the location of security cameras. That information, he said, was not
    necessary to obtain the second warrant and could easily be excised.

[9]

The evidence seized during the second search, the trial judge concluded,
    was not obtained in a manner that engaged s. 24(2). The trial judgeÂ’s
    conclusion rested on the fact that there was no temporal nexus between that
    failure to provide notice and the evidence obtained from the second search.
    That is the second search was Â“too remote from the alleged breachÂ”. Accordingly,
    he held that the evidence seized by the police was not obtained in a manner
    that violated the
Charter
.

[10]

The
    trial judge went on to consider the evaluative component of the s. 24(2)
    analysis. He concluded that even if the evidence was obtained in a manner that
    infringed the
Charter
, he would not exclude it under s. 24(2). The
    trial judge laid out and then considered the three factors from
R. v. Grant
, 2009 SCC 32,Â  [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, as follows
:

(i)
Seriousness
    of the Charter-infringing conduct:
There was no bad faith on the part
    of the police officers and they fully disclosed the failure to provide notice
    when obtaining the second warrant.

(ii)
The
    impact of the breach on the accused:
The impact on the appellantÂ’s
Charter
-protected
    right was minimal because if the police had requested an extension they would
    have obtained it and they ended up telling the appellant about the search 23
    days after the notice period expired.

(iii)
SocietyÂ’s
    interest in adjudication on the merits:
Given the importance of the
    evidence seized to the CrownÂ’s case, societyÂ’s interest in adjudicating the
    charges on their merits favoured inclusion.

ISSUES

[11]

The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in three ways: (i) in failing to
    find that non-compliance with the notice requirement infringed s. 8; (ii) by
    concluding that the connection between breach of the notice requirement and
    obtaining the evidence at issue was too remote; and (iii) in concluding that
    the conduct of the police did not amount to bad faith.

ANALYSIS

(1)

Did the trial judge err in concluding that the failure to provide notice
    did not infringe the appellantÂ’s s.8 rights?

[12]

The
    Crown concedes that the failure to provide notice infringed s. 8 of the
Charter
.
    I agree.

[13]

In
R. v. Tse
, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R.
    531, the court held that Â“
[a] requirement of after-the-fact notice casts
    a constitutionally important light back on the statutorily authorised
    intrusionÂ” and that s. 8 protects an Â“ability to identify and challenge such
    invasions, and to seek a meaningful remedy.Â” The failure to abide by a
    statutorily-mandated requirement to provide notice fails to give effect to
    those protections and, therefore, infringes the
Charter
.

(2)

Did the trial judge err in concluding that the evidence was not obtained
    in a manner that infringed the
Charter
?

[14]

In order to engage s. 24(2), a defendant needs to show
    that the impugned evidence was obtained Â“in a manner that infringedÂ” a
Charter
-protected right.
That requirement will be
    satisfied where, on a review of the entire course of events, a court is
    satisfied that the breach and the obtaining of the evidence was part of the
    same transaction or course of conduct. Courts will take a generous approach
    when evaluating this threshold issue. The connection between the breach and the
    obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination
    of the three.Â The connection must be more than tenuous:
R. v.

Plaha
(2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 45.

[15]

With respect, the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence
    seized during the second search was not obtained in a manner that infringed s.
    8. In his analysis, the trial judge focused primarily on the temporal
    connection between the breach and the seizing of the evidence. On that basis,
    he concluded that the connection was too remote.

[16]

While
the connection between the failure to provide notice
    and the seizure of the evidence at issue is arguably weak, it is not tenuous.
    In my view, the two
clearly
occurred as a
    part of the same police investigation.
In his reasons the trial judge
    notes that, after the first search, the police paused their investigation and
    that Â“[on] October 1, 2009, the
investigation was
    continued
under the direction of a different police officerÂ” (emphasis
    added). And he further noted that:

Based on the evidence, it is reasonable to assume that since
the investigation had not been concluded, but rather
    temporarily deferred
, there was no desire on the part of the police to
    give notice to the police within the 180 day time frame,
since
    to do so would jeopardize the ongoing investigation
. [Emphasis added.]

[17]

It
    was obvious to the trial judge that, although different police officers picked
    up the investigation later on, this was one continuous investigation and not
    two separate ones. This certainly suggests that what occurred in this case was
    part of the same transaction or course of conduct.

[18]

Moreover, I would highlight the fact that the police
    chose not to inform the appellant of the
f
irst
s
earch because they concluded that doing
    so would undermine their investigation
. That deliberate choice, in my
    opinion, connects the breach at issue to the second search warrant and the evidence
    obtained through its execution. Therefore, the evidence at issue was obtained
    in a manner that infringed a
Charter
-protected right.

(3)

Did the trial judge err in not excluding the evidence under s. 24(2) of
    the
Charter
?

[19]

In my view, in spite of the errors noted, the trial
    judgeÂ’s decision to not exclude the evidence should be upheld. I reach this
    conclusion for several reasons
.

[20]

First,
    the trial judgeÂ’s conclusion that the police did not engage in bad faith is
    reasonable and supported by the evidence. Here, at the first stage of the
Grant
analysis, the court Â“must consider the seriousness of the violation,
    viewed in terms of the gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities
    whom the rule of law requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the
Charter
Â”:
R. v. Dhillon
, 2010 ONCA 582, 260 C.C.C. (3d) 53, at para. 46.

[21]

Contrary to the appellantÂ’s assertions, the police
    negligence in this case is not the kind of systemic negligence or failure
    described in
Grant
at paras. 73-74
. The appellantÂ’s arguments suggesting that the police officer asking for
    the second warrant misled the issuing justice are not convincing. In fact, as
    noted by the trial judge, the police disclosed their failure to provide notice
    in the ITO for the second warrant. I agree with the trial judgeÂ’s conclusion
    that the policeÂ’s conduct was at worst negligent and did not demonstrate a
    deliberate disregard for the appellantÂ’s rights.

[22]

Second,
    the appellant has not seriously attacked the trial judgeÂ’s findings on the
    other two
Grant
factors. While the second search targeted the
    appellantÂ’s home, which attracts significant
Charter
protection, it
    seems clear that the police would have obtained an extension of the notice
    period if they had applied for it. In that case, the police would have complied
    with the
Charter
and the appellant would still have been subject to
    the second search. And, at the end of the day, the police did inform the
    appellant of the first search and he had an opportunity to challenge its
    legality. Therefore, the impact on the appellantÂ’s
Charter
-protected
    interest was attenuated.

[23]

Finally, there is no reason to question the trial
    judgeÂ’s conclusion that societyÂ’s interest in adjudicating the case on its
    merits favours including the evidence. As such, all three
Grant
factors favour including the evidence.

DISPOSITION

[24]

For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

The President of the panel hearing this appeal directs
    that the following should be attached to the file:

    public, if the judge or justice is of the opinion that such an order is in the
    interest of public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper
    administration of justice or is necessary to prevent injury to international
    relations or national defence or national security.

(1.1) The application may be made, during the
    proceedings, to the presiding judge or justice or, before the proceedings
    begin, to the judge or the justice who will preside at the proceedings or, if
    that judge or justice has not yet been determined, to any judge or justice
    having jurisdiction in the judicial district where the proceedings will take
    place.

(2)Â Â Â Â  In determining whether the order is in the
    interest of the proper administration of judge, the judge or justice shall
    consider

(a) societyÂ’s interest in encouraging the

(g) the salutary and deleterious effects of the
    proposed order; and

(h) any other factor that the judge or justice
    considers relevant.

    section 163.1, 171, 171.1, 172, 172.1, 172.2, 173, 271, 272, 273, 279.01,
    279.011, 279.02, 279.03, 286.1, 286.2 or 286.3 and the prosecutor or the
    accused applies for an order under subsection (1), the judge or justice shall,
    if no such order is made, state, by reference to the circumstances of the case,
    the reason for not making an order.

(4) No adverse inference may be drawn from the fact that an
    order is, or is not, made under this section.

D.B.M.

Sarah Shaikh, for the respondent

Heard:Â  April 7, 2016

On appeal from the conviction entered on September 10,
    2013 by Justice M. Block of the Ontario Court of Justice.

ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The only issue facing the trial judge was whether there was any Â“air of
    realityÂ” to the appellantÂ’s assertion of the defence of duress to the charge of
    possession of about 7 lbs of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.

[2]

The evidence disclosed that the appellant was indebted to a Â“Mr. XÂ” for
    about $40,000 that he had borrowed from

Mr. X.

[3]

Through a series of unfortunate circumstances, including the loss of his
    job, the appellant was unable to pay the debt. Mr. X as it turned out, was an
    unsavoury character who threatened the appellant and his family when the appellant
    was unable to pay.

[4]

Mr. X proposed that the appellant could Â“work offÂ” the debt by making
    deliveries and pick-ups of drugs. The appellant, whose credit was Â“maxed outÂ”
    and had no other source of ready income, agreed to the proposal. He was caught
    on his 9th or 10th pick-up/delivery with seven lbs of marijuana in his vehicle.

[5]

The trial judge reviewed the law of duress as it had been recently
    stated by the Supreme Court in
R. v. Ryan
; he itemized the six
    necessary elements for the defence to succeed. He found that the appellant was
    unable to satisfy the requirement that he had no safe avenue of escape. First,
    it was not clear to him on the evidence that the Â appellant lacked the
    resources to pay the debt, and second, he could have gone to the police.

[6]

The facts here are not unlike those in
R. v. Keller
, 1998 A.J.
    No 1257, a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal. Mr. Keller was arrested at
    the Calgary Airport where heÂ’d picked up a package containing 240 hits of LSD.
    He was searched and 50 additional hits were found in his wallet. He admitted to
    picking up at least 10 similar packages in the four months preceding his
    arrest. He said he was compelled to do so under a threat of death or serious
    bodily harm made by a man he knew as Â“ShawnÂ”, a known drug dealer. Keller was
    indebted to Shawn as the result of inadvertently destroying a quantity of
    ShawnÂ’s drugs. Sometime later, Shawn appeared and demanded either payment or
    that Keller work off the debt. Keller couldnÂ’t pay. He said he did not go to
    the police because he was afraid of Shawn and didnÂ’t think the police could
    protect him. He felt he would be unsafe moving to B.C. where his mother, with
    whom he enjoyed a good relationship, lived; he told no one about the threats or
    his activities because he was embarrassed. He claimed his involvement was
    solely to pay off his debt to Shawn. Keller, like the appellant here, said he
    felt he had no choice but to comply with ShawnÂ’s demands. As the court noted:

... while the common law defence of duress was potentially
    available to Keller it was, like any other defence, not actually available
    unless it had Â‘an air ofÂ Â Â Â  realityÂ’.

[7]

And at para 24:

... the existence of a safe avenue of escape is to be
    determined on an objective standard and is adjusted for subjective
    circumstances. The belief of the accused that he had no reasonable alternative
    is not sufficient to give an air of reality to the defence simply because the
    belief is asserted. The question is whether a reasonable person, with similar
    history, personal circumstances, Â Â Â Â abilities, capacities and human frailties
    as the accused, would, in the particular circumstances, reasonably believe
    there was no safe avenue of escape and that he had no choice but to yield to
    coercion.

[8]

Contrary to the appellantÂ’s assertion, the trial judge here did not
    reverse the onus of proof. There was an evidentiary burden on the appellant to
    lead sufficient evidence to establish an air of reality to the defence of
    duress Â– once satisfied, it remained for the Crown to establish guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt.

[9]

Whether there was a safe avenue of escape is a question of fact. Here
    the trial judge concluded on the evidence before him that he was not satisfied
    that the appellant had no safe avenue of escape, he could have gone to the
    police or paid off the debt by liquidating his RRSPs as he eventually did after
    he was charged with this offence. In other words, there was no air of reality
    to his claim of duress.

[10]

We
    see no error in the trial judgeÂ’s findings.Â  The appeal is dismissed.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: R. v. Harflett, 2016 ONCA 248

DATE: 20160406

DOCKET: C59518

Watt, Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Her Majesty the Queen

Respondent

and

Alexander Harflett

Appellant

Malcolm McRae and Erec Rolfe, for the appellant

Rick Visca, for the respondent

Heard: March 1, 2016

On appeal from the conviction entered on March 24, 2014
    by Justice Catherine Kehoe of the Ontario Court of Justice.

Lauwers J.A.:

[1]

Constable Robert Sinclair was a member of
    the
East

Region Highway Enforcement

Team,
    responsible for monitoring traffic on Highway 401.
He was accompanied by
Tyler Brown, then an employee of the Canadian Border Services Agency. They were
    parked at an On Route service centre. Constable Sinclair noticed the
    appellantÂ’s car had QuÃ©bec plates, and wanted to show Mr.Â Brown how to run
    a computer search on QuÃ©bec plates. He discovered that the appellantÂ’s Ontario
    driverÂ’s licence was suspended for unpaid fines. The officer testifie
d
    that by the time he discovered this, the appellant was back on the highway. He
    pursued the appellant and pulled him over about six kilometres down the road.

[2]

The appellant produced a valid QuÃ©bec driverÂ’s licence. The officer
    arrested him for driving with the licence of another jurisdiction while his
    Ontario licence was suspended, and charged him under s. 36 of the
Highway
    Traffic Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8 (Â“
HTA
Â”). The officer conducted
    a pat-down search of the appellant, and read him his rights. He found the
    appellant to be cooperative throughout.

[3]

The appellant could not drive his car since his licence was suspended. The
    officer called a tow truck because the car had to be removed from the highway
    for safety reasons. His plan was to have the car towed to a nearby hotel, with
    the appellant riding with the tow truck operator. The appellant would then be
    in a position to pay the fines the next day, have his licence restored, and
    continue on his way.

[4]

As was his invariable practice, Constable Sinclair performed an
    inventory search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle. He testified that when he opened
    the trunk, he smelled the odour of raw marijuana, and discovered a large quantity
    of the drug. He immediately arrested the appellant for possession of marijuana
    for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2) of the
Controlled Drugs
    and Substances Act
,
S.C.
    1996, c. 19. As the officer was reading the appellant his rights a second time,
    the tow truck arrived. The car was towed to the police detachment and a full
    search was performed.

[5]

At trial, the appellant brought a
Charter
application claiming
    that his s. 8
Charter
rights had been breached by the initial
    inventory search of his vehicle before it was to be towed to a hotel, because
    the officer had no authority to conduct such a search. The trial judge found
    that the inventory search was reasonable and that, even if the appellantÂ’s s. 8
    rights had been breached, s.Â 24(2) of the
Charter
favoured the admission
    of the evidence. The trial judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to
    12 monthsÂ’ imprisonment, plus 12 monthsÂ’ probation.

[6]

This appeal raises two issues: (i) did the trial judge err in not finding
    that the inventory search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle breached his rights under
    s. 8 of the
Charter
; and (ii) if so, did the trial judge err in
    finding the evidence to be admissible under s. 24(2) of the
Charter
?

[7]

For the reasons set out below, I would allow the appeal and exclude the
    evidence under s. 24(2) of the
Charter
.


Issue 1: Did the Vehicle Search Breach the AppellantÂ’s s. 8
Charter
Rights?

[8]

Section 8 of the
Charter
provides that Â“everyone has the right
    to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.Â”

[9]

The trial judge found that the initial inventory search of the vehicle
    was Â“reasonableÂ”, at para. 153. The totality of her reasoning on whether the
    officer breached the appellantÂ’s s. 8
Charter
right is found at para.
    154 of her reasons:

Constable Sinclair had to remove the vehicle from Highway 401,
    the accused could not drive it and there was no one else to drive the vehicle.
    It was therefore the responsibility of Constable Sinclair. It was reasonable to
    assess any pre-existing damage to the vehicle, to verify any valuables in the
    vehicle and whether there were any weapons or other dangerous items in the
    vehicle. Constable Sinclair was going to release the accused and the vehicle to
    a hotel and therefore, had to verify that there was nothing dangerous in the
    vehicle and, prior to the tow to the hotel, the state of the vehicle and
    valuables.

[10]

The
    trial judge accurately recorded the police officerÂ’s testimony about why he did
    the inventory search.

The Governing Principles

[11]

As
    Binnie J. observed, roadside stops Â“sometimes develop in unpredictable waysÂ”:
R.
    v. Nolet
, 2010 SCC 24,
[2010] 1 S.C.R. 851
, at
    para. 4. In such situations the courtÂ’s task is to Â“proceed step-by-step
    through the interactions of the police and the appellants from the initial stop
    onwards to determine whether, as the situation developed, the police stayed
    within their authority, having regard to the information lawfully obtained at
    each stage of their inquiry.Â”

[12]

In
    this case, the officerÂ’s search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle was warrantless, and
    was therefore presumptively unreasonable. To justify a warrantless search, the
    Crown must establish, on the balance of probabilities, that (i) the search was
    authorized by law; (ii) the law is reasonable; and (iii) the search was carried
    out in a reasonable manner: see
R. v. Collins
, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at
    p. 278, [1987] S.C.J. No. 15, at para. 23. The focus in this appeal is on the
    first and second branches of the
Collins

test since the
    appellant concedes the third branch.

[13]

Under
    the first branch of the
Collins
test, Â“the state authority conducting
    the search must be able to point to a specific statute or common law rule that
    authorizes the search. If they cannot do so, the search cannot be said to be
    authorized by lawÂ”:
R. v. Caslake
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 12.

[14]

Under
    the second branch of the
Collins
test, Â“the search must be carried out
    in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements the law
    providesÂ”:
Caslake
, at para 12. The second branch is not reached
    unless the first is met.

The Principles Applied

[15]

The
    appellant argues that the police officerÂ’s search of the appellantÂ’s car fails
    the first branch of the
Collins

test because the police officer
    had neither the statutory nor the common law authority to conduct an inventory
    search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle.

[16]

I
    agree.

[17]

Following
    the Supreme CourtÂ’s guidance in
Nolet
, a

step-by-step analysis
    of the roadside stop shows that the officer had no authority to conduct the
    inventory search.

[18]

I
    begin with the police officerÂ’s reasons for pulling over the appellant and
    detaining him. A roadside stop of a vehicle for a provincial regulatory offence
    under statutes like the
HTA
(e.g. speeding) is a detention: see
R.
    v. Hufsky
, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621;
R. v. Mellenthin
, [1992] 3 S.C.R.
    615; and
R. v. Harrison
, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494.

[19]

I
    am satisfied that the appellantÂ’s initial detention was lawful. Although the
    appellant argues that the police officer acted in bad faith and Â“held offÂ” at
    the OnÂ Route before pulling him over on Highway 401, the trial judge
    rejected this argument. For the reasons outlined below, I also reject this
    argument. The officer was acting pursuant to his statutory authority under the
HTA

when he

detained the appellant to investigate a possible
    contravention of that statute.

[20]

However,
    the power to detain an individual under the
HTA

does not
    inevitably include the power to detain or impound a vehicle, nor does it
    include the power to conduct an inventory search in every situation. The
    officer must be able to point to a specific duty or authority to justify his
    search of the appellantÂ’s vehicle.

[21]

The
    inventory search cannot be justified on the basis of officer safety or any
    suspicion that the appellant was involved in criminal conduct. The officer
    testified that after arresting the appellant for the first time for driving
    while his licence was suspended, he did not impound or seize the appellantÂ’s
    car, because he

was

only

conducting
    a traffic

investigation,

not

a

criminal

investigation. He
agreed
the

appellant

was

polite, cooperative

and

non-confrontational

throughout.

The officer

testified

that there

was,

Â“nothing

to

hint

of

criminality,

zero.

He

[the

appellant]

had

no

prior

criminal

record. He

was

not

listed on

any

of

the

police

records

as

being

involved

in

any

type

of

criminal

activity, he

was

just

simply

a

suspended

driver.Â” The officer agreed

that he had no reason to believe that

the

vehicle
    contained

any weapons or other

dangerous items.

[22]

The
    officer explained that he searches Â“every vehicleÂ” for which he calls a tow
    truck. His view was that he was Â“totally responsibleÂ” for the car. The search
    was to protect himself, the appellant, and the tow truck operator. The officer
    checked first for exterior damage to the car. He explained

that in the
interior
search he looked for

weapons,

other

dangerous

items,

and valuable
s
. He was concerned about

weapons

that

the

appellant

might

use

to

harm

the

tow

truck

operator and wished to protect the operator against any allegation that
    he had stolen valuable items from the car.

[23]

Neither
    the police officer nor the trial judge was able to identify any statutory
    provision that authorized police to impound the vehicle or to search the car. The
    Crown indicated in oral argument that he could not identify any statutory
    authority in the
HTA

that justified either step. However, in
    the absence of statutory authority, the common law can provide authority to
    impound a motor vehicle:
R. v. Waugh
,

2
01
0

ON
C
A

10
0, at paras. 25-26. In
Waugh
,
    the question was whether the police had the common law power to impound an
    uninsured vehicle where they suspected that the motorist would continue to
    drive it. BlairÂ J.A. observed, at para. 30: Â“[t]he ability to impound the
    vehicle and have it towed away, in the circumstances, is a reasonable exercise
    of the police common law duty to prevent crimeÂ…, to protect the life and
    property of the public, and to control traffic on the public roads.Â”

[24]

The
    ancillary power doctrine this court relied on in
Waugh

does not
    apply on the facts of this appeal to authorize the inventory search because the
    officer did not in fact impound the vehicle.

[25]

There
    was nothing in the interactions that developed between the officer and the
    appellant, assessed step-by-step as required by
Nolet
, that might have
    triggered the need to do the inventory search. I note that Constable Sinclair
    had no public safety concerns, since he was going to release the car to the
    appellant. Â In
Waugh
, Blair J.A. accepted, at para. 32, that Â“courts
    should be cautious in extending police power by resort to their common law
    ancillary powers, particularly in circumstances where the legislature has put
    in place an elaborate and comprehensive regulatory regime with carefully
    balanced powers and sanctions.Â” This observation manifestly applies to this
    case.

[26]

The
    determination of the reasonableness of the search is contextual, as
Nole
t
and
Mellenthin
state. In this instance it was quite reasonable for the
    officer to look at the exterior of the car and to note any damage before asking
    the tow operator to take it to the hotel. The officer had taken at least that
    degree of control over the car.

[27]

But
    the other reasons given by the officer for the inventory search do not hold up
    to scrutiny and pass constitutional muster. The owner was not going to be separated
    from the car, but was to ride with the tow operator to the hotel. There was
    accordingly no reason for the tow operator to access the interior of the car
    and the police officer had no cause to be concerned for the operatorÂ’s safety.

[28]

I
    reject the CrownÂ’s invitation to apply
R. v. Nicolosi
,

[1998] O.J. No. 2554,
40
    O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.),
at para. 36, where Doherty J.A. noted that:

In
    my view, the logic of
Nicolosi
does not apply in this case. The
    officer had no statutory obligation to take custody of the car and store it in
    a suitable place, nor was that power necessarily incidental to the officerÂ’s
    common law powers in this instance, where the necessary degree of the officerÂ’s
    control was more limited than in
Nicolosi
. Here the officer did not
    impound the vehicle or exercise the degree of control of the vehicle that would
    have made an inventory search necessary. The police decision to call a tow
    truck to remove a vehicle does not justify an inventory search in every case:

R. v. Martin
, 2012 ONSC 2298, at para.Â 36.

[30]

In
    sum, I am satisfied that the officerÂ’s common law authority was limited by the
    real exigencies of the situation: see
Mellenthin
. His duty obliged him
    to get the car off the highway for safety reasons. There was no reasonable
    basis for the officer to go on to undertake an inventory search of the car. Accordingly,
    the officerÂ’s decision to inventory search the car was unreasonable and
    breached the appellantÂ’s s. 8
Charter
right against an unreasonable
    search.

[31]

I
    now turn to consider whether the evidence generated by the search should have
    been excluded by the trial judge in view of the breach.

Issue 2: Did the Trial Judge Properly Apply s. 24(2) of the
Charter
?

[32]

Section
    24(2) of the
Charter
provides:

(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court
    concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any
    rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded
    if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the
    admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice
    into disrepute.

The Governing Principles

[33]

The
    framework for the application of s. 24(2) of the
Charter
is set out in
R.Â v. Grant
,
2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353
,
    at para 71. The court must consider three lines of inquiry: (i) the seriousness
    of the
Charter
-infringing state conduct; (ii) the impact on the
Charter
-protected
    interests of the accused; and (iii) societyÂ’s interest in adjudication on the
    merits.

The Principles Applied

[34]

The
    totality of the trial judgeÂ’s reasoning on the
Grant
analysis is found
    at para. 156:

[G]iven that the vehicle was not, but for the marijuana found
    in the inventory search, going to be impounded, I find that Constable Sinclair
    acted in good faith and, as in
Nolet
, it was a technical breach with
    minimal impact on the
Charter
-protected interests of the accused as
    there is a lower expectation of privacy on the public roadway. The marijuana is
    real evidence and its admission would not bring the administration of justice
    into disrepute.

[35]

The
    appellant concedes that the third line of inquiry Â– societyÂ’s interest in
    adjudication on the merits Â– favours inclusion of the evidence because the
    marijuana is real and reliable evidence of drug trafficking. But the appellant
    argues that the first two lines of inquiry favour exclusion.

The First
Grant
Line of Inquiry

[36]

In
Grant
, the Supreme Court noted, at para. 72, that the function of the
    first line of inquiry into the "seriousness of the
Charter
-infringing
    state conduct" is:

to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public
    that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice,
    effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to
    dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct.

[37]

The
    focus is on the nature and degree of police misconduct. The Court stated at
    para. 72:

[T]he more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to
    the
Charter
violation, the greater the need for the Courts to
    dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that
    conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence
    to the rule of law.

Bad Faith

[38]

At

trial,

the

appellant

challenged

Constable

SinclairÂ’s

testimony

that

he had

already
    driven

away

by

the

time

the

officer discovered

the

expired

licence. The appellant

argued

that
    the officer

had

intentionally

held

off

from

speaking

to
him
at

the

gas

pumps

about
    his

suspended

licence

because

he

wanted
    to pull

the car

over

on

the highway

in

order

to arrest him and search his vehicle. The
    appellant submitted the trial judge erred in failing to rule on, or to provide
    sufficient reasons about, the argument that the police had used this stratagem.

[39]

I
    would reject this argument. In concluding that the police officer was acting in
    good faith throughout, the trial judge showed that she had accepted his
    evidence about the timing of the licence plate search and the appellantÂ’s
    apprehension, and rejected the appellantÂ’s credibility challenge to that evidence.
    The appellant has not demonstrated that the trial judge committed a palpable
    and overriding error in doing so.

A Pattern of Abuse

[40]

The
    appellant argues that Constable Sinclair exhibits a pattern of abusing his
    search authority as a police officer, and that this militates in favour of
    exclusion of the evidence: see
R. v. Little
, [2009] O.J. No. 3385, at
    para. 17. The appellant points to two other reported cases where Constable
    Sinclair was found to have abused his search powers leading to the exclusion of
    evidence.

[41]

In
R. v. Rodrigue
, 2012 ONSC 1739, [2012] O.J. No. 1538, Constable
    Sinclair intercepted another Quebec licensed vehicle, pulled it over, searched
    it and found drugs. The trial judge found that the officer had no reasonable
    grounds to pull over the motorist and that the subsequent search was abusive.
    The trial judge cited
Harrison
and excluded the marijuana on the basis
    of the officerÂ’s deliberate and flagrant violation of Mr. Rodrigue's rights.

[42]

In
R. v. Nguyen
, [2011] O.J. No. 6252 (S.C.), Constable Sinclair was in a
    Highway 401 On Route and saw the accused behaving "suspiciously". He
    pulled over the vehicle and noticed an air freshener and cigarettes. Constable
    Sinclair asked for permission to search the vehicle. He got the accused, a Vietnamese
    immigrant who did not speak English well, to sign a waiver. He then found over
    $100,000 in cash and charged the accused with possession of proceeds of crime. The
    judge found the waiver was not informed due to the significant language
    barrier. The Crown conceded s. 24(2) exclusion.

[43]

As noted, Constable Sinclair testified that he always searches
    cars that he stops. He

was

an

instructor

in

Â“pipeline

techniquesÂ”
and

taught police
    officers and others the skills

to

Â“recognize

indicia

of

the

criminal

element

in

traffic enforcementÂ”

during

Â“traffic stopsÂ”.
    He

testified

that Highway

401

was

a

popular

route for drug

and

weapons

traffickers

and

that

he
    was

always

alive

to possible

criminal

activity

when

conducing

traffic stops.
He testified that,
    as a member of the East Region Highway Enforcement Team, he had been involved
    in over 100 investigations involving large quantities of marijuana. In his
    testimony Constable Sinclair agreed that he is Â“really good at finding ways to
    search motor vehiclesÂ”, adding, however, that he does so Â“lawfullyÂ”.

[44]

I
    do not doubt that Constable Sinclair believes that he is doing the right thing,
    and to that extent shows good faith. But, to borrow the words of MacPherson
    J.A. in
R. v. MacDonald
, 2012 ONCA 495, [2012] O.J. No. 3210, at para.
    35, Constable SinclairÂ’s invariable practice of searching every car fits the
    description of an impermissible Â“fishing expedition conducted at a random
    highway stop". As an instructor of other police officers, he ought to be
    fully conversant with his legal authority, but the evidence shows either that
    he was not or that he was prepared to search regardless. His attitude was
    exemplified by his testimony: he resisted the notion that what he did was a
    Â“searchÂ”: Â“I do an inventory sir, not a searchÂ”. This was plainly a search.

[45]

In my view, the first line of inquiry under
Grant
therefore
    militates in favour of the exclusion of the evidence obtained in violation of
    the appellantÂ’s s. 8 rights. I am satisfied that the state conduct in this case
    falls on the serious end of the spectrum of misconduct described by Doherty
    J.A. in
R. v. Kitaitchik
,
[2002] O.J. No. 2476
,166
    C.C.C. (3d) 14 (C.A.), at para. 41.


The Second
Grant
Line of Inquiry

[46]

The
    second
Grant

line of inquiry "calls for an evaluation of
    the extent to which the breach actually undermined the interests protected by
    the right infringed (para 76)." The relevant right here is to be free from
    unreasonable search under s. 8 of the
Charter
. In that context,
    "[a]n unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual
    reasonably enjoys a high expectation of privacy, or that demeans his or her
    dignity, is more serious than one that does not": see
Grant
, at

para. 78.

[47]

The
    case law has consistently held that drivers have a reduced expectation of
    privacy in their vehicles: see
Caslake
, at para. 15;
Nicolosi
,

at para. 9. However, a reduced expectation
    of privacy does not mean that an unjustified search is permissible. As stated
    by McLachlin C.J. in
Harrison
, Â“[a]
person in the
    appellant's position has every expectation of being left alone - subject, as
    already noted, to valid highway traffic stopsÂ”:

Harrison
,
at paras. 31-32.

[48]

As
    Iacobucci J. noted in
R. v. Mann
, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at
    para. 56, the impact of even a minimally intrusive search Â“must be weighed
    against the absence of
any
reasonable basis for
    justificationÂ”. There was no justification for Constable SinclairÂ’s inventory
    search. I am satisfied the second
Grant
factor also militates in
    favour of the exclusion of the evidence in this case.

The Third
Grant
Line of Inquiry

[49]

The
    third line of inquiry in the
Grant
analysis involves a consideration
    and weighing of society's interest in the determination of the charges on their
    merits. The court must consider whether "the truth-seeking function of the
    criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or
    by its exclusion":
Grant
, at para. 79.

[50]

The
    exclusion of the hard evidence found in the car would gut the prosecution. That
    evidence is conceded by the appellant to be highly reliable. At para. 83 of
Grant
,
    the Court noted that "the exclusion of highly reliable evidence may impact
    more negatively on the repute of the administration of justice where the remedy
    effectively guts the prosecution."

[51]

However,
    I am mindful of the caution referred to by the Supreme Court, at para. 40 of
Harrison
,
    in endorsing the words of Cronk J.A.:

Allowing the seriousness of the offence and the reliability of
    the evidence to overwhelm the s. 24(2) analysis "would deprive those
    charged with serious crimes of the protection of the individual freedoms
    afforded to all Canadians under the
Charter
and, in effect, declare
    that in the administration of the criminal law 'the ends justify the means.'Â”

[52]

In
Harrison
, the Supreme Court acquitted the appellant, where an illegal
    roadside search found 35 kg of cocaine, a far more dangerous drug. The court
    did so, as it noted at para. 37, on the basis that the trial judge had placed
    undue emphasis on the third line of inquiry, and had turned the analysis into a
    contest between the degree of the police misconduct and the seriousness of the
    offence, or, as McLachlin C.J. noted at para 41, Â“between the misdeeds of the
    police and those of the accusedÂ”.

[53]

As
    Cory J. observed in
Mellenthin
, at para. 27:

The unreasonable search carried out in this case is the very
    kind which the Court wished to make clear is unacceptable. A check stop does
    not and cannot constitute a general search warrant for searching every vehicle,
    driver and passenger that is pulled over. Unless there are reasonable and
    probable grounds for conducting the search, or drugs, alcohol or weapons are in
    plain view in the interior of the vehicle, the evidence flowing from such a
    search should not be admitted.

[54]

In
    my view, the third
Grant
factor cannot be used to systematically
    require the admission of reliable evidence obtained in plain disregard of an
    accusedÂ’s
Charter
rights. This is a case in which s. 24(2) of the
Charter
must be applied so as to ensure that the administration of justice is not
    undermined by the admission of evidence obtained in violation of an accusedÂ’s
Charter
rights.

[55]

I
    am mindful of the Supreme CourtÂ’s caution in
Grant
that where the
    trial judge has considered the three lines of inquiry, appellate courts should
    defer to the trial judgeÂ’s ultimate decision. Deference is not warranted in
    this case because the trial judgeÂ’s reasoning on the application of s. 24(2) of
    the

Charter
was sparse, deficient and erroneous in material
    ways.

[56]

The
    trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence should not be excluded. Her
    classification of the s. 8 breach as Â“technical,Â” as described in
Nolet
,
    was incorrect. In
Nolet
, the breach was considered Â“technicalÂ” because
    the fruits of the illegal search would have been discovered if the police had continued
    their prior lawful search:
Nolet
, at para. 54. Here, Constable
    Sinclair had no authority to conduct any type of search of the interior of the
    vehicle. The trial judge further erred by holding that the impact of this
    breach was Â“minimalÂ” simply because the appellant had a lower expectation of
    privacy in his vehicle on a public roadway. The impact of an unjustified search
    is magnified where there is a total absence of justification for it.

Disposition

[57]

Taking together the three
Grant
lines of inquiry, I
    conclude that the evidence should be excluded. The state misconduct was serious
    and the impact on the appellantÂ’s
Charter
rights was significant. As
    McLachlin C.J. observed in
Harrison
, at para. 42, Â“
the price paid by society for an acquittal in these circumstances
    is outweighed by the importance of maintaining
Charter
standardsÂ”.

[58]

I would allow the appeal, exclude the evidence obtained in
    violation of the appellantÂ’s
Charter
rights.
Because the evidence in question was essential to the Crown's
    case, rather than order a new trial, I would enter an acquittal, as the Supreme
    Court did in
Harrison
.

Appellant

Venus Sayed, for the appellant

Stephen Dawson, for the respondent

Heard: March 24, 2016

On appeal from the conviction entered on August 12, 2014
    and the sentence imposed on December 17, 2014 by Justice C.D. Anderson of the Ontario
    Court of Justice.

ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The appellant appeals her conviction of possession of 48 pounds of
    marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and seeks leave to appeal her sentence
    of imprisonment for a term of six months imposed as a result of that
    conviction.

[2]

The appellant was the driver of a sport utility vehicle that was pulled
    over by a police officer on Highway 401 in Eastern Ontario. In a cardboard box
    in the cargo area of the vehicle, police located several bags of packaged marijuana.

[3]

The genesis of the traffic stop was a report from another police officer
    about unsafe driving and observations by the arresting officer who followed the
    vehicle for several kilometers. The officer who stopped the vehicle approached
    it. He made several observations as he waited for the occupants, in particular
    the appellant, to produce information he requested of them. Both occupants
    seemed nervous. The appellant kept looking back towards two large black
    suitcases in the rear of the vehicle. There were several cellphones on the
    console. The officer detected a strong smell of raw marijuana from the vehicle.
    As he walked by the vehicle to return to his cruiser, the officer noticed a
    cardboard box with Ziploc bags protruding from it containing material of the
    shape and size of marijuana. He made this observation through heavily tinted
    windows.

[4]

On his return to his cruiser, the officer conducted a CPIC check on his
    computer. He returned to the vehicle driven by the appellant and arrested the
    appellant and her passenger on a charge of possession of marijuana for the
    purpose of trafficking.

[5]

The appellant advances three grounds of appeal against conviction. She says
    that the trial judge erred:


i.

in failing to find that the
    police lacked reasonable grounds to detain the appellant and thereby lacked the
    authority to search the vehicle incident to her arrest;


ii.

in failing to exclude the marijuana
    as evidence obtained by
Charter
infringement under s.24(2) of the
Charter
;
    and


iii.

in misapprehending the evidence
    of the arresting officer and thereby rendering an unreasonable verdict based on
    his evidence.

[6]

We would not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal.

[7]

We are satisfied, as the appellant acknowledges, that the initial
    traffic stop was fully justified under s. 216(1) of the
Highway Traffic Act
.
    The same may be said of the request for documents identifying the occupants and
    the authority of the driver to operate the vehicle with appropriate insurance
    coverage. Any additional purpose the officer had was neither improper nor did
    it entail an infringement on the liberty or security of the occupants beyond
    what is contemplated by the purpose animating s.216(1) of the
Highway
    Traffic Act
. See,
Brown v. Regional Municipality of Durham Police
    Service Board
, (1998) 116 O.A.C. 126, at para. 31.

[8]

We are equally satisfied that the trial judge made no error in
    concluding that the investigating officer had reasonable and probable grounds
    to arrest the appellant for possession of marijuana.

[9]

When the officer reached the vehicle, he detected a strong odour of raw
    marijuana. New air fresheners hung from the rear-view mirror. Several
    cellphones were in the vehicle. Both occupants were nervous. The appellant repeatedly
    looked back at the large bags in the rear seat or cargo area. The officer
    noticed a large box with bags containing a substance that resembled marijuana
    in size and shape protruding from it. The cumulative effect of these
    observations amounted to reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the
    appellant. It followed that the search of the vehicle incident to the lawful
    arrest and carried out in a reasonable manner was constitutionally valid.

[10]

The
    trial judge found a breach of s.10(b) when the arresting officer did not inform
    the appellant of her s.10(b) rights immediately upon arrest. The informational
    component of the right was delayed three to four minutes. The trial judge
    rejected the appellantÂ’s claim that she did not speak to a lawyer, rather only to
    an interpreter, after the investigating officer called the toll-free number for
    duty counsel advice and, in accordance with his usual practice, requested a
    response from a Vietnamese-speaking lawyer. We see no basis upon which to interfere
    with this finding or the trial judgeÂ’s decision to admit the real evidence
    found in the vehicle.

[11]

The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal the sentence of imprisonment for a term of
    six months imposed upon her. She says the trial judge erred in failing to
    impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment. The sentence imposed at trial,
    she contends, is demonstrably unfit for a 52 year-old first offender, the sole
    support of her daughter, a university student. A conditional sentence order
    would permit her to continue operating her business, to maintain her home, and
    would also achieve the predominant sentencing objectives.

[12]

We
    would not interfere with the sentence imposed at trial. We measure the sentence
    imposed for its adherence to the cardinal principle of sentencing Â–proportionality
    Â– regardless of whether trial judge erred in principle when crafting it. We see
    no error in principle in the judgeÂ’s approach or any misapprehension of
    relevant evidence, let alone any error that had an impact on the sentence
    ultimately imposed.

[13]

The
    offence involved a significant quantity of marijuana. The crime was motivated
    entirely by financial gain. The offender who committed it, by her own
    admission, gave perjured testimony on the
voir dire
, if not on the
    trial proper in a desperate effort to escape conviction.

[14]

The
    appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but
    the appeal from sentence is dismissed.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: R. v. Woolridge, 2016 ONCA 302

DATE: 20160425

DOCKET: C60585

Doherty, Watt and Miller JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Her Majesty the Queen

Respondent

and

Calvin Woolridge

Appellant

Joseph Di Luca and Michael Wendl, for the appellant

Davin M. Garg, for the respondent

Heard and released orally: April 12, 2016

On appeal from the sentence imposed on December 23, 2014
    by Justice
Richard E. Jennis
of the Ontario Court of
    Justice.

ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The appellant appeals a net or effective sentence of 3 years, 7 months
    imposed after he pleaded guilty to a single count of robbery.

[2]

The sentencing judge considered that a sentence of 4 years, 10 months
    was fit for the robbery conviction, but reduced it to 3 years, 7 months because
    of the time the appellant had spent in pre-disposition custody which the
    sentencing judge credited at the rate of 1.25:1.

[3]

At the same time, the sentencing judge imposed sentences of one month on
    each of two counts of theft under $5,000, upon which the Crown proceeded by
    indictment. The sentences were made consecutive to each other, and to the
    sentence imposed on the robbery conviction. Neither the quantum of those
    sentences, nor the order that they be served consecutively to each other and to
    the robbery sentence, is in issue on appeal.

[4]

Before the sentencing judge, Crown counsel sought a penitentiary
    sentence of 4 to 8 years, less credit for pre-disposition custody. Defence
    counsel sought a sentence that would permit service of it in a reformatory so
    that the appellant could receive the benefit of substance abuse programs said
    to be more effective there than in the penitentiary.

[5]

The appellant advances two grounds of appeal. He says that the
    sentencing judge erred in failing to award him credit on a 1.5:1 basis for the
    time he spent in pre-disposition custody. Second, he contends that the
    sentencing judge erred in the quantum of sentence he imposed by placing undue
    weight on the appellantÂ’s criminal record.

[6]

The respondent acknowledges that the sentencing judge erred in failing
    to award credit for pre-disposition custody at the rate of 1.5:1, but submits
    that the sentence imposed is otherwise free of error. In fairness to the
    sentencing judge, he based his conclusion on this issue on a decision of this
    court that was overtaken by subsequent authority not available to the
    sentencing judge at the time he imposed sentence.

[7]

Apart from awarding enhanced credit for pre-disposition custody, we
    would dismiss the appeal.

[8]

In light of
R. v. Lacasse
, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, we
    are permitted to intervene with a sentence imposed at first instance only where
    the sentencing judge has erred in principle; failed to consider a relevant factor;
    or erred in his or her consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor;
    and that such an error had an impact on the sentence imposed.

[9]

The assignment of weight to aggravating and mitigating factors in
    determining a fit sentence is quintessentially a matter for the sentencing
    judge. Here, the sentencing judge was dealing with a mature recidivist with
    nearly seven dozen convictions on a record that spanned almost a quarter-century.
    The offence committed was a brazen and planned robbery accompanied by the use
    of an imitation weapon. Deterrence and denunciation dominated the sentencing
    calculus. The sentencing judge considered rehabilitation but accorded it, as he
    was entitled to do, a place of lesser influence.

[10]

Apart from adjusting the pre-disposition custody credit, we see no reason
    to interfere with this sentence.

[11]

We reduce the
remanet
of this sentence by 94 days to reflect
    the credit of 1.5:1, rather than 1.25:1. This leaves a net sentence on the
    robbery conviction of 3 years, 5 months and 15 days. Otherwise the appeal, from
    sentence is dismissed.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: Quenneville (Re) 2016 ONCA 295

DATE: 20160422

DOCKET: C60753

Strathy C.J.O., Gillese and Pardu JJ.A.

IN THE MATTER OF: Denis Quenneville

AN APPEAL UNDER PART XX.1 OF
    THE
CODE

Sukhpreet Sangha, for the appellant

John Patton, for the Attorney General of Ontario

Janice Blackburn, for the person in charge of Waypoint
    Centre for Mental Health Care

Heard: April 21, 2016

On appeal against the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board dated May 28, 2015.

ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The appellant argues that the decision of the Ontario Review Board that
    he continue to be detained at the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care was
    unreasonable. He submits that the opinion of his treating physician that he had
    made progress in the recent year, and that he would benefit from a less secure
    environment should have been accepted by the Board. He would like to be
    transferred to either the Brockville Mental Health Centre or the Royal Ottawa
    Mental Health Centre, so that he can be closer to his family, and so that he
    can enjoy some easing of the restrictions associated with Waypoint. The
    appellant had spent time at the Brockville facility in the past.

[2]

Dr. Ahmed, member of the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre, opposed the
    transfer. He reviewed the hospital report filed in this matter and took the
    position that the appellantÂ’s risk Â“continues to be at a level higher than can
    be safely managedÂ” at those facilities. He did not consider that the appellant
    had made any significant progress and was concerned that as a result of a
    program of major renovation, there was a reduction of beds available for
    admission.

[3]

There was no dispute that the appellant remained a significant threat,
    and no dispute that continued hospitalization was required.

[4]

The Board noted in its reasons, Â“While the Board commends Mr.Â Quenneville
    for his progress during the review period, we find that a transfer to a less
    secure institution is premature given Mr. QuennevilleÂ’s ongoing threatening and
    sexually inappropriate behaviour as documented in the Hospital ReportÂ”. That
    report discloses that the appellant continued to make threats to kill, torture,
    rape and injure other persons. His last violent outburst occurred in June 2014
    when he threw a 70 pound chair in his room which broke off a door handle.

[5]

The reasons of the Board are adequate, clearly explaining why it came to
    the conclusions it did.

[6]

The appellant was making some progress at Waypoint with the benefit of
    Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. There was some question whether the same kind
    of treatment would be available to him at the other institutions.

[7]

The BoardÂ’s decision is owed deference. As recently observed by this
    court in
Hart (Re)
, 2016 ONCA 277:

The standard of review of a disposition or placement decision
    of the Board is set out in s. 672.78(1) of the
Criminal Code
, and its
    application was explained in
R. v Owen
, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R.
    779, at paras. 31-37. This court can only set aside an order of the Board where
    it is of the opinion that:

1. the decision is unreasonable or cannot be supported by
    the evidence; or

2. the decision is based on a wrong decision on a question
    of law; or

3. there was a miscarriage of justice.

[8]

The conclusion that it was premature to transfer the appellant to a less
    secure setting was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was open to the
    Board to accept the evidence favouring continued detention at Waypoint rather
    than the evidence of the treating physician advocating a transfer. There is no
    basis for this court to intervene. The appeal is dismissed.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: Sankar v. Bell Mobility Inc., 2016 ONCA 242

DATE: 20160404

DOCKET: C60176

Strathy C.J.O., LaForme and Huscroft JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Celia Sankar

Plaintiff (Appellant)

and

Bell Mobility Inc.

Defendant (Respondent)

Louis Sokolov, Jean-Marc Leclerc and Christine Davies,
    for the appellant

Steve Tenai and Guy White, for the respondent

Heard: November 23, 2015

On appeal from the judgment of Justice Edward P. Belobaba
    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 12, 2015, reported at 2015
    ONSC 632.

Strathy C.J.O.:

[1]

This appeal is about prepaid wireless phone card accounts. It concerns
    the fate of the balance remaining in a Bell Mobility Inc. (Bell) subscriberÂ’s
    account when she fails to Â“top upÂ” the account before the end of its Â“active
    periodÂ”.

[2]

BellÂ’s prepaid Â“top-upsÂ” allow customers to add credit to their accounts
    and extend their active periods that give them access to BellÂ’s wireless
    network. BellÂ’s practice, during the period at issue, was to claim unused funds
    the day after the end of the active period. For example, if the active period
    ended on June 30, BellÂ’s practice was to claim the unused funds on July 1, if the
    account had not been topped-up in order to extend the active period.

[3]

The appellantÂ’s certified class action alleges that Bell collected those
    funds improperly. She claims the contract provided that Bell had to wait until the
    second day after the end of the active period, not the first day. Alternatively,
    she alleges, Bell claimed funds improperly because Ontario legislation forbids
    the imposition of expiry dates on prepaid phone cards.

[4]

The motion judge ruled that Bell did not breach its contract and that
    the gift card regulations found in O. Reg. 17/05, as amended (the
Gift Card
    Regulation
)
[1]
,
    under the
Consumer Protection Act
,
2002
,
S.O. 2002, c.
    30 Sched. A, do not apply to prepaid phone cards. He therefore granted summary
    judgment answering the common issues in BellÂ’s favour and dismissed the class
    action.

[5]

The appellant challenges the motion judgeÂ’s conclusions on both issues.
    She asserts that the motion judge failed to consider the prepaid wireless
    contract as a whole, having regard to the expiry dates assigned by Bell and
    communicated to subscribers. She also submits that the motion judge erred in
    finding that the
Gift Card Regulation
is inapplicable to BellÂ’s phone
    cards.

[6]

For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.

A.

Breach of contract claim

[7]

Bell markets prepaid cell phone services under three brand names: Bell
    Mobility, Solo Mobile, and Virgin Mobile. As the motion judge noted, and here I
    borrow liberally from his reasons, Bell offered different active periods and
    pricing for its three brands. The active periods ranged from 30 to 365 days and
    the cost of credits that could be purchased ranged from $15 to $200, depending
    on the length of the active period. Generally, the longer the active period the
    more the card cost and the greater the credits that could be applied against
    particular Bell services during the active period. Thus, customers could choose
    a plan to suit their budgets and anticipated usage.

[8]

All plans had an active period. At the end of the active period access
    to BellÂ’s services terminated unless the plan was renewed. If not, the prepaid
    credits expired and were forfeited to Bell. If the customer Â“topped upÂ” the
    prepaid account balance before expiry, the unused balance was added to the new
    top-up and became subject to the new active period.

[9]

There were different ways to top up the account. Customers could pre-authorize
    the automatic top-up of their accounts through their credit or debit cards when
    the balance fell below a certain floor or was about to expire. Or, they could
    Â“manuallyÂ” top up with a credit card through the brandÂ’s web site or by
    purchasing a phone card from a retainer. Virgin Mobile customers could also
    Â“manuallyÂ” top up with a debit card. When customers topped up their accounts,
    they received a PIN (personal identification number) receipt, containing a
    unique code. When the customer wished to activate the top up, she could enter
    the code on the brandÂ’s website or by text or other communication to Bell, thereby
    adding the top up value to the balance in the prepaid account.

[10]

The
    focus of this action is the manual form of top up through the purchase of
    prepaid cards and PIN receipts.

[11]

The
    relevant portion of the Bell Mobility and Solo Mobile terms of service were as
    follows:

Value deposited into your prepaid account is available as
    prepaid credits for your Service and such credits are non-refundable,
    non-transferable, and will expire after a specified time period.

[12]

The
    Virgin Mobile terms of service stated the following:

All Top Ups ... have specified active periods and an expiry
    date. The active period starts on the date you place the Top Up on your
    account. Any Top Up balance on your account after the expiry date is forfeited
    and non-refundable. If you Top Up your account before your existing credit
    expires or is used up, then your existing credit is added to the new Top Up
    value and the active period of the earlier Top Up is extended so that the later
    expiry date of the two Top Ups is valid for the entire amount.

[13]

The
    motion judge relied on certain additional materials in his interpretation of
    the agreements.

[14]

First,
    as I have noted, the prepaid cards sold by retailers for these brands provided
    for different pricing and active periods. The cards used different terminology
    to describe the active period. Bell Mobility and Solo Mobile cards stated, for
    example, Â“$15 valid for 30 days.Â” Virgin Mobile cards said, for example, Â“Funds
    expire, $15 Â– 30 days after activation.Â”

[15]

Second,
    the PIN receipt customers received on payment for the card or top-up,
    stipulated, for example, Â“$15 valid 30 daysÂ” (Bell Mobility), Â“$20 Good for 45
    daysÂ” (Solo Mobile), and Â“Funds expire, $15 - 30 days after activationÂ” (Virgin
    Mobile).

[16]

The
    breach of contract claim boiled down to whether the prepaid card expired at the
    end of the last day of the active period, or the day after. If the card did not
    expire until the day after the end of the active period, then Bell had breached
    its contract by treating the purchaser as having forfeited the unused balance on
    that day. In my view, the motion judge correctly held that the card expired at
    the end of the last day of the active period, not on the day after. Bell was
    therefore entitled to collect the unused balance after the last day of the
    active period.

[17]

The
    motion judge found that, at the time of contracting, Bell intended, and
    subscribers understood, that the agreement would expire at the end of the
    relevant active period. They understood that any unused funds would be claimed
    by Bell after that time, unless the account was Â“topped upÂ” before expiry. The
    information on the prepaid cards and the PIN receipts was consistent with the
    language of the subscriber agreements, with brand brochures and pamphlets
    available at retailers and with the information on BellÂ’s websites.

[18]

While
    this matter was under reserve, this court released its decision in
MacDonald
    v. Chicago Title Insurance Company of Canada
, 2015 ONCA 842. The court held
    that the standard of review applicable to a standard form insurance policy was
    correctness. The appellant sought leave to make further submissions on the
    application of the decision and the court granted leave to both parties to do
    so.

[19]

Based
    on
Chicago Title
, the appellant submits that the standard of review is
    correctness, because BellÂ’s contracts are standard form contracts of adhesion. She
    submits that the factual matrix should have played no role in the
    interpretation of the contact. The motion judge should not have relied on
    extrinsic materials, such as PIN receipts, phone cards, brochures and websites
    to interpret the contract. Instead, the appellant says, the motion judge should
    have considered subsequent communications from Bell to its customers, in which Bell
    set out the expiry dates of their cards.

[20]

Bell,
    on the other hand, submits that the contract terms were contained not only in
    the agreements made when customers initially signed up for wireless service,
    but also in pricing and other contractual information, including expiry dates, set
    out in the prepaid cards and PIN receipts, which customers obtained when they
    bought top-ups. Bell says that the motion judge properly considered these
    documents, and others, in interpreting the contract. It also says that the
    motion judge rightly ignored communications made by Bell after customers had made
    their pre-payments.

[21]

Bell
    says that because the motion judge was entitled to rely on the factual matrix
    in this way, the standard of review should be one of palpable and overriding
    error.

[22]

In
    my view, in addition to the initial agreements, the motion judge was entitled
    to rely on other documents that formed part of the contractual relationship
    between the parties Â– the PIN receipts and phone cards referred to earlier. These,
    taken together with the agreements made when they subscribed to the service,
    formed the contract between every customer and Bell. It was appropriate to
    answer the common issue based on these documents and indeed the answer would
    have been incomplete had they not been considered.

[23]

There
    is a difference between considering the factual matrix and considering the
    documents that make up the contract itself. It is not uncommon in modern
    contracts, including contracts made partly on Â“paperÂ” and partly on the internet,
    for the contract terms to be found in several Â“documentsÂ”. And it is well-settled
    that where parties enter into interrelated agreements, the court is required to
    look to all those agreements to determine their construction.

[24]

Thus
    in
3869130 Canada Inc. v. I.C.B. Distribution Inc
., 2008 ONCA 396, this
    court stated that a court may have regard to the language of other contracts
    made at the same time. It quoted with approval from John D. McCamus, The Law of
    Contracts (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2005), at p. 715:

Many transactions, especially large commercial transactions
    such as the purchase and sale of a large and complex business, may involve the
    execution of several agreements. In such contexts, it is an interesting
    question, then, whether in the interpretation of one of the agreements, regard
    may be had to the others.
The basic principle is that such regard may be had
    only where the agreements essentially form components of one larger
    transaction. Where each agreement is entered into on the faith of the others
    being executed and where it is intended that each agreement form part of a
    larger composite whole, assistance in the interpretation of any particular
    agreement may be drawn from the related agreements.
[Emphasis added.
    Citation omitted.]

[25]

In
    this case, the agreements were not contemporaneous, but they were interrelated.
    The initial agreement contemplated that customers would top up their accounts
    through BellÂ’s websites, through the purchase of phone cards and through the
    purchase of PIN receipts. These were not simply part of the factual matrix Â– they
    contained contractual terms themselves. The motion judge properly had regard to
    these documents in order to determine the contract terms. Because these terms
    were common to all class members (albeit in slightly different language
    depending on the manner of top-up), it was appropriate to address the issue as
    a common issue.

[26]

In
    my view, based on
Sattva
and
Chicago Title
, a correctness
    standard applies to the interpretation of the Bell contracts, which included
    standard terms of service and standard form phone cards and PIN receipts. The
    factual matrix applicable to the dealings between individual customers and Bell
    plays no role in the interpretation of the contracts. Indeed, if that did play
    any role, the interpretation of the contract would not be a suitable common
    issue, because the answer could vary depending on the underlying facts.

[27]

The
    appellant says that the motion judge should have considered the text messages
    and other communications made by Bell to its customers prior to the expiry of
    their top-ups to notify them that their funds were about to expire. But these
    communications took place after the contract had been made. As the motion judge
    properly found, at para 28:

If any class member misunderstood the follow-up
    "expiration date" messages as meaning that unused funds would expire
    on Day 31 and would be seized on Day 32, and she relied on said messages to her
    detriment (by not topping up in time and forfeiting the unused balance) and the
    defendant did not grant a courtesy extension, then her remedy, as already
    noted, was two-fold: either a claim in breach of contract arguing promissory
    estoppel or a claim in misrepresentation. But both of these remedies would
    require proof of individual reliance and neither would be amenable to a class
    proceeding. That is why, as I have already noted, neither promissory estoppel
    nor misrepresentation was alleged by the plaintiff or pursued herein.

[28]

These
    communications were not part of the factual matrix surrounding the formation of
    the contract. At their highest, they were post-contractual representations.

[29]

In
    my view, the motion judgeÂ’s interpretation of the contract was correct. It was
    based on BellÂ’s Terms and Conditions of Service and other documents available
    at the time of contracting and the ordinary, grammatical and common sense
    meaning of the contract language.

[30]

The
    plain meaning of the language on the prepaid cards and the PIN receipts, when
    read in context of the agreements made by customers when they initially subscribed
    for the service, was, as the motion judge found, that the subscriberÂ’s ability
    to use the prepaid funds expired at the end of the relevant active period.

[31]

Indeed,
    the appellantÂ’s complaint to the CRTC confirmed that she understood from the
    contract documents that her account would expire at the end of the relevant
    period if it was not topped-up.

[32]

As
    the motion judge noted, the appellantÂ’s real complaint, and the real complaint
    in this class action, is that BellÂ’s
subsequent
communications to its customers Â– made after they had purchased their top-ups
    and as the top-up was about to expire Â– were misleading. That is because they
    may have created the impression that subscribers had an additional day after
    the end of the active period to Â“top upÂ” before their funds expired. I agree
    with the motion judge that this was essentially a claim for misrepresentation
    or promissory estoppel, neither of which was before him, because neither was held
    to be amenable to resolution as a common issue in the class proceeding.

[33]

I
    would therefore dismiss the first ground of appeal.

B.

Gift Card Regulation

[34]

The
    parties made no submissions in either this court or in the court below
    concerning the legislative jurisdiction of the Province of Ontario over prepaid
    phone cards. The appellant submits that if Ontario has such jurisdiction, an
    issue that was left for another day if necessary, the cards cannot have expiry
    dates. She submits the motion judge erred in his interpretation and application
    of ss. 23 and 25.1-5 of the
Gift Card Regulation
.

[35]

The
Gift Card Regulation
is made under the
Consumer Protection Act.
Part
    IV of that statute deals with specific consumer agreements, including Â“future
    performance agreements.Â” A future performance agreement is defined in s. 1 as a
    Â“consumer agreement in respect of which delivery, performance or payment in
    full is not made when the parties enter the agreementÂ”. That is, as the name
    suggests, an agreement that is to be wholly or partly performed in the future.
    Sections 21 to 26 of the statute set out certain consumer rights in relation to
    future performance agreements, none of which is applicable here.

[36]

The
Gift Card Regulation
states the requirements for future performance
    agreements generally and for Â“gift card agreementsÂ” in particular. The regulation
    defines both Â“gift cardÂ” and Â“gift card agreementÂ” as follows:

23.

In the Act and this Part,

Â“gift cardÂ” means a voucher in any form, including an
    electronic credit or written certificate, that is issued by a supplier under a
    gift card agreement and that the holder is entitled to apply towards purchasing
    goods or services covered by the voucher; (Â“carte cadeauÂ”)

Â“gift card agreementÂ” means a future performance agreement
    under which the supplier issues a gift card to the consumer and in respect of
    which the consumer makes payment in full when entering into the agreement;
    (Â“convention de carte cadeauÂ”)

[37]

As
    the motion judge noted, there is a degree of circularity to these definitions,
    in that each term is defined partly by reference to itself.

[38]

The
    regulation prohibits an expiry date on the future performance of a gift card
    agreement:

25.3(1)

No supplier shall enter into a gift card
    agreement that has an expiry date on the future performance of the agreement.

25.3(2)

A gift card agreement with an expiry date on its
    future performance shall be effective as if it had no expiry date if the
    agreement is otherwise valid.

[39]

Based
    on the ordinary meaning of the terms Â“gift cardÂ” and Â“gift card agreement,Â” the
    motion judge interpreted those terms as requiring an actual gifting of the card
    or voucher to a third party. In reaching this conclusion, he held that Â“[t]here
    is nothing in the language of the
Gift Card Regulation
that explicitly
    limits or confines its application to gift cards as commonly understood.Â” He
    noted, however, that in introducing the regulation, the Minister of Government
    Services observed that gifts cards Â“are purchased in good faith by the people
    of Ontario for their family and friends.Â”

[40]

He
    concluded that prepaid phone cards are generally not subject to the
Gift
    Card Regulation
, because they are purchased for personal use and not as
    gifts. In his view, only if a prepaid phone card was Â“
purchased
    as a gift for a third party, [would it] qualify as a Â‘gift cardÂ’Â”.

[41]

He held that even phone cards and PIN receipts purchased as gifts
    for third parties would not contravene the regulation, because they did not
    have expiry dates. He stated, at para. 44:

They could be redeemed, i.e. activated, at any time without
    limitation. Â… And the fact that the wireless services provided thereafter were
    time limited, i.e. after this particular gift card was redeemed (by
    activation), is not a breach of any provision in the
Gift Card Regulation
.

[42]

The
    motion judge held, in the alternative, that even if pre-paid phone cards were
    Â“gift cardsÂ”, they were nonetheless exempted under s. 25.1(b) of the
Gift
    Card Regulation
, which exempts any Â“gift card that covers only one specific
    good or serviceÂ” from the no expiry date provision, among others. The gift
    cards here, he said, covered only one specific service: access to BellÂ’s
    network.

[43]

The
    appellant argues that there is nothing in the legislation to show that it was
    limited to future performance agreements purchased as gifts. She also says the
    Bell cards are not for one specific service, but rather for a variety of
    services, including voice, data, voicemail, call display, long distance,
    roaming, text, picture, downloads, streaming, browser usage and internet
    access. These services are priced at specific rates, which are then deducted
    from the consumerÂ’s account based on usage of each service.

[44]

The
    respondent agrees with the motion judge and argues that access to the network
    is a single service; all the other services are incidental.

[45]

I
    do not find it necessary to address the issue of whether the
Gift Card
    Regulation
applies only to gift cards purchased as gifts. Nor is it
    necessary to consider whether the case falls within the single service
    exception, although there is a strong argument that the consumer is purchasing
    a single service Â– access to BellÂ’s network for a defined period of time.

[46]

Rather,
    I rest my conclusion on the interpretation of the
Gift Card Regulation
,
    to which the motion judge alluded in his analysis. The regulation prohibits an
    expiry date on the Â“
future performance of the agreement
Â”. It provides
    that a future performance agreement with an expiry date is to be effective Â“as
    if it had no expiry dateÂ”. Its purpose is to prevent the expiry of the
    agreement before the seller of the card has delivered the goods or performed
    the services promised under the agreement. It does
not
prohibit an
    agreement being time-limited Â– for example, use of a gym for 30 days after
    activation of the membership, or use of wireless services for 30, 60, 90 or 365
    days after activation.

[47]

The
    question, therefore, is Â“what does performance of the wireless agreement
    entail?Â” Does it mean that Bell performs its agreement by giving the customer
    access to its wireless network for 30, 60, 90 or 365 days, or does it mean that
    Bell must provide wireless service until the customer uses up all the prepaid
    credits in his or her account?

[48]

The
    plain meaning of the contracts is that customers were buying a defined period
    of wireless service. Significantly, the motion judge found, at para. 12, that Â“[a]t
    no time during the class period did class members receive anything less than
    the full period of wireless service for which they had contracted to receive.Â”

[49]

But,
    although the performance of the contract entailed a defined period, the
    purchaser or donee of a Bell card or PIN receipt could decide when she wanted
    to activate the service in order to begin that period. The service could be
    activated at any time in the future. Bell was required to perform the agreement
    once the consumer decided to activate the service. The agreement was fully performed
    by Bell when it gave the customer access to its wireless services for the
    agreed-on period.

[50]

The
    fact that the service purchased was for a defined period, calculated on the dollar
    value of credits the consumer added to the account, was not a breach of the
    regulation. To hold otherwise would mean that Bell was required to keep the
    wireless service and number available to the customer indefinitely, a patently
    unreasonable outcome. As the motion judge noted, at para. 44 of his reasons,
    Â“section 25.3(1) [of the
Gift Card Regulation
] prohibits an expiry date
    on the gift card itself and not on the goods or services purchased with that
    gift card.Â”

[51]

It
    is noteworthy, although not in any way determinative, that in establishing the
Wireless
    Code
, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
    specifically addressed this issue, after hearing submissions from consumer
    groups and wireless providers:
Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2013-271
.
    The
Wireless Code
, effective December 2, 2013, established a mandatory
    code of conduct for all providers of retail mobile wireless voice and data
    services. The CRTC noted that prepaid cards are subject to an expiry date
    ranging from 15 days to one year after activation, depending on the value of
    the card, and to continue service and/or carry over credits beyond the expiry
    date consumers can Â“top upÂ” their accounts via the service providerÂ’s website and/or
    by purchasing additional prepaid cards.

[52]

The
    CRTC received complaints similar to those made by the representative plaintiff
    in this proceeding. Indeed, she herself made a complaint to the CRTC. She and
    other consumers were frustrated that their account balances expired if they did
    not Â“top upÂ” and that they lost the balance in the account if they missed the
    end of their active period, by even one day. They asked the CRTC to require
    wireless service providers to carry over prepaid account balances indefinitely
    or to prohibit the expiry of prepaid cards.

[53]

To
    address these concerns, the CRTC required wireless service providers to hold
    prepaid card customersÂ’ accounts open for seven days following expiry of an
    activation period to give consumers additional time to Â“top upÂ” their accounts.
    This, it said, would not impose significant burdens on service providers, would
    enhance the clarity of prepaid billing services and policies, would balance
    consumer interests with Â“current market realitiesÂ” and would increase
    flexibility for frequent users of prepaid services.

[54]

The
    commission concluded, however, that it would not be appropriate to require
    service providers to permit consumers to carry over their prepaid unused
    minutes indefinitely. It noted that prepaid card services provide access to the
    network for a specific period of time. It stated, at para. 349 of its decision:

The Commission considers that the evidence on the record of the
    proceeding does not support consumersÂ’ request for [wireless service providers]
    to carry over their prepaid unused minutes indefinitely. In this regard, the
    Commission notes that wireless services, including prepaid card services,
    provide access to the network for a specific period of time with specific usage
    limitations that are distinct for each aspect of the service. The Commission considers
    that imposing a requirement that services be provided beyond the limitations
    set out in the service agreement would not be appropriate.

[55]

As
    the motion judge noted, in November 2013 Bell amended its top-up agreements to
    reflect the seven-day grace period conferred by the CRTCÂ’s decision.

[56]

It
    is true that this conclusion means that consumers, such as the appellant, may
    find themselves in a situation where their phone cards expire before they have
    had a chance to use all their prepaid credits. They may also find themselves on
    a merry-go-round they cannot get off, because they must constantly top up an
    account with a credit balance, because they have not used up all their credits
    from the previous active period. Depending on oneÂ’s perspective, that may be
    unfair or it may be part of the price paid for the flexibility of a prepaid
    phone card. The CRTC does not address this issue. If the Province of Ontario
    has jurisdiction over phone cards Â– an open question Â– it may choose to do so.

[57]

In
    my view, the motion judge was correct to grant summary judgment in favour of
    the respondent on the common issue relating to the
Gift Card Regulation.

C.

Disposition

[58]

For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

[59]

The
    parties agreed that costs should be awarded to the successful party in the
    amount of $20,000 all-inclusive, subject to the right of the Class Proceedings
    Fund to make submissions. A copy of these reasons shall be provided to the Fund
    by class counsel. Subject to any submissions by the Fund within 30 days, the
    respondent shall have its costs in the agreed amount.

Â“I agree Grant Huscroft
    J.A.Â”

Released: April 4, 2016

I will refer to this regulation as the
Gift Card Regulation
although it covers more than this subject. The same term was used in the
    certified common issue.

COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

CITATION: Spar Roofing &amp; Metal Supplies Limited v. Glynn,
    2016 ONCA 296

DATE: 20160425

DOCKET: C60682

Weiler, Hourigan and Huscroft JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Spar Roofing &amp; Metal Supplies Limited, Craig
    Glynn and Wendy Glynn

Plaintiffs (Appellants)

and

Grant Richard Glynn

Defendant (Respondent)

Lorne S. Silver, for the appellants

C. David Freedman and Suzana Popovic-Montag, for the
    respondent

Heard: March 29, 2016

On appeal from the judgment of Justice Kevin W. Whitaker
    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 11, 2015.

Weiler J.A.:

A.

Overview

[1]

This is a family dispute in which the appellants, Craig and Wendy Glynn,
    seek to set aside a transfer of real property (the Property) to their brother,
    the respondent Grant Glynn. The transfer resulted in Grant becoming a joint
    tenant with his parents, Edward and Wanda Glynn, and was a gift from them.

[2]

Craig and Wendy allege that Edward, with the concurrence of Wanda, promised
    the Property to them. They allege that Edward promised them the Property would
    form part of the corporate assets of Spar Roofing &amp; Metal Supplies Limited,
    a company founded by Edward and now operated by Craig and Wendy in which they
    own all of the common shares. The Property serves as the main roadway access
    and exit to Spar RoofingÂ’s business and is used as a warehouse. It is located
    in Toronto and is worth in excess of two million dollars.

[3]

The motion judge characterized the appellantsÂ’ pleading as seeking to
    enforce EdwardÂ’s promise to gift the Property to Craig and Wendy in the future
    and struck the appellantsÂ’ claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
    He further held that the appellants lacked standing to Â“bring a claim to divest
    the defendant of his interests in the property.Â”

[4]

A preliminary issue on this appeal is whether the motion judgeÂ’s reasons
    are so deficient, due to contradictory and conclusory statements, that they are
    incapable of appellate review. If the reasons are sufficient, the issues are
    whether the motion judge erred in striking the appellantsÂ’ claim without leave
    to amend and whether the appellants ought to be granted leave to amend their
    pleading.

[5]

For the reasons that follow I would hold that the motion judgeÂ’s reasons
    are sufficient because they explain the basis for his conclusion. While he did
    not err in characterizing the claim as being about a promise to make a gift of
    land, I would hold that he erred in dismissing the claim without granting the
    appellants leave to amend their pleading. Accordingly, I would grant the
    appellants leave to amend.

B.

The Facts Alleged

[6]

The facts as pleaded are summarized below.

[7]

On or about August 1994, Edward, as landlord, and Spar Roofing, as
    tenant, entered into a 30-year lease of the Property at the same fixed-rate
    rent for the entire lease period. The lease was signed by Craig on behalf of
    Spar Roofing and registered on title. Edward assured Craig and Wendy that the
    lease was a means of Â‘guaranteeingÂ’ that the Property would form part of the
    company assets. Grant understood that the Property would be included in the
    company assets.

[8]

On December 19, 2003, Edward and Wanda entered into a letter agreement
    with Craig and Wendy to govern share ownership in Spar Roofing. The agreement
    provided that all of the common shares were owned by Craig and Wendy and that
    upon the deaths of Edward and Wanda, the Class A and Class B shares would also
    be assigned to Craig and Wendy with the result that they would become the sole
    shareholders of the company.

[9]

Edward promised Craig and Wendy on many occasions that his estate would
    be split between his personal assets and the assets related to the company.
    Upon his death the company assets would vest with Craig and Wendy or the
    company. Edward also represented and assured Craig and Wendy that Wanda was in
    agreement with this arrangement.

[10]

EdwardÂ’s mental health began to deteriorate in the early 2000s, when he
    started suffering from dementia/AlzheimerÂ’s and ParkinsonÂ’s disease. He was
    permanently hospitalized for dementia on or about February 22, 2011. Wanda was
    also hospitalized for various physical and mental health issues around the same
    time.

[11]

Both parents became mentally incompetent and were unable to manage their
    personal and financial affairs.
[1]
On or about February 2011, Grant assumed control over his parentsÂ’ affairs and
    refused to discuss them with Craig or Wendy.

The
    statement of defence pleads that when Edward and Wanda made their 2009 wills
    leaving the Property to Grant, they also made powers of attorney for property
    and personal care, appointing the other as attorney with Grant as the
    substitute or alternate attorney.

[12]

In May 2012, Grant arranged for a transfer agreement whereby the
    Property was transferred to him as a joint tenant with Edward and Wanda. He
    arranged for a solicitor to sign the agreement on behalf of his parents and
    register it. The statement of defence pleads that Edward and Wanda personally
    signed a direction and authorization for the lawyer to proceed with the
    transfer.

[13]

The Property transfer shows the Property being given to Grant as a gift.

[14]

Craig and Wendy did not learn about the transfer until August 2012, when
    they discovered GrantÂ’s name on a tax bill for the Property.

[15]

Craig and Wendy alleged in the statement of claim that in arranging for
    the transfer of the Property to him as a joint tenant, Grant exercised undue
    influence over Edward and Wanda when they were suffering from mental illness
    and that they did not receive independent legal advice prior to entering into the
    transfer. They further alleged that Grant was in a fiduciary relationship with
    Edward and Wanda, and that he received a benefit from the transfer to the
    detriment of Edward, Wanda, Craig and Wendy. Alternatively, or in addition,
    Craig and Wendy alleged that the transfer was void because Edward and Wanda
    lacked mental capacity to enter into the transfer.

[16]

Craig and Wendy also alleged that Grant was aware that Â“it was always
    EdwardÂ’s intention to gift the Company Assets (including the Property) to Craig
    and Wendy or the Company upon his deathÂ” and that GrantÂ’s conduct deprived them
    of an asset to which they are lawfully entitled.

[17]

Since EdwardÂ’s death on February 1, 2014, Grant has rejected every
    request to inform Craig and Wendy of his alleged status as executor of EdwardÂ’s
    estate and attorney over WandaÂ’s property and care.

C.

The Motion JudgeÂ’s Reasons

[18]

The core of the motion judgeÂ’s decision is found at paras. 7, 9, 10 and
    11 of his reasons:

[7]Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiffs plead that the property was the subject
    of oral promises made by Edward to Craig and Wendy, and that the property would
    be transferred to them as part of his estate plan. This statement of claim does
    not plead consideration being provided to Edward and/or Wanda, nor terms by
    which it could be said that title to the property was to be transferred [to]
    Spar. The plaintiffs agree that Grant was added to title as a joint tenant by
    Edward and Wanda on the transfer date.



[9]Â Â Â Â Â  A gift is not a fulfillment of an obligation. A donor
    may simply never make the gift if he or she does not wish to do so even if a
    promise was made. The plaintiffs do not plead any agreement existing between
    the defendant and them. The plaintiffs cannot sue for a third party and lack
    standing to set aside the gift to Grant.

[10]Â Â Â  It is undisputed that the joint tenants prior to the
    transfer were Edward and Wanda. The plaintiffs have no financial interest or
    legal entitlement to the property.

[11]Â Â Â  The oral promise to gift is not enforceable as a matter
    of law. The plaintiffs have no standing to bring a claim to divest the
    defendant of his interests in the property. The plaintiffsÂ’ claims cannot be
    the basis for the relief which the [plaintiffs] seeks.

[19]

The motion judge observed, at para. 13 of his reasons, that it was
    premature for Grant to rely on the
Statute of Frauds
, R.S.O. 1990,
    c.Â S.19, as a basis for striking out the appellantsÂ’ claim, as this was a
    defence that they need not anticipate. The motion judge further noted that
    whether there was sufficient evidence of past conduct as part performance (that
    the appellants wished to put forward by way of reply) to bring the matter
    within an exception to the
Statute of Frauds
was a matter to be
    determined at trial and not at the pleading stage. In so observing, the motion
    judge relied on
Collins v. Cortez
,

2014 ONCA 685, 39 C.C.L.I.
    (5th) 1, at para. 10, and
Mountain v. Mountain Estate
, 2012 ONCA 806,
    112 O.R. (3d) 721. The motion judge also noted that the presumption of WandaÂ’s
    capacity is a matter of defence and that the appellants should not plead the
    manner by which they have proof of her incapacity.

[20]

At para. 15 of his reasons, however, the motion judge stated:

On these facts, it cannot be said that it is plain and obvious
    that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. In the
    alternative and in the event that the statement of claim may be deficient, the
    appropriate remedy is the extension of time within which to deliver a reply.

[21]

At para. 16 of his reasons, the motion judge simply stated that GrantÂ’s
    motion to strike was allowed.

Discussion and Analysis

(1)

Are the motion judgeÂ’s reasons sufficient to permit appellate review?

[22]

A judgeÂ’s reasons must be read as a whole. An appellate court cannot
    intervene simply because it believes the judge did a poor job of expressing
    himself. A failure to give adequate reasons is not a free standing basis for
    appeal:
F.H. v. McDougall
,

2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41,
    at para.Â 99. The duty to give reasons should be given a functional and
    purposeful interpretation. If the reasons explain the basis for the decision
    reached and why the judge arrived at his or her conclusions, they will be
    sufficient:
D.M. Drugs (Harris Guardian Drugs) v. Barry Edward Bywater
    (Parkview Hotel)
,

2013 ONCA 356, 307 O.A.C. 71, at paras. 36-37.

[23]

The appellants submit that the reasons of the motion judge are
    contradictory, confusing and conclusory, fail to provide an explanation for the
    ultimate disposition and fail to provide reasons for denying the appellantsÂ’
    request to file a reply to the effect that the requirements of the
Statute
    of Frauds
have been met.

[24]

I read the reasons of the motion judge as in effect saying the
    following:

Â·

The
    claim alleges an oral promise by Edward and Wanda to transfer the Property to
    Spar Roofing and thus to Craig and Wendy, who would ultimately be the sole
    shareholders of Spar Roofing. No consideration is pleaded for this promise. A
    promise to make a gift without more is unenforceable at law. [While the
    pleading alleges that Grant was aware of the promise made by Edward and Wanda
    to the plaintiffs] it does not allege any agreement with Grant.

Â·

Although
    Grant relied on the
Statute of Frauds
as a basis for striking the
    statement of claim, this was a defence that the appellants need not have
    anticipated and could have been dealt with by way of reply. The sufficiency of
    past conduct as performance is a matter for trial. Compliance with the
Statute
    of Frauds
was not a basis on which to dismiss the claim at the pleading
    stage. It was thus unnecessary to grant the plaintiffs request for an
    adjournment to file a reply.

Â·

It
    could not be said that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of
    action [given the allegations of mental incapacity on the part of Edward and
    Wanda to make the transfer and the allegations of undue influence and breach of
    fiduciary duty against Grant]. The appropriate remedy for a deficiency in
    pleading was an extension of time.

Â·

[EdwardÂ’s
    estate trustee and Wanda do not attack the transfer.] The plaintiffs cannot sue
    Grant for the benefit of/on behalf of a third party. The plaintiffs have no
    financial interest or legal entitlement to the Property. Thus, the plaintiffs
    lack standing to attack the transfer of the Property to Grant.

Â·

GrantÂ’s
    motion to strike should be allowed.

[25]

While the reasons are not easy to understand, reading them as a whole
    and giving them a functional and purposeful interpretation, they explain the
    basis for the motion judgeÂ’s decision to strike the pleading, why he refused to
    grant an adjournment to file a reply and how he arrived at his conclusion.

[26]

This ground of appeal is dismissed.

(2)

Did the motion judge err in characterizing the claim as a being about a
    promise to gift the Property?

[27]

The appellantsÂ’ primary position is that the motion judge erred in
    characterizing EdwardÂ’s promise as a gift. They submit that the motion judgeÂ’s
    characterization of the pleading as being about a gift is a false premise upon
    which he based his decision. They submit that what was pleaded was an agreement
    to convey property and the motion judge therefore erred. They submit that the
    long-term lease with no provision for rent increase is part performance of the
    agreement, and that the omission to specifically plead part performance of the
    agreement or to plead consideration could have been corrected by an amendment
    to the pleading.

[28]

The appellants further argue that, pursuant to the agreement to convey
    the Property, they had an equitable interest in the Property and standing to
    challenge the transfer to Grant. The motion judgeÂ’s conclusion, at para. 10 of
    his reasons, that, Â“The plaintiffs have no financial interest or legal
    entitlement to the propertyÂ” is based therefore on the incorrect conclusion
    that what was pled was a gift, and if there was an agreement to transfer the Property,
    the motion judgeÂ’s holding that the pleading seeks to enforce a promise to make
    a gift is not available. The appellants submit that the pleading alleges an
    agreement that Grant took steps to frustrate through the exercise of undue
    influence over his parents, or in breach of his fiduciary duty when he was
    controlling his parentsÂ’ affairs, and that the court should give effect to the
    pleading that Wanda lacks capacity.

[29]

The appellantsÂ’ forceful argument ignores, however, para. 25 of the
    pleading which states: Â“As Grant was aware, it was always EdwardÂ’s intention to
gift
the Company Assets (including the Property)
    to Craig and Wendy or the Company upon his deathÂ” (emphasis added).

[30]

The pleading as a whole is consistent with the characterization of the
    arrangement as a promised gift rather than as an agreement to convey. The
    letter agreement pleaded in para. 10 does not deal with the Property; it deals
    only with share ownership in Spar Roofing. Paragraph 11 pleads that Edward
    promised Craig and Wendy that his estate would be split between his personal assets
    and the assets related to the company with the company assets vesting in Craig
    and Wendy or the company and that Wanda agreed with this arrangement. Paragraph
    13 pleads that the Property would form part of the company assets. Paragraph 14
    pleads the existence of the lease agreement. While it is submitted that
    pleading the lease agreement is pleading part performance of a contract, the
    pleading is equally consistent with the favorable terms of the lease agreement
    being a gift.

[31]

The pleading does not allege an agreement to convey the Property in
    exchange for services performed or money spent; it does not allege any acts
    done in reliance on a promise to convey. Overall, the pleading does not allege
    that Edward and Wanda breached any alleged agreement and Wanda has not been
    sued. Inasmuch as no agreement is pleaded, the pleading does not specifically
    allege that Grant induced the breach of this agreement.

[32]

The relief sought in the statement of claim is simply that the transfer
    be set aside and an injunction issued against Grant as well as permission to
    file a statement of pending litigation. A declaration of entitlement to the Property
    is not sought as part of the relief requested by the appellants.

[33]

The motion judge was of the opinion that the issue of the
Statute of
    Frauds
was a matter to be dealt with at trial. At the same time, he
    dismissed the claim. It does not appear that he considered whether an
    adjournment to permit a reply might affect his decision on the claimÂ’s
    viability. What exactly was argued in support of the request for an adjournment
    to file a reply is unclear.

[34]

The motion judge did not err in his characterization of the appellantsÂ’
    claim as a promise to make a gift. On the basis of the material before him, it
    appeared to be obvious that the appellants lacked standing to have Grant
    account for the transfer of an interest in the Property to him.

(3)

Did the motion judge err in not granting leave to amend?

[35]

Rule 26.01 of the
Rules of Civil Procedure
, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    194, provides that Â“at any stage of an action the court shall grant leave to
    amend a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that
    could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.Â” The words Â“at any
    stageÂ” include the appeal: see e.g.
Conway v. Law Society of Upper Canada
,
    2016 ONCA 72.

[36]

The rule is designed to carry out the underlying principles reflected in
    the
Courts of Justice Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, of encouraging public
    access to the courts (s. 71) and affirming the role of the Superior Court as a court
    of equity (s.Â 96) where actions are decided on their merits. Another
    purpose is to bring all parties to disputes relating to one subject matter
    before the court at the same time so that disputes might be determined without
    the delay, inconvenience and expense of separate actions. The object of the
    rule requiring the court to grant leave to amend is not that the partyÂ’s case
    should be so framed as to succeed but that it be framed so that it can be
    adjudicated by the court, whether for or against the party.

[37]

As far back as 1883, Lord Brett M.R. laid down this rule regarding the
    amendment of pleadings in
Clarapede v. Commercial Union Assn.
(1883),
    32 W.R. 262; it was restated by Lord Esher M.R. in
Steward v. North
    Metropolitan Tramways Co.
(1886), 16 Q.B.D. 556, 55 L.J.Q.B. 157 (C.A.),
    as follows:

The rule of conduct of the Court in such a case is that,
    however negligent or careless may have been the first omission, and however
    late the proposed amendment, the amendment should be allowed, if it can be made
    without injustice to the other side. There is no injustice if the other side
    can be compensated by costs: but, if the amendment will put them into such a
    position that they must be injured, it ought not to be made.

This rule was adopted in Ontario in
Williams v.
    Leonard
(1895), 16 P.R. 544, at p.Â 549 (Ont. H.C.), affÂ’d (1896), 17
    P.R. 73 (Ont. C.A.), affÂ’d (1896), 26 S.C.R. 406. This court has recently
    affirmed the principle that amendments should be allowed absent non-compensable
    prejudice and noted additional factors to guide the application of r. 26.01:
    see
Marks v. Ottawa
, 2011 ONCA 248, 280 O.A.C. 251, at para. 19;
1317424
    Ontario Inc. v. Chrysler Canada Inc.
, 2015 ONCA 104, 330 O.A.C. 195, at
    para. 7.

[38]

Although the appellants did not make a specific request to amend the
    claim, their request for an adjournment of the motion to file a reply was in
    effect a request to amend. As indicated, the motion judge was of the opinion
    that an adjournment to file a reply respecting the
Statute of Frauds
was unnecessary. However, when he dismissed the entire claim, r.Â 26.01
    required the motion judge to consider whether leave to amend should be granted
    and, if he determined that it should not, to provide reasons responsive to the
    grounds for refusing leave identified in the jurisprudence, unless his reasons
    for not granting leave were obvious or could be inferred.

[39]

No draft amended statement of claim has been proffered on appeal in
    support of the request for leave to amend. Based on the oral argument on appeal,
    the proposed amendment would allege an agreement wherein Edward, with WandaÂ’s
    concurrence, promised to convey the Property to Craig and Wendy or to Spar in
    exchange for the performance of services and money expended on the Property.
    The agreement was to be fulfilled upon EdwardÂ’s death or at the latest when
    Wanda died. The theory of the case would be that Edward and Wanda were not able
    to convey an interest in the Property to Grant as a joint tenant because at the
    time of the transfer the appellants already had an equitable interest in the Property.
    In addition to requesting that the transfer be set aside, the prayer for relief
    would need to be amended to request a declaration that the appellants held an
    equitable interest in the Property at the time of the transfer to Grant. The
    pleading would also allege that Grant prevented the agreement from being
    fulfilled by having an interest in the Property transferred to himself as joint
    tenant.

[40]

The proposed amendment seeks to plead an additional legal theory which
    flows partly from the facts already pleaded and partly from additional facts
    that the appellants wish to plead. The purpose of the amended claim would be to
    obviate the question of standing at the pleading stage and to avoid a later
    argument that the legal theories and consequences flowing from the facts as
    proven were not pleaded.

[41]

The respondent submits that an oral promise to gift land is simply
    unenforceable as a matter of established law and, as a result, the motion judge
    did not err in striking the claim. He further submits that, as pleaded, the
    motion judge did not err in holding that the appellants lack standing to bring
    their action. I acknowledge the strength of these submissions but they do not
    answer the question of whether leave to amend should now be granted.

[42]

On the issue of whether leave to amend should be granted, the respondent
    renews his argument that the appellantsÂ’ proposed amendment is unenforceable
    because they cannot bring themselves within the exception to the
Statute of
    Frauds
. The respondent further submits that the appellants have
    misapprehended the equitable doctrine of part performance of an agreement in
    relation to land that would otherwise be unenforceable because it is not in
    writing. He submits that the appellants must plead acts done in reliance of
    such magnitude that it would be inequitable and unconscionable to deny them
    relief. He points out that the law requires that the acts put forward as part
    performance refer to the alleged contract dealing with the land, and refers to
Steinberg
    v. King
,

2011 ONSC 3042, and
Cowderoy v. Sorkos Estate
,

2012 ONSC 1921, 23 R.P.R. (5th) 36, in support of this argument.

[43]

The respondentÂ’s submission is in effect a submission that the court
    should consider the merits of the factual and legal basis for the proposed
    amendment at the pleading stage and not at a later stage of the proceedings.
    That is not the law under r. 26.01. As stated in Todd Archibald, Gordon Killeen
    &amp; James C. Morton,
Ontario Superior Court Practice, 2016 Edition
(Markham, ON: LexisNexis Canada, 2015), at p. 1151:

The amended pleading must be legally tenable. It is not
    necessary to tender evidence to support the claims nor is it necessary for the
    court to consider whether the amending party is able to prove its amended claim.
    The court must assume that the facts pleaded in the proposed amendment (unless
    patently ridiculous or incapable of proof) are true, and the only question is
    whether they disclose a cause of action. Amendments are to be granted unless
    the claim is clearly impossible of success.

Put another way, an amendment is to be granted unless
    it would have been struck out under r. 21.01(1)(b) if it had been pleaded
    originally:
1317424 Ontario Inc.
, at para. 7. A motion to strike out a
    pleading on the ground it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence
    must not, however, be conflated with a motion for summary judgment under r.
    20.04: see
Andersen Consulting v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2001),
    150 O.A.C. 177 (C.A.), at paras. 34-37;
Griffiths v. Canaccord Capital
    Corp.
(2005), 204 O.A.C. 224 (Div. Ct.), at para. 10.

[44]

The proposed amendment to the pleading discloses a cause of action. That
    question is whether an alleged oral agreement made between the appellants and
    Edward and Wanda should be enforced against Grant notwithstanding the
    requirements of the
Statute of Frauds
and notwithstanding the lack of
    privity of contract between the appellants and him. While difficult to prove,
    it cannot be said that the proposed amendment is incapable of proof.

[45]

In my view, given that the respondent does not allege prejudice that
    cannot be compensated for in costs, the appellants must be given leave to amend
    their pleading.

(4)

Do the plaintiffs have standing to question the transfer of the Property
    to Grant on the basis of alleged undue influence and breach of fiduciary duty?

[46]

An alternative ground of appeal is whether, apart from any alleged
    agreement to convey, the appellants have standing to seek to set aside the
    transfer to Grant. The pleading alleges that Grant took advantage of Edward and
    Wanda when they were suffering from mental illness. The appellants further
    plead, in para. 23 of their claim, that they are entitled to have the transfer
    set aside because of undue influence by Grant on Edward and Wanda; that Grant
    was in a fiduciary relationship with Edward and Wanda as the manager of their
    financial affairs; and, that Grant received a benefit from the Property
    transfer that was to the detriment of Edward, Wanda, Craig and Wendy and in
    breach of GrantÂ’s fiduciary duty to Edward and Wanda.

[47]

In addition, the appellants plead that Grant assumed control over his
    parentsÂ’ affairs and that since EdwardÂ’s passing on February 1, 2014, Grant has
    rejected every request to inform his siblings respecting his alleged status as
    executor of EdwardÂ’s estate and attorney over WandaÂ’s property and care. Thus,
    the pleading alleges that in respect of Edward, the attorney (while Edward was
    alive) and estate trustee (now that Edward is deceased) are one and the same
    person, namely Grant. I read the claim as requiring Grant to account for his
    actions respecting the Property and to justify his actions as being beneficial
    to the donees of the power of attorney, failing which, the transfer should be
    set aside. The appellants also allege that Edward and Wanda lacked the mental
    capacity to manage their affairs at the time they gave a direction to the
    lawyer who carried out the transfer.

[48]

The motion judge recognized this pleading constituted a valid cause of
    action, but because he was of the view that the appellants lacked any financial
    or other interest in the Property, he held they had no standing to challenge
    the transfer to Grant as a joint tenant. The appellants submit that on the
    basis of the allegations made in their claim they do have standing to impugn
    GrantÂ’s actions. They ask: Â“If the Appellants do not have standing in that
    regard, who does?Â” They do not, however, answer the question.

[49]

As I would grant the appellants leave to amend their pleading so that
    the action can proceed based on the alleged existence of an oral agreement
    concerning the Property, it is unnecessary to decide this issue. I would,
    however, make the following observations.

[50]

At common law, a general power of attorney terminated upon the grantorÂ’s
    subsequent mental incapacity or death, and only the grantor or the grantorÂ’s
    estate had standing to call the donee to account for his actions as attorney:
    see
Axler v. Axler
(1993), 50 E.T.R. 93 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at p. 99,
per
Borins J.;
Leung Estate v. Leung
(2001), 38 E.T.R. (2d) 226 (Ont.
    S.C.), at p. 229.

[51]

The common law relating to powers of attorney has, however, been
    supplanted in Ontario by statute. Powers of attorney are now governed by the
Powers
    of Attorney Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.20, and the
Substitute Decisions
    Act, 1992
, S.O. 1992, c. 30. The
SDA
is a comprehensive statute
    which governs, among other things, all aspects of continuing powers of attorney
    for property and powers of attorney for personal care.
Section 42(1) of the
SDA
provides: Â“The court may, on application, order that all or a specified part of
    the accounts of an attorney or guardian of property be passed.Â” The persons who
    may bring an application for a passing of accounts are listed in s. 42(3) and
    (4), and include: Â“Any other person, with leave of the court.Â”

[52]

A line of jurisprudence in Ontario interpreting the
SDA
has
    held that, following the grantorÂ’s death and where the attorney and estate
    trustee are one and the same person, there can be no true accounting as between
    the attorney and estate trustee. As a result, courts have permitted
    beneficiaries and others in this circumstance to seek leave, as Â“any other
    personÂ” under s. 42(4), to apply to the court for a passing of the attorneyÂ’s
    accounts for the period the attorney acted prior to the grantorÂ’s death: see
De
    Zorzi Estate v. Read
(2008), 38 E.T.R. (3d) 318 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 11-13;
McAllister Estate v. Hudgin
(2008), 42 E.T.R. (3d) 313 (Ont. S.C.), at
    para. 9;
Carfagnini v. Carfagnini Estate
, 2014 ONSC 3575, at paras. 17-18;
Testa v. Testa
, 2015 ONSC 2381, 10 E.T.R. (4th) 192, at para. 39;
La
    Croix v. Kalman
, 2015 ONSC 19, at para. 40.

[53]

The
SDA
and related jurisprudence were not before the court and
    therefore we did not hear argument on it. I raise it only to indicate that the
    law in this area is evolving and to point out that the
SDA
provides a
    mechanism for a third party to compel an attorney to account. My comments
    should not be taken as suggesting that any application by the appellants under
    the
SDA
would ultimately be successful.

Disposition and Costs

[54]

I would allow the appeal and grant leave to amend the claim, and would
    permit the appellant to serve and file within 60 days of the date of the
    release of these reasons an amended statement of claim that pleads the existence
    of an oral agreement concerning the Property with proper particulars. I would
    permit the respondent to serve and file an amended statement of defence to that
    claim in accordance with the timelines set out in r. 18.01.

[55]

I would set aside the costs awarded at first instance to the respondent
    on the motion and instead would order that there be no costs of the motion. The
    appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal which, as agreed, are
    fixed at $15,000 inclusive of all applicable taxes and disbursements.

DOCKET: C61080

Weiler, Cronk and Benotto JJ.A.

BETWEEN

Appellant

(Respondent in application)

and

Muslim Green Cemeteries Corporation

Respondent

Sergiy Timokhov, for the appellant

John J. Longo and Patrick Copeland, for the respondent

Heard: April 11, 2016

On appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas R. Lederer of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 20, 2015.

By the Court:

I. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Introduction

[1]

The appellant, Toronto Muslim Cemetery Corporation (Â“TMCCÂ”), appeals
    from the summary judgment granted by the application judge: i) declaring that
    the document signed by the parties on May 13, 2014 (the Â“May AgreementÂ”) is
    Â“the Â‘formal agreementÂ’ referred to in the Memorandum of UnderstandingÂ” signed
    by the partiesÂ’ representatives on April 13, 2014 and that it is Â“a contract
    that binds the partiesÂ”; and ii) directing that the May Agreement be rectified
    by the removal therefrom of clause 7(7), which read: Â“within 4 weeks, a formal
    agreement shall be made between the partiesÂ” (the Â“Formal Agreement ClauseÂ”).

[2]

At the conclusion of oral argument on behalf of TMCC, the court
    dismissed the appeal for reasons to follow.Â  These are those reasons.

II.Â  Â Â Â Â  Issues

[3]

Although the appellant advanced numerous grounds of appeal in its
    factum, at the appeal hearing those grounds were narrowed to three:

(1)

Did the
    application judge err by granting rectification of the May Agreement based on
    mutual mistake regarding the inclusion of the Formal Agreement Clause?

(2)

Did the
    application judge err by holding that the May Agreement constitutes a final and
    binding contract between the parties?

(3)

Did the
    respondent, Muslim Green Cemeteries Corporation (Â“MGCCÂ”) breach the May Agreement?

III.Â  Â Â Â  Discussion

[4]

The focus of TMCCÂ’s oral submissions was the claim that the application
    judge erred by applying the wrong test for rectification of the May Agreement,
    namely, rectification based on mutual, rather than unilateral, mistake.

[5]

With respect, this puts the cart before the horse.Â  No issue of
    rectification arises, on any basis, unless it is first determined that the
    application judgeÂ’s central finding Â– that the May Agreement constitutes a
    binding contract Â– is sustainable.

[6]

We have no difficulty in concluding that this core finding is amply
    supported by the evidentiary record.Â  As the application judge put it, at para.
    23:

In summary, the payment and acceptance of the deposit, the due
    diligence along with the identification and retaining of consultants, the
    advertising by the applicant in company with the request for its membership
    list and the making of the planning application paid for by the applicant and
    signed on behalf of the respondent establish that
the parties were acting
    under, and in compliance with, the agreement signed on May 13, 2014.Â  They both
    acted as if it was the formal and final agreement between them
.Â  [Emphasis
    added.]

[7]

On the evidence before the application judge, these conclusions are
    unassailable.Â  The conduct of the parties, both at the time of formation of the
    May Agreement and in its immediate aftermath, was consistent with the intended
    finality and binding nature of the May Agreement.

[8]

The appellant contends that the application judge erred in concluding
    that the May Agreement was final and binding because the partiesÂ’
    communications and dealings prior to its execution established that the involvement
    of lawyers to negotiate and prepare a formal agreement was a condition
    precedent to any final and binding contract.

[9]

We disagree.

[10]

The
    application judge considered and rejected this argument.Â  While an early draft
    memorandum of understanding between the parties contemplated solicitor
    involvement in concluding a formal agreement, no such requirement anywhere
    appears in the May Agreement.Â  As the application judge said, at para. 26:

The difficulty is that, while the parties upon the signing of
    the agreement acted in response to their obligations under it, there is nothing
    they did that would serve to confirm the understanding that there was no
    agreement and would not be until lawyers became involved.Â  To my mind, the
    removal of the reference to lawyers in the April 13, 2014 version and continued
    in the May [Agreement] suggests that changes had been made and that lawyers
    were no longer needed to finalize the agreement.

[11]

The
    application judge reviewed in detail four categories of evidence relied on by
    TMCC as supporting its claim that the parties intended that lawyers would
    prepare a formal agreement evidencing their bargain and that no binding
    agreement would exist until this had occurred.Â  The application judge concluded
    that none of this evidence established this claim.Â  For example, he held:

(1)

There is
    nothing in what was said that demonstrates any agreement that lawyers were
    required, as part of the arrangement between the parties, to approve or review
    the agreement before it would become binding on them (at para. 33);

(2)

Either
    party could review the agreement with lawyers, but it was their individual
    decision whether or not to do so.Â  There was no legal obligation that this had
    to be done before the contract could be considered final (at para. 38); and

(3)

Actions do
    speak louder than words. The statements relied on by [TMCC], particularly when
    used out of context and without concern for the circumstances in which they
    were made, cannot set aside the actions of the parties taken in response to the
    execution of the [May Agreement] (at para. 45).

[12]

We
    agree with the application judgeÂ’s conclusion on this issue and with his
    reasoning in support of it.Â  At the end of the day, he held that the language
    of the May Agreement and the partiesÂ’ own conduct at the time of and following
    the time of its execution belied the assertion that, by May 2014, solicitor
    involvement remained a condition precedent to the creation of a binding
    agreement between the parties.Â  This holding is firmly anchored in the
    evidence.Â  We see no basis for appellate interference with it.

[13]

We
    come then, to TMCCÂ’s argument that the application judge erred by applying the
    wrong test for rectification.Â  This argument arises from the inclusion of the
    Formal Agreement Clause in the May Agreement.Â  On its face, this provision is
    inconsistent with the notion that the parties intended the May Agreement to
    constitute a final and binding contract.

[14]

However,
    the application judge reviewed the various draft memoranda of understanding
    between the parties and the documents entered into by them prior to execution
    of the May Agreement.Â  He found, on the whole of the evidence, that the Formal
    Agreement Clause had been carried forward into the May Agreement from an
    earlier document by mutual mistake.Â  This finding was open to the application
    judge.Â  It accords with the development over time of the documents evidencing
    the partiesÂ’ evolving agreement.Â  It also accords with the other terms of the
    May Agreement, as acted on by the parties.

[15]

In
    these circumstances, the authorities relating to unilateral mistake relied on
    by TMCC are irrelevant.Â  On the application judgeÂ’s findings, the relevant test
    for rectification was that applicable to mutual mistake.Â  We see no error in
    his rectification order.Â  This ground of appeal therefore fails.

[16]

The
    final ground advanced by TMCC concerns MGCCÂ’s alleged breach of the May Agreement.Â 
    As TMCC concedes, this argument formed no part of its case or argument before
    the application judge.Â  Instead, TMCC raises it for the first time on appeal.Â 
    As a result, the evidentiary record on this issue is incomplete, at best.Â 
    Further, this court does not have the benefit of any findings by the
    application judge on the issue, and MGCC has had no opportunity to respond to
    the breach claim or to lead evidence to address it.

[17]

In
    these circumstances, it is not open to TMCC to advance this argument on
    appeal.Â  We note, in any event, that it is wholly inconsistent with TMCCÂ’s
    primary assertion that the May Agreement is neither final nor binding.

IV.Â  Â Â  Disposition

[18]

The application judge reviewed the contested issues in this case and the
    entirety of the relevant evidence in detail.Â  He provided clear and cogent
    reasons for his finding that the May Agreement constitutes a binding contract
    between the parties.Â  That finding is sustainable on this record.Â  TMCC,
    therefore, must live by the bargain it made.

[19]

Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.Â  MGCC is entitled to its costs of the appeal, fixed in
    the total amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable
    taxes.

<p>The LeXFiles is a new diverse English multinational legal corpus that we created including 11 distinct sub-corpora that cover legislation and case law from 6 primarily English-speaking legal systems (EU, CoE, Canada, US, UK, India).
The corpus contains approx. 19 billion tokens. In comparison, the "Pile of Law" corpus released by Hendersons et al. (2022) comprises 32 billion in total, where the majority (26/30) of sub-corpora come from the United States of America (USA), hence the corpus as a whole is biased towards the US legal system in general, and the federal or state jurisdiction in particular, to a significant extent.</p>

<p>[1] We consider only U.S. Court Decisions from 1965 onwards (cf. post Civil Rights Act), as a hard threshold for cases relying on severely out-dated and in many cases harmful law standards. The rest of the corpora include more recent documents.</p>
<p>[2] Sampling (Sampl.) ratios are computed following the exponential sampling introduced by Lample et al. (2019).</p>
<p>Additional corpora not considered for pre-training, since they do not represent factual legal knowledge.</p>
