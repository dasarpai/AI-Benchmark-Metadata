I just heard back from a friend of some people that worked at my old job, a local NYC roaster with around 200 employees and 9 locations. We’ll call them Cafe Mooby. Cafe Mooby stayed open until the last minute, and then terminated everyone’s employment. From my experiences with my company, I was allowed to use my sick pay to get one extra paycheck after leaving work, and being told that as soon as I want to come back, I can do so without any paperwork. The move from Cafe Mooby seems super shady, and they did a bunch of shitty things when I worked there.

The policy states that between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in certain lots and between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in other certain lots due to snow removal from all the parking lots. \n\nAfter the storm my wife, who works from home some days, was not available to move her car during these very specific times for plowing. When she was able to get outside and move her car she was advised by representatives of the property management company that she gets a pass this time but next time they will fine us $50 if they have to text us to remind us to move our car and $100 if the car isn’t moved in what they called a “reasonable timeframe”. \n\nNowhere in my signed lease does it mention anything about moving cars for snow removal or reference any policies regarding snow removal or fines. They posted the policy well after our signed lease and did not request any confirmation of receiving the policy or signature stating that we agree to the policy.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Landlord is updating snow removal policies and imposing fines&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1589320125,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,589,320,125&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gil879/ceiling_collapse/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gil879&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hello all, I moved into my apartment in August of 2019, and when I moved in the ceiling had collapsed in the bedroom. My landlord had fixed the ceiling within two weeks so that was okay for me because my classes hadn’t started. Fast forward to today, I go to check on my apartment because I am at home with my family because of covid I walk in and the ceiling is collapsed again this time breaking my dresser, flatscreen tv and ruining my clothing and bed. Keep in mind this had just been replaced less than a year earlier(10 months). So I call him and don’t get a call back for about an hour to which he replies “ well I’m not sure if I can get that fixed because of the virus probably not for a month or two”. Is there anything that can be done because I had planned to move back in but I cannot because there are wires from the ceiling to the floor, insulation and ceiling tiles all over.

Due to the pandemic, our venue has started rescheduling May, June, July, and August weddings. We are trying to reschedule ours, and are faced with the following challenges:\n\n1. On our call last week, we were told of multiple September dates being available. On our call today, only one September date remains. Our coordinator told us they were rescheduling chronologically and we would be able to pick dates within our wedding month in 2021. It appears they are not following their own process - where did those other September dates go?\n2. September 5th, 2021 is available, but the venue is charging 2021 pricing to rebook. This would be a 30% increase on what we are paying in 2020. \n3. Force Majoure has been applied to May, June, and July, but not August and September as of yet.\n4. Our contract really does not leave any room to cancel without engaging in a legal battle.\n\nI'm wondering how we can negotiate or find a way to move our wedding to 2021 without incurring this astronomical pricing. It feels we are trapped on both sides (if we cancel, we lose money, if we reschedule we lose money).\n\nWe have set up a call with the COO of the venue to try and negotiate... any tips are appreciated.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Need Help with Rescheduling 2020 Wedding&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;contract&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1578696054,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,578,696,054&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/emyi6q/tx_emergency_advice/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;emyi6q&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;So not 100% sure where this goes but I figured this would be the best place for right now.\n\nI live in Tx and recently there was an altercation so I live with grandparent who wants me to leave but my stuff and everything I own is in there.

I had finally had enough in January when she began screaming at me about something very unimportant as I was leaving for work so I sent an email to my landlord requesting that she be asked to leave. This didn't accomplish anything as the landlord is her soon to be parents in-law, and I was deferred to talking to their son the \&quot;property manager\&quot; and was told to just be nicer to her and do as she says. This being something I refuse to do as she is an nonpaying tenant of the house. Every since I did this she has had it out for me, trying to find anyway to get me evicted from the house. \n\nOn Friday night P 'caught' two of my other roommates and I vaping in one of their bedrooms after barging in without being invited in and reported it to the landlord under the premise that I was the only one doing it and that I was actually smoking. Which is something I don't do anymore as I quit cigarettes last summer when I began vaping which I have been doing all year in the house without a problem. From my understanding of Minnesota law they would need to also list in the lease that vaping is not allowed as its a residential house, is this correct? And is there a way for me to break the lease as they are unwilling to remove P from the house and she is causing me mental/emotional harm?&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[MN] Issues with live-in guest and threats of eviction&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1588927795,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,588,927,795&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gfpi91/the_company_im_renting_from_hasnt_taken_care_of/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gfpi91&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I have lived in this apartment for a year and a half now. I am a college student renting for the first time, so I'm not really experienced with how all this service request stuff is supposed to work. \n\nLast winter, we had a mice issue. We called the property owner and sent in the work order. It was taken care of quickly and we didn't see them again until this January. We called and had them set traps and it was caught. However, shortly after this, more mice were seen running around. We repeated the process. No mice were caught. \n\nIn March, I saw more mice and reported this. Someone came out to set traps, but after coming home from a trip to find droppings everywhere, I didn't feel comfortable staying in the apartment and I stayed with friends until a mouse was caught. I explained this to the property manager and asked if there was a way for them to reimburse me for the time I had to stay out of the apartment or the time I would spend cleaning up after it (it also chewed on the walls, doors, and desk in my room). I received 25 dollars in credit for laundry. \n\nShortly after I moved back, I heard more scratching and kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye. For a month, I thought I was being paranoid, as I called in again and they said the traps haven't caught anything. However, today while I opened my oven door, I saw another mouse run between my feet and into my living room before making a dash for the hallway closet. I don't understand how they could have not caught these mice already, especially when I asked them again last week to set up more traps because I heard and recorded the mice chewing on the wall behind the oven again. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this?

The usual way happened to be across a small bridge that a state inspector had condemned for a very long time before our county finally decided to close it to bring in contractors to repair it (though there really hasn’t been much progress in almost a year) and our detour took us through several miles of unmarked dirt roads through forest service land, and another bridge that quickly had to be shut down because it was unsafe (meaning more detours through crappy dirt roads). I try to be understanding because we’re in a poor part of a poor state so there’s probably not much money there to do maintenance with, but I’m very worried that this is becoming a serious safety issue. \n\nThe dirt roads are very narrow and winding, so meeting a car going the other direction is rather dangerous, with more than one person ending up stuck in a ditch trying to avoid a car. \n\nBetween a few heavy storms and all the traffic of our community using the dirt roads, they are now full of potholes and the county won’t send people to re-grade them anymore. \n\nAnd between the state of the road and the poor signage marking the detour I’m very worried that in an emergency, ambulances and fire trucks wouldn’t be able to reach us in time, if at all. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge no one has been injured yet but I’m worried that nothing will be done about this until someone get seriously hurt and sues.

I work at one of these big names companies.  Started working there 8 months ago.  Two months into my job, a new manager came in and replaced my hiring manager.   Things between us were not working well.\n\nIn September, this manager responds to one of my emails using terms that I found offensive.  I took this to the HR and mentioned to them that this was verbal abuse, disrespectful, and verbal harassment.  The HR after a month time dismissed the case saying my alleged claims of harassment and verbal abuse were false.  They also said they identified “opportunities” to improve the relationship moving forward!  I was so disappointed and felt that there was bias in their decision.  The comments the manager made to me in writing are derogatory to say the least.\n\nIn Texas.  When I told the HR and the employee relations the least I would expect is an apology, they said they cannot have him apologize.  The HR even said they were glad that my claims were dismissed!  So as a result, I decided to respond back to that three-month old email from my manager and copy the HR saying to him that his choice of words to put me down reveals a lot the true leadership style he has.  I told him I would put this behind my back now if he does not do this again.  I did not use derogatory words and was assertive in my email.\n\nNow the HR wants to meet with me again to discuss this last email.  Can they fire me for standing my ground?

It would've been fixed had the store manager let yea assistant manager just add in the hours, but they decided to go through HR.

But this never happened. I'm tired of bringing this up and feeling like I'm nagging and yet nothing changes. \n\nToday I finally called for myself and was given a phone number for \&quot;Mrs. X\&quot; the zone payroll coordinator.

Unfortunately, from what my family could tell, he became delusional about his own imminent death, and did not believe he would die. As a result, he made no preparations, no will, no funeral instructions, no goodbye letters/videos, nothing.\n\nI have no doubt my father would have specified in a will to provide his estates assets to both me and my brother, had he been capable of assessing the situation.\n\nIs there any legal basis that would allow me to inherit my fathers estate without it first being used to pay off his debts?&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm 21, my mentally ill father died, and left no will.

I have a text from Sarah saying that she needed to take the money out in cash because she couldn't find the checkbook in order to pay daycare.

Our current lease is up at the end of August. Our first year was fairly uneventful, although the apartment is not in great condition. When we have needed repairs, the landlord does the absolute bare minimum to satisfy the request. We rent from a management company and it is obvious that they work to have everything just within code, and nothing extra, in order to maximize profits for their clients (the building owners). We have a number of code violations, which the landlord has failed to address, so I am trying to figure out the best plan of action.\n\n\n**The issues**:\n\n\nIn the past few months, things have just really started to fall apart. We live in an old brownstone in the garden level unit. We have had two separate leaks, one due to rain in December, and one current leak (started 10 days ago) due to melting snow/ice. The landlord did nothing about the rain leak and so far has done nothing about the new leak. They claim that they can’t do anything until all the snow and ice outside has melted. That may be true, but this leak has revealed extensive water damage, likely from years of small water drip that we did not notice. It is mostly occurring in our coat closet and you can see that the landlord had boarded up the damaged drywall in the past. The current drip is so bad that the drywall has basically turned to mush and the board has fallen out. I think this is clear evidence that the landlord knew about the leak before we moved in and did not do anything to weather proof the unit.\n\n\nWe also are having ongoing heat issues. The apartment has drafts and is not properly insulated. The heat is working, but our space does not get above 62 degrees at night or day, which is less than what the housing code requires. The landlord wants to get us a space heater, but we have also had some electrical problems with lights burning out and regular appliances faulting the circuit, so I am not sure if this is safe (never mind the fact that heat is supposed to be included in the rent and the space heater would jack up our electric bill). Finally, we have had issues with our front door getting stuck and we can’t open it. I had the maintenance guys fix it, but I realized after they left that they simply took the weather strip off the bottom. Needless to say, our heating situation has worsened. I informed the landlord of this and it’s been a week now, no action.\n\n\n**Steps I can take?**\n\n\nI sent a letter to the landlord, certified overnight, stating that we will begin to withhold rent, starting next week, if these issues are not fixed. I gave them until close of business on February 24th. They came the next day and I walked through the unit with them, point out all the issues. I was informed that they can’t do anything about the leaks until spring and that they will decide how to deal with the heat, after an electrician evaluates the unit. Three days later and they’ve sent no one over to our unit. They haven’t even fixed our door, which is quite clearly a major part of the heating problem. I have documented everything, including saving PDFs from their own online maintenance request system. We’ve taken lots of pictures. I have maintained a journal of the temperature in our apartment and conversations I've had with maintenance guys or the management. We also have pictures of water damage at the location of both leaks, from our move in 18 months ago (as part of our documenting the unit's condition). At the time, we thought it was an old issue and assumed the landlord fixed it. There is a clear story shown here of the company ignoring problems we notified them of or not adequately fixing the issue.\n\n\nI’m pretty sure they can’t sufficiently fix everything (especially the leaking) while we are living here and likely not until spring either way. If things aren’t magically fixed by Tuesday night, we will put March’s rent in an escrow account and send a certified letter to the landlord explaining our decision to withhold rent. We are starting to think about breaking our lease, but want to make sure we do it properly. Here are my questions:\n\n\n1. I have read that the landlord has 30 days to address structural problems, like leaking. It’s been 60 days since our December leak, but we also aren’t currently having water come through here (it only lasted for ~12 hours). Does this count as an unresolved problem, since water will inevitably leak in the future, as evidenced by the water damage? \n\n\n2. In terms of our newer leak, it has only been 10 days, but can I claim that the landlord knew about the problem when we moved in? If yes, then this has been left unresolved for well over 18 months (when we moved in) and likely they’ve known about it for years. \n\n\n3. It has been 30 days since we first told them about our heat and 10 days since I began pestering them about it again. I think the landlord will claim they thought they fixed it 30 days ago and only became aware it was still an issue 10 days ago. A landlord has 24 hours to address heating issues, but I am wondering if this is technically a structural issue (unit is not weather tight) and therefore the landlord would have 30 days? We do technically have heat coming out of the baseboard.\n\n\n4. As everything stands now, can we claim that the landlord has already violated the warranty of habitability? Or should I wait until 30 days has passed, since we began to have water leaking in our entryway? I don’t want to move too quickly and have the landlord claim that they haven’t had a chance to fix the issues.\n\n\n5. I really *really* want to avoid going to court, if at all possible. However, I am afraid to sign a new lease and then have our current landlord pull us into court a month later. I think we’d win, but the nightmare situation would be that the judge decides we can’t break our lease and then we’re stuck renting two units. Is it unwise to break the lease without going to court?\n\n\n6. We will be calling the city next week to send an inspector. Is there anything I should consider before doing this? \n\n\n7. In terms of security deposit, the landlord has 30 days to return this after the end of your lease. Does our lease still technically end August 31st, if we move out early? Or does end when we move out, having broken the lease? Does the landlord have to return our deposit on last month’s rent, even if the lease says we forfeit this by moving out early?\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text followed by 30 questions. I appreciate any and all tips! I should emphasize that my ultimate goal at this point is to just get out of this lease ASAP, unless the landlord magically fixes/renovates everything.\nEdit - words/details\n&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Breaking lease due to failure to have repairs made - MA&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1517602071,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,517,602,071&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7uu3rj/child_support_arrearages_in_ohio/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;7uu3rj&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Long story short, my husband dated a girl and she lied about being on birth control and became pregnant. They broke up before she even knew she was pregnant. My husband was excited about being a father. She refused to let him come to any ultrasounds, or even to the delivery! She had full physical custody and he paid for formula, diapers, clothes etc. She then refused to stop letting him see her so he took her to court. He was granted custody every other weekend and was ordered to pay support. She once again stopped letting him pick her up and he paid about 6k in legal fees to fight her in court. He then got into some legal trouble and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. During that time she took their daughter across state lines, got married, and her husband adopted her. He couldn't go to the adoption hearing because he was IN PRISON. His daughter is now 14 (will be 15 in september) and we just received a letter saying he's in contempt for owing 13k in arrearages (364 to the state, the remainder to the mother) when he got the letter regarding her adoption her attorney said all future support would be terminated and that he was not in arrearages at the time of adoption.

It's a legitimate legal concern for a lot of people who may be going through similar. Keep your shitty bigotry out of it. \n\nTL;DR: I just renewed my passport but need to file a DS-11 to update my gender and name. If it were just the name, it could be done free. The gender change is going to run me $110. My first passport was listed in the correct gender, but was changed because I was a minor at the time; is there anything I can do to avoid the fee? \n\nLocation: United States, specifically MA. \n\nI'll try to keep this as brief as possible - \n\n I'm a transman and just renewed my passport in Oct 2017 so I wouldn't have to pay to file for a new one. I had read that a name change done in the same year as a renewal won't cost another filing fee, but no one told me a gender change would mean filing for a completely new passport (if I'd have known, I obviously would have let it expire and just done the new one). Firstly, I don't believe this is fair since I can make the correction to my name, but not my gender. Secondly, my first-ever passport was in the correct gender (male; a \&quot;mistake\&quot; from the third party my guardian went through), and I did travel with it. My second had the \&quot;corrected\&quot; gender on it (female; \&quot;fixed\&quot; from the first one because I was still a minor and not in control of the situation), and I also traveled with it. This most recent one has the same information as the second one, and was just issued in Oct 2017. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to get it back to the original \&quot;male,\&quot; or else if I have any other options to not have to pay for a new passport when I *just* got one, especially considering the name change would have been free. \n\nAny advice would be awesome.

The complex has known serious crime issues (years’ worth). I no longer feel safe and want an option to leave if I want to sooner/before our lease ends. \n\n——————————————-\n\nAside from the normal loud neighbors, bad pet owners, shit and pee in places they shouldn’t be... My boyfriend and I gave our new apartment the benefit of the doubt even after the plethora of negative reviews, including break ins and cars being stolen from the garage. \n\n15 days after moving in, we discovered that our storage unit got broken into on 12/5/19.  We don’t know if it occurred that day, or the day before, but this is when we discovered that someone broke the handle to get into our storage unit. The shittiest part is that the lock/handle itself is provided by the apartment complex and they told us that they are aware of it as an issue (aka, it easily breaks).\n\nBurglar stole my luggage (with a bunch of my lingerie, lol), and damaged my bf’s storage box. \n\nA police report was filed, I also filed a claim with my insurance, and, of course notified the leasing office to their horror. When we went in there, our leasing guy said, “THIS IS THE THIRD ONE.” Not sure if he meant that day, that week, or this month...\n\nThe handle was replaced the same-day. We asked if we can have our front door replaced too because our storage and front door keys are the same, but they said NOPE!\n\nThis really upset me because I inquired about these negative reviews to the leasing consultant I’ve been dealing with from the beginning and was told (I have emails) that the robberies are, essentially, not happening anymore, and that it’s not “that bad.” \n\nAfter the break in, it has been a can of worms. I find out my neighbor next door had his car broken into. Then today, I see that a girl wrote a review after my review (Yelp) reporting that her storage got broken into as well, AND her car also got stolen... She lives on the top/4th floor and I live on the first floor. \n\nLike I said, these are known issues.  You can scroll through Yelp. I did the math and at least 15% of the Yelp reviews talk about the robberies. \n\nA couple of things I want to note are:\n\n1) This complex is about 3 years old and have gone through at least 2 other property managements \n\n2) Literally anyone can get in here. Common areas are not protected, we have a big back gate, and side gates. I saw someone hop that side gate last weekend cause it’s pretty low. They leave the back gate open when it’s not supposed to (even over night). We have fob keys but not all the common area require them, such as the elevator. Common outside areas also do not have enough lighting. Children play in the alley where the back gate is at!!\n\n3) Our “secured” gate to the parking garage was broken for almost two weeks (it was broken when our storage unit got broken into). It was just fixed today. \n\n4) Around/before my storage got broken into, management sent an email about starting to install a security watchtower, which includes a lot of cameras, and some alert of system that can defect heat signatures. They just began construction of it this Monday based on their email. They only currently have cameras near the amenities. \n\n5) I researched the actual management company and discovered that other properties they manage (outside CA) report the same issues (security sucks).\n\n6) My neighborhood has a relatively high crime rate. The government publication is public and shows the crime rates from January to August of this year (this is the most recent one this year).\n\nI’ve done enough research (or so I think) that talks about Civil Laws here in CA and that it is the landlord’s duty to take reasonable measures to protect tenants from foreseeable crimes...\n\nHowever, I’ve read our lease several times over and all I see is, “fuck you, we’re not liable for anything.”\n\nI just feel misled and I’m still angry. More importantly, I think there should be  legal consequences and/or legal loopholes. \n\nI don’t care if they’re making changes now after years have gone by with the thefts and robberies. Only my bf has spoken with the leasing people here since the break in.  Bf said people in the leasing office were very anxious towards him since they all saw my Yelp review (i’m a “Yelp elite,” but that doesn’t matter) and said that corporate is aware of it as well. \n\nSo, yeah, I just want to know if there is a loophole around my 15 month lease because 15 months is too fucking long especially after they lost me as a resident two weeks after moving in. And yes, I am an idiot for signing such as a long lease. $2k+ isn’t worth what I’ve experienced so far.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[CA] I moved to a “luxury” apartment complex (barely 3 weeks ago) that has several years’ worth of burglaries, along with other security issues. My storage unit got broken into two weeks after moving in. I no longer feel safe here and want the option to leave.

Because in 12 years they have never lived together, sure they were married and visited one another, but over time it just stopped, so after 3-4 years of visiting eachother on weekends+ going on vacations together (my father paying for her) she just stopped visiting, had better stuff to do, they still talked on the phone every weekend, but that soon stopped aswell, at the moment they have contact every 3-4 months per phone, and she just asks how everything is going and what not. So after 12 years of marriage my father had enough and told her he wanted a divorce. \n\nYou may think it may come from both sides, but here's the weird part. She absolutely refused to move in with him and always told him later, in 2 years when this and this is done, 2 years later she said in 4 years, etc etc, until now. She told him to sell his house (worth quite alot) and that she wouldn't move in with him (meaning she wouldn't want him to buy an appartment for her next to an appartment for him, she doesn't actually want to move in) unless he sold his new house (and got rid of his dog with it aswell). \n\n**And then!** when he finally tells her he wants the divorce, she is shocked (they talk over the phone each 3-4 months..) that he wants it and says she is quite happy as it is now and doesn't want it to change, also her first reaction after hearing this was to yell \&quot;You cheated me with the marriage contract!\&quot; (He made it, so that she wouldn't get his money when they'd split), which obviously reveals that she was just going for his money all along.\n\nNow my 72 year old father atm living in **Hungary** (but actually came from central europe) with diabetes and his bones cracking, is left there standing, wondering what he can do, because she refuses to sign the paper, go to court or do anything, she said she won't move. \nHe now is planning on scheduling an appointment with a lawyer, but it would really help to know what he could actually do? Does he have to go to court? Will it cost him much, what could be possible outcomes? He's really uncertain about it, and I really want to help, but I'm a measly engineering student with no clue on general laws.\n\nI hope the wall of text didn't bury any responses, thank you in advance.\n\n**TL;DR** Father marries Woman, after 12 years of not living together finally realizes she only wants his money, he has a contract, she refuses to sign the papers or show up.

So I went to pay my ticket off on the day that the ticket had told me to pay it off by, but they told me I had to show up in court because technically in the citation I was 13 years old behind the wheel making an illegal u-turn. They ended up fixing the date of birth in the filing for the citation and moved the court date to a later date. \n\nIs there any way I can get out of paying to ticket using the wrong date of birth to my advantage?

I've been out as a trans guy for around 2 years and things usually go smoothly as bullying and that stuff, but schools have never really been great with bathroom/ locker room policies. I know that these laws are complicated but I'm just looking for pointers. \n\nSince the beginning of the school year, I have been told I am not allowed to use the boys restroom and must use the girls. I told the staff (guidance and principals) that I am, under no circumstances, using the girls facilities. They have no gender neutral/ disabled one stall restrooms in the school accept for the library. The library is far away from most of my classes through the day and it is very dysphoric when I walk in/ out of the library just to pee.\n\nI've resulted to try my best to not use the bathroom through the school day. I usually have nothing to eat the whole school day (7 hours) and go home nauseus, tired and with a throbbing headache. It gets worse when I participate in after school activities, as I can be at school for over 14 hours and will not eat anything or go to the bathroom in an effort to not get dirty looks when I need to pee.\n\nSidenote, but I have also been called the wrong name on multiple occasions by substitute teachers (my teachers know my pronouns and my name and respect that) but that results in me being outed to my fellow peers that thought I was just a cisgender guy. The school said I, by myself, have to go to the administrations office 5 miles away from the school and talk with them as there is nothing they can do.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get better policies because the staff at the school has done nothing to help.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;My school is regulating me to the female facilities.&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;school&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:9,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;9&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1422568898,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,422,568,898&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2u4mrz/nvidia_gpu_970_claims/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2u4mrz&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If people haven't heard, there has been a large dispute over the past week or so over the company Nvidia and their line of graphics cards for computers by the name of GTX 970. \n\nThey claimed in the advertisement and selling of the card that it has 4GB of usable VRam, but people have proven that it only has 3.5GBs and is causing performance issues or lack there of extra performance.\n\nNvidia has claimed in tweets and posts on their forums that this was Intended and the card works exactly as they said it would.

About a year ago my wife cheated on me and left our son with her mother in the virgin islands; during this time I had a job up until around August when I got laid off. I went back home (I was prior military) to Virginia for some time and recently came back here to Texas. I checked my mail and I had something for child support; I missed the case and now I am behind in child support like $966 or something close to that. The only thing I saw was a paper dating Dec 2, 2017 with those numbers. I couldn't call them to ask about it because they are closed until monday, but I wanted to ask some questions here because my mind is eating me alive right now. \n\nI currently do not have a job and I plan to get one soon, but currently I have just been living with a buddy and been getting help from my family for my car bill. My question is what can I really do now that I owe child support? I am pretty confused because as far as I know she doesn't even have our son he is still with her mother. Another question I wanted to ask, is it possible to have child support dropped somehow if she agrees? I haven't really done anything wrong to her and until we stopped talking (like July time frame) her and I weren't really fighting or anything, so I believe I can talk to her to drop it if it's possible at least until I get on my feet.\n\n Thanks for any help in advance. &quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Some questions about child support.&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;family&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:41,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1515249699,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,515,249,699&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7ojkpy/would_this_be_considered_a_security/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;7ojkpy&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hi everybody,\n\nMe &amp;amp; my team of 7 and growing have founded a blockchain based startup here in the united states. We are launching our crowdsale soon that we’ve been working on for the past 8 months. We would like to launch a utility token to be available to be purchased by US citizens as this is the largest market and we are seeking legal advice, but all of the firms in the space are asking $50K-$100K to represent our company and considering this industry is approaching $1 Trillion that is very reasonable, but still out of our budget currently. If any securities attorneys are reading this, we are willing to exchange equity in our company for deeper consultation. As of today I would like to know if we would be safe selling this token to US citizens .. here is the following information I believe is important in determining this. \n\n\n1. We do not have an MVP. We will be using this crowdsale to fund the development. \n\n2. Our token is not an ‘investment contract’ , users will NOT be paid in any sort of dividends or tokens for owning our token. \n\n3. We are not promising any types of gains by investing in us. \n\n4. The incentive to using our token within our marketplace is that users get to avoid fees, and they can stake the token to bid on advertisements within the website. User with the highest stake earns the promotion for a set period of time. Other than this there are no incentives to using our token. \n\n\n\nAccording to the latest SEC press releases it seems we are safe, but I’d thought I would double check here to make sure. \n\nWe are very appreciative of any feedback!\n\nThanks. \n\n&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Would this be considered a security?&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;business&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1590622957,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,590,622,957&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/grv2wq/boss_forced_me_to_go_to_the_er_promising_our/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grv2wq&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hi, so at the start of the year I got a new job. During this time, I was also really struggling with a chronic health condition/disability. I manage it pretty well now, but at times it flares up and can cause serious back pain and make it difficult to stand. But I have seen countless doctors and all of them say that I am fine and this condition is unfortunately just something I have to live with. \n\nA few weeks into working at my new job, I had a flare up and asked my then-manager if I could sit down for a minute. When I came back out, he told me he was going to call an ambulance. I tried to explain to him my condition and begged him not to do that, as I couldn't afford an ambulance. He told me that it wouldn't be an issue, and that he had called our GM who confirmed that the company would pay for my bills under workman's comp and I would be fine if I just told the people in the ER that it was a work related incident.\n\nHe continued to blow things way out of proportion and I started to panic, he made me think I could be having appendicitis and that I needed urgent medical attention. I have high anxiety and truly believed him in the moment. The compromise was that I would leave work immediately and drive to the ER myself, so that he wouldn't call the ambulance. I did. I spent a few hours in the ER, they ran a bunch of tests and, of course, found nothing wrong.\n\nWhen I came back to work the next day, my other manager told me that nope, the company would not be helping me whatsoever with the bills and I should never have been told that. She told me I'd be totally fine because hospitals don't bill you right away (as if I was a braindead moron who had never been to a hospital before, thanks for the heads up genius). The manager who caused all of this gave me a half-assed apology and quit the next day, because apparently corporate scolded him a little for the incident.\n\nAnyways, months later, I've just gotten back the bills. They are thousands of dollars. Is there anything I can do concerning corporate? I was told by my superior that they would cover my expenses, just to be told that was all a bunch of nonsense to force me to go to the hospital when it was completely unnecessary.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Boss forced me to go to the ER promising our company would pay my bills- they won't, and now I'm thousands in medical debt&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;employment&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1420511905,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,420,511,905&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2rgyu0/liability_concerns_for_long_term_lending_of_car/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2rgyu0&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I have a car that I would like to leave titled in my name, and licensed in my state (Minnesota).\n\nI would like to lend it to my 25 year old niece (living in a different state) for a period of about 6 months.\n\nI know that she would need to take out her own insurance, and I'm not concerned with any loss or damage to the car. \n\nI am wondering if I would be leaving myself open to any liability by leaving the title in my name?\n\nI have searched around on the web and found conflicting views.\n\nThanks so much for your help and advice.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liability concerns for long term lending of car to relative?&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;insurance&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:8,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;8&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:44,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1421373278,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,421,373,278&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2sl0ai/traffic_accident_police_report_both_parties_at/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2sl0ai&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Four way intersection.

The whole time the truck driver is apologizing for being in the wrong lane and not being able to make the turn not knowing there was two turn lanes how he was lost etc just keeps talking and talking. There is a witness who states the truck was stopped and I turned into the truck. And the truck driver says this as well. This is impossible. I know this turn very well I know there are two turn lanes and make a point to look for the dashed lines indicating lanes and make sure to stay in my lane.  The police report has my side of the story that the truck came out of his lane and struck my car. The report has my story and the truck drivers which matches the witnesses story. The report says we both failed to maintain our lanes. But I know it can't be what happened. \n\nSince I don't have coverage with my insurance to pay for my damaged car there isn't much they can do. I contacted the truck drivers insurance company and they say I was cited which I was not and that the story the truck driver said is the one they believe and they denied I had any claim.  My insurance denied the claim of the tiny damage to the truck based on lack of evidence I caused the accident.\n\nI don't know what to do next.

I'll try to detail all the facts, but please ask me any relevant question that I might not address in this post.\n\nBackground:\n\n* Me: 34 y/o woman, professional, lodging a room in a shared house for a fixed term of 3 months (ending 31st Aug 2016) in Cambridge, UK. I have a written contract for those three months and a \&quot;verbal/email agreement\&quot; with the landlady to give me a brief heads up (we agreed on 24 hours) for when someone would be coming to look at the room I'm currently renting. \n\nSituation: \n\n* I am currently on garden leave, awaiting to move to a new city to pick up a new job there, so I am mostly at home or wandering about the city, organising stuff for the move.\n* Today I was at home, since it's a hot day I decided to stay indoors and relax for a while. I was in my room, headphones on, lounging on the bed in my pajamas eating a sandwich, not a worry in the world. UNTIL TWO UNKNOWN MEN LITERALLY WALKED INTO MY ROOM UNANNOUNCED. Turns out there was a planned house showing (landlady delegated these events to an agency, whose guy had the key to the house - also, I do not have the key to my own room) and NO ONE TOLD ME ANYTHING. Knowing Cambridge and being quite good at judging people's intentions quite fast, I immediately understood what had happened and played it cool, but no lie, for more than a second I thought they were burglars, or worse. I calmly explained to the agent that it was not his fault (he profusely apologised for the intrusion of privacy, he was very nice and I'm 110% sure he was being honest in saying that he didn't expect anyone to be home since he had been told it was an open house showing, which WAS NOT), but then my nerves got the best of me and I sent a scathing email to the landlady telling her that she had crossed a HUGE line, putting not only my right to privacy but also my (and my possessions') safety (I know, I'm 36891213% sure the guys who go looking at houses do not have bad intentions, but it's the principle behind it) at risk. I ccd the other tenants, the property manager and the letting agency.\n\nNow, since you're the experts here, who is in the right? What happened? Should I just expect this to happen again because she has the complete right to do so?\n\nApologies again if this sounds a bit jumbled, but they spooked me quite a lot.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestion you might provide.\n\n\nEDIT: I am Italian, so I know a bit about rental/lodging laws in Italy but I haven't the faintest (nor the ability to fully comprehend them) about British laws.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I am a lodger - tenant let rental agent and perspective buyer come in the house and my room unannounced, with me in the house.&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:49,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1417449213,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,417,449,213&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ny513/need_advice_on_car_incident_and_following_claim/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2ny513&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A few days ago I reversed into someones car on a road outside their home. There was next to no damage to their car and the owner originally told me not to worry about it.\n\nLater that night, her father and boyfriend came to my house, (the address was supplied by the car owners mother who is a courier and had previously delivered to my address and recognised me,) and were very intimidating towards my girlfriend (I was not home), threatening to return and call the police and were generally very agressive towards her. They were not exactly small guys but my girlfriend is tiny, and she did indeed feel threatened.\n\nAnyway, they demanded my information which eventually was provided to them, and the car owner is now looking into making a claim against me, but I believe she plans on claiming for damage which I did not cause to her car (she says there is a dent but I am sure I did not dent it). I have pictures of her car but she does not have pictures of mine.\n\nMy question is, if she does decide to claim against me rather than settle it personally (which I would prefer), how can I ensure I am not mugged off over the damage caused?\n\nAlso, is it okay for her mother to hand out my address to other members of her family?\n\nThanks&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Need advice on car incident and following claim possibility (England, UK)&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;driving&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:50,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1591095220,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,591,095,220&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gv561y/eviction/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gv561y&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;My landlord seems to think that he can send me a text to move in three days for violating our agreement and endangering his health.

Located in Santa Clara county, California. \n\nTo begin, she purchased her house at the end of 2007, roughly 3 years before she and my stepdad even started dating. My stepfather and mother married in 2011 and things were mostly smooth sailing. My stepfather was a huge role model to me growing up, and without him I wouldn’t be part of college athletics like I am today. \n\nThis August my stepfather was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. He began to deteriorate rapidly and was in and out of the hospital for October. At this point he stopped chemo (which was why he was in the hospital from not eating) and began to recover at home for November. Instead of a funeral, he opted for a celebration of life, while he was still around. Roughly 80 people attended on Nov. 16 to see my stepfather and pay their respects. That morning we signed the will with him and multiple people present. We have videos of him from that day in which he is coherent, moving around, and competent. \n\nHe did fall at the end of the day trying to move a table without his cane. Silly I know, but he was a stubborn bastard. \n\nOn November 25, he took a sudden turn for the worse and began to lose mental faculties. At which point he was placed into a medically induced coma by hospice care under a program they called “intensive critical home care.”\n\nOn Dec. 1, he passed away. We lost a great man that day, and it was unfortunate that he went so soon. The following weekend my stepsister’s husband and her stepfather came to collect some dishes and collectibles she wanted that weren’t covered in the will. \n\nNow on to the dirty stuff. Today we received the following letter in the mail:\n\n[Letter we received](https://imgur.com/q41M5hj)\n\nTo begin, this letter was from my stepsisters stepfather, a real estate agent. Now on to my questions:\n\n1. The house was solely in my moms name, and my stepfather never made any payments on it. Does my stepsister have any claim to any value of the house? \n\n2. My stepfather left behind a car, which was in both my mom’s and my stepfather’s name. The car was listed in the will as being left to me. Does she have any claim to the car? \n\n3. This letter seems like a bogus scare tactic, is that correct in assuming it’s a bunch of BS? \n\nI appreciate all of your time and thanks in advance.\n\nEdit 1: we have a meeting setup with an attorney that was recommended to us. We meet with them on Tuesday to hopefully draft a return letter.\n\nSharkshooter21&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;My[m20] mom is being sued by my (ex) stepsister[f35] over my late stepfather’s estate and my mother’s house.&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;wills&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:10,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;10&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:52,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1590462042,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,590,462,042&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gqp02g/ar_my_mom_and_sisters_bf_got_arrested_for/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gqp02g&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hello all!

Right before the corona-virus my mother and father were having a verbal dispute that was completely fine but I walked on the scene and said some stuff and my father went to swing at me; this is not the first time he has done something like this. My sister and her boyfriend were around the corner and heard/saw some of what was happening and ran in to stop my dad we held him down because he was still trying to, and somewhat successfully throwing punches at his kids/kid's SO (ages are as follows me:16 sister:18 bf:19 dad:60 mom:54) my mom ran and grabbed a gun afraid her children were going to get hurt. Once she grabbed the gun she aimed it at the wall near my father. as soon as the gun was at her side I ran over grabbed the gun and dismembered it, we all ran out and after a yelling match and a game of hot potato with gun parts we ran away. My sister, then afraid of our father's mental and physical wellbeing so she called in a welfare check my mom and sister's boyfriend get arrested for domestic assault in the first degree and battery in the first degree separately.

By the time I found out, the \&quot;relationship\&quot; was already over. I texted him to tell him I was pregnant, he said it's impossible because he's sterile. *eyeroll* He was a turd anyway, so I dropped it. I applied for and received assistance from the state, including health insurance, food stamps, and WIC. I had my son in 2008. My name is the only one on the birth certificate. A few months later, the state asked me to provide contact information for the presumed father so they could pursue child support on my behalf. Before doing so, I looked the guy back up (I had no contact info beyond his name and email address anymore) and emailed him with this information. He flipped out, cursing and saying his wife better not find out because they were trying to start a family, yadda yadda. Incidentally, that's why I stopped seeing him, because I found out I was the \&quot;other woman.\&quot; I emailed back, saying that I'd drop it if he agreed to never contact me again and if he agreed to not pursue paternal rights to my child. He did, and I haven't heard from him since. I declined to provide the state with information and never pursued support myself. I just didn't want the hassle or any connection with him whatsoever, even if support was provided with no contact. Dad thought I was nuts. Mom thought I was making the right decision. \n\nIt's been almost 10 years, and I've moved from MO to OK and now I live in FL. Despite his \&quot;verbal\&quot; agreement to not pursue rights, it's always been in the back of my mind that he might one day change his mind, and try to get back in our lives. I still have the email address I used, but I'm not sure if those emails still exist. \n\nI'm about to get married, but we haven't had an in-depth adoption discussion, yet. He's not dismissing it out of hand, but he's the kind of guy who thinks through every scenario's possible outcomes before coming to a decision. It's on our minds because my son is getting treatment for ADHD, and the office we go to will not allow him to make any decisions or bring him to appointments without me, regardless of what I say. He'd consult me before making those decisions, anyway. \n\nI've been operating on the premise that if he's not on the BC, he hasn't contacted us in almost 10 years (beyond an accidental run in at Target when my son was 6 months old. He was there with who I assume was his wife and their 8ish month old daughter. So not only was I the other woman, she was pregnant when we did the do. The panic on his face at the time was, I'm not ashamed to admit, delicious.), and had never provided any support whatsoever, that any case he tried to build would have been worth less than the paper it was printed on, even if I can't find those emails.\n\nDo I really have anything to worry about? Also, if my future husband does decide to adopt my son, would we have to make an attempt to contact the bio-dad for an official relinquishment of rights? Is there anything else I haven't considered from a legal perspective?\n\nThanks. &quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Paternal rights | Missouri/Florida&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;family&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1577566813,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,577,566,813&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/egw6fn/traffic_crash_ticket/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;egw6fn&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;So a little less than a month ago I was involved in a traffic crash, where I was driving a scooter in the city of Aventura (Miami) and crashed into the back of an SUV.

As with most high schools these days, our school is undergoing a “juul epidemic” which has, for most teens across the nation, been an ongoing joke. So I thought it would be funny to poke fun at “the juuling” and made [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/F3Mi4SY) this flyer and hung them around the school, students hang things up all the time. A lot of students thought it was funny. \n\nToday I was buying my prom ticket and the lady selling them pulled out a folder, and pulled out one of the flyers after seeing my school ID and asked if I’d made it. I stuttered and she said again, this time more firmly “did you make it or did someone else make it.” I told her I made it. I believe that was a mistake. She asked me a bit about it and I just told her it was an inside joke amongst the students. She sold me the ticket and i was on my way, this was about an hour ago. \n\nI am a senior in high school and graduating in less than a month. I have never really “been in trouble” in this kind of way, just like detention or ISS for being late or breaking the dress code, but never anything serious. This is a large public high school in Atlanta. \n\nMy friend says I won’t get in trouble over a flyer, but I’m not going to lie I am quite worried. I’m afraid what i believed to be a harmless joke may get me in serious trouble. I’m afraid of the school searching my phone, so I deleted any drug-related pictures (yeah this is just nicotine but still they might use other things against me) and messages off my phone, I have nothing on me or in my bag that could get me into trouble. I’m 18, will the school contact my parents and tell them to do something like search my room, or not allow me to attend college? \n\nMostly I just feel like an idiot but I really can’t afford the consequences and I’m really freaking out to be honest. \n\nTl;dr- made a satirical flyer for prom queen and may get in trouble for it&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;not sure if this is the right place but I’m wondering what could happen to me&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;school&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:9,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;9&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1417995014,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,417,995,014&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2oldnx/contractual_words_that_are_not_defined/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2oldnx&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Los Angels, CA\n\nHello,\nMy coworkers and I signed a contract that had a lot of undefined terms to which we all interpreted differently than our boss. It is my understanding that when a contract does not specify something interpretation belongs to that of the signer, correct? For example in the contract it says \&quot;week\&quot; which all of us took to mean 7 days rather than a 5 day work week. Also, there was no clause about accruing vacation, but a clause about our trial period ending after 3 months which one person took as \&quot;all vacation days are available after those three months\&quot; especially since no accruement were listed on our checks and the spaces for that was blank. While our employer says because non of us have been full time (which is incorrect to begin with) we are just out of the know that these things are standard in all work contracts at companies and dont need to be specified.

This happened while I was asleep at night, during the shelter-in-place period. It's almost impossible for someone to reach and grab from the outside of the balcony - someone has to have jumped over the fence and then grab it. I do live in a gated community (so it's gated, and then I have a 6ft tall wall around the balcony). I don't feel safe living in this unit anymore so I have tried to contact the leasing office to transfer to another unit but they have failed to respond back to me for 3 weeks.\n\nDue to increase in thefts and car break-ins due to economy pitfall, I'm pretty confident more thefts will happen. What really concerns me is though there is no surveillance system to the gate of the community, and the balcony door is very.. balcony-door-ish. Meaning it has a huge square-glass in the middle that anyone can break in. It was not really a problem when I moved in, but now I actually experienced burglary, I do feel little unsafe and the leasing office has done no effort to do accommodate.

I ended our contract early in May 2013, paid move out fees detailed in the contract, and left. In paying the move out fees I made a slight error on the check and X contacted me saying the bank may not accept it and I'd be liable for fees that are associated with bouncing a check. I went to my bank, had the check voided, and mailed another check. X cashed this check in June 2013.\n\nDecember 2014 comes around, a year and a half later, and I'm looking at my financial statements and come to find a check had been cashed that I don't remember writing. I called my bank and they said it was the voided check. She cashed it right before the holidays. Their policy (Navy Federal) is to only void a check for 180 days, after which it becomes stale-dated. However, Navy Federal does not have a policy against cashing stale-dated checks. USAA, X's bank, does, but won't refund the amount because they were not the ones who released the funds.\n\nMy question is: If I sue in small claims court, is there anything you guys can think I can reference that will build my case? I have statements from both banks saying the check should not have been cashed. I have a copy of the contract that details the move out fees. I have a copy of both checks that detail what they are paying (I know what is written on the check and what it is paying for is not legally binding)\n\nThank you and have a good day. &quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Landlord cashed a voided check and took double what move out fees were (Bexar County, San Antonio, Texas)&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1590272302,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,590,272,302&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gpdvu1/what_happens_if_i_notify_the_dol_that_i_have/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gpdvu1&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you don’t need/care about and elaboration, skip to the last paragraph. \n\nMy company has put me on furlough. It has been about 2 months now. I’m not confident that I will be brought back, so I am looking at other options.\n\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely that I will be able to jump into another job and instantly start making as much as I am on currently on UI. Don’t get me wrong I AM making less on UI than I make at work. My furloughed position pays us way more than the market value of similar positions. And doesn’t really help me qualify for a higher paying job somewhere else. At the end of the day, I was going to have this problem anyway if I quit or got laid off. The pandemic has just forced it upon me earlier than anticipated. What sucks is, I’m not really “qualified” to do much of anything else that pays well except sales.\n\nI am wondering if I would be able to continue to receive some benefits if I start work at another company where I would be making significantly less. The reason I would be making less is because it will likely be a sales position that takes time to develop. \n\nI’m scared to make the jump right now, but I think it’s a bad idea to just bet on me being allowed to return to my furloughed job.\n\nI guess basically my question is: what happens when I notify DOL that I have started another job and am making a little money.

I was just dropping off my girlfriend from work she got off at 10:00 PM she got home probably around 10:20. We stopped to get some fast food for some dinner and we parked inside of her condo complex in one of the public parking spaces. We're just sitting there eating, minding our own business when a lady comes out from her back door to come yell at us about idling and my car being loud. My car is pretty loud it's a 2004 Neon SRT-4 with a modified exhaust but we were also parked completely legally. Not revving the engine or driving loudly squealing tires and all. Just sitting there idling. After she's done complaining we shrug it off and eat for another 10-15 minutes before we finish and I take her home which is on the opposite side of where we were parked and she's actually across the street neighbors with my girlfriend. Now I've never had a problem with anyone regarding noise in this complex mainly cause I don't drive like an asshole at 11 at night. So this lady must've just moved in. But while she was getting out I noticed the lady looking through her window and she appeared to be on the phone which inspired me to ask this question. I can only imagine she was calling the cops but I really want to know if what I did was illegal and if I could have been cited for it. I'm familiar with my states exhaust laws (Nevada) I was very meticulous in reading up on them before I installed an aftermarket system and there is close to none. There is a law limiting decibels emitted from an exhaust but it's not heavily enforced whatsoever and even then that's when the engine is at like half RPM or something like that. So was I in the wrong? Or can I tell the lady to bug off next time. Either way she needs to get used to it cause my girlfriend can't drive yet and I'm exclusively her ride basically anywhere. To and from work (Fridays and Saturdays we close at 12 so she's home around 12:45 after cleaning) and to and from school (I'm responsible for picking up multiple people and I pick her up around 6:30) if anyone has any knowledge on this please let me know.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Laws for just letting my car idle?&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;driving&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1588397244,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,588,397,244&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gc12zc/car_accident_without_witness/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gc12zc&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This happened in Washington State in February.   \n\n\nI proceeded straight through an intersection with a green light and had the right of way. It was an intersection allowing left hand turns on green if it was a circle. There was a sign next to the light stating that you yield on green. He entered the intersection, turning left, and we hit each other on the front corner of our cars, making it unclear to everyone who was at fault apparently.   \nAfter the accident he said I ran a red light and he had a \&quot;green arrow\&quot; giving him the right of way. The cops issued no citation to either of us and the cops plus the insurance companies didn't try to gather evidence or video footage to prove who was at fault. They left it as a \&quot;he said she said.\&quot; No witnesses stayed to give a statement. His insurance company denied my claim.   \n\n\nI have now contacted a lawyer but they want to handle the case I had last year where the person admitted that day they were at fault and it's already a \&quot;win\&quot; for me as everything will be covered and taken care of.   \nI'm at a loss here. I don't want to get a lawyer at all let alone a lawyer for a case that I'm already going to get a settlement for just to lose a third of what I'd be getting. I need help with this latest case and honestly don't know what I can do to prove he was lying. I stood on the street corner with a sign practically begging for witnesses and the only guy that stopped to tell me he'd witnessed it never called me.   \n\n\nI need help. I've never had to deal with lawyers and I feel like I'm in a terrible situation where I'm just going to be taken advantage of and exploited. They said they'd think about taking on my second accident after they take care of the first one. What verbage do I need to use here? What language do I need to find a lawyer that's going to take care of the accident I need real help on? What things can I do myself to solve this that I'm not seeing? She said something about a Public Disclosure Something that I could file the get the footage from a gas station that said they wouldn't release the video without a warrant but even with me saying there were cameras at the intersection and the gas station she said it'd be hard to prove and was \&quot;murky\&quot; who was at fault.

Considering no kids, no shared property, nothing to be divided up, I'm attempting a self-litigated (pro se) divorce, for which the forms are already organized in a packet on the SC court website.\n\nFrom what I had read I know that in SC, in a no-fault divorce, we needed a year of separation without cohabitation to be completed before we could file for divorce.  I'm gearing up to file in March, but she moved back to Tahiti last year and is not responding to my emails and I don't know her address.  How am I supposed to serve her in another hemisphere when I don't know where she is?  \n\nI'm guessing that any other way to serve her is going to be ridiculously complicated and expensive and I'm getting worried.

The shower crack was there when we moved in but unfortunately it wasn't documented.  Mind you, the lease specified this shower couldn't be cleaned with anything but liquid soap, as anything else strips the cheap caulking and lining.\n\nWe never got a copy of the condition report when we moved in.  We requested a pre-moveout inspection that she conducted, but she didn't give us a physical itemized statement with the required Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2) language.  Instead, she texted an itemized list, including \&quot;dusty patio; dust in drawers; dust in refrigerator\&quot;. It's my understanding those things can’t be on the list as they're normal wear and tear and can't be deducted from the deposit.\n\nAfter moving out, she sent us a physical itemized list with two estimates--one replacing the entire shower enclosure, and the other replacing 3 mirrored sliding closet doors.  Someone from Home Depot signed the sliding door estimate, saying that they do not install single door panels. The itemized list said that the total we owe against our security deposit was \&quot;TBD\&quot; (to be determined).  Is the remaining life of an item supposed to be considered when calculating repair cost? I contacted her multiple times asking when the shower and sliding doors were initially installed, but she wouldn’t respond.\n\nTomorrow will be 21 days from when we vacated the premises.  Last night, she sent us an email with the 'current total' we owe, saying that we owe the full cost of replacing all 3 sliding closet doors as she's given us opportunity to repair them ourselves but we haven't done so.  She also says she'll send us her receipts within 14 days after she obtains them, and claims that the shower repair must first be approved by the HOA that doesn't meet until later this or next month.\n\nNone of this seems legal, especially considering how she violated Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2).  I went through our lease and discovered she didn't complete the \&quot;Condition of Premises\&quot; section where she was supposed to \&quot;check all that apply\&quot;, including the claim that tenants agreed to the specified condition.  The only thing checked was an item specifying the shower not be cleaned with anything but liquid soap.\n\nAre we liable for the full replacement cost of items if they were not new when we moved in?  Is she required to calculate the cost with consideration to the remaining life of the item(s)?  Is she allowed to bill us the full cost to replace 3 sliding doors when only 1 was damaged? Can she send us another bill in a month for the shower, which she thinks we're supposed to pay full cost to repair?  Our lease says that all parties involved must mediate first in the event of dispute. If she doesn't send us a valid estimate amount tomorrow, can we demand that she mediate as she's not made a good faith effort to be fair or follow the laws as specified?  I’m at my wits end with this lady.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Landlady made us move to remodel, wants us to pay for things we haven't damaged, &amp;amp; plans to send more bills past the 21-day window&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;housing&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1418847261,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,418,847,261&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2plx70/trying_to_get_out_of_an_apartment_lease_the/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2plx70&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is in Western Illinois.\n\nI'm finishing up my last semester at university, and when I signed for this apartment they said that the lease was for a year but there would be no problem for them to find somebody to relet to.

I've been searching on Craigslist as well and haven't found anyone myself, and after talking with the landlord again she doesn't seem willing to cut any sort of deal (offered her the $250 fee mentioned above and the $655 security deposit, no dice).\n\nPretty sure I'm fucked here.

I’m ashamed to admit it, but we’ve done nothing to ensure that if we both die, that the money goes to the right places, is controlled by the right people and to also ensure that should he be in a compromised state, he will have the right people making medical decisions for him as a minor. \n\nSo my question.. is this done with a will? With a will? Where do I start with something like this? I also want directives on custody, handling of finances and so forth. Is this something that could be done through legal zoom or do I absolutely need an attorney? Trying to save as much as possible while also ensuring that this doesn’t end up in curt should something happen.\n\nThanks!&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Making plans should I unexpectedly die.

I totally appreciate that this is a pretty petty concern compared to a lot of what gets posted on here, but we thought it would be wise to reach out for advice in any case.\n\nWe had been looking for a new place for awhile and, in particular, wanted to find one that would allow for extra large dogs. We both love Great Danes and with a rescue specifically for those that have hearing and sight issues due to bad backyard breeding in our area, decided that we wanted our new place to allow for us to adopt one of the many special needs adult dogs in our area a home. We spent a lot of time searching and finally found a place that said specifically on their pet policy page on their home site that \&quot;there is no weight limit for pets.\&quot; In speaking to the leasing agent about this (and a Giant Breed dog in particular) he said it wasn't an issue so long as it didn't go against their breed restrictions, and confirmed that the group that owns this property has a 65lb rule, but that it didn't necessarily need to apply at this location.\n\nSo here's where my question comes in: we had gotten all ready to foster-to-adopt a particular dog and had been in touch with the rescue. Today I went into the leasing office to discuss the process with our agent at which point he pulled out our signed contract that said \&quot;no dogs over 65lbs\&quot; in the fine print. He acknowledged that he had previously said it was ok to go above this limit, but only to the tune of 80lbs max or 100 at an absolute push if it was inconspicuous. Is there any sort of precedent here for false advertising or failing to give us accurate information when it was made clear that this was  contingent upon our signing a lease at this property? We don't have a papertrail of this communication (hindsight is 20/20 now, I know), and aren't particularly interested in strongly pursuing the matter with a lawyer. Rather, we're just wondering if there's a case to be made where we can demonstrate to the office that our leasing agent/the web advertising of this community acted under false pretences.\n\nThanks!&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Texas: Major discrepancy between the pet policy listed on rental home website vs. in our lease.

They're \&quot;taking care of him\&quot;. They've pawned/sold thousands of dollars worth of his things and drive his vehicle without a license. They're known drug users and they have several kids there. I don't speak with any of them and rarely talk to my dad.\n\nA few days ago, he was hospitalized and we're not sure if he's going to make it. He has five acres of land, two mobile homes, a vehicle, and several small storage buildings on the property. \n\nNow, should be die, I would assume it would all go to me (I'm an only child). But, they've claimed several times that he's told them they can have the car, the place, and all sorts of other things. The problem is that I don't have access to his life insurance, will, titles/deeds and such to actually see what's in them. \n\nHow do I go about obtaining this information legally in a way that could not be held against me in court? And is there any way that I could take power of attorney in this situation and have them removed from the home and him put into a proper facility should he come home? Or, just... Idk... what can/should I do in general? He claims that he's of sound mind, but all it takes is having a conversation with him to realize he isn't. \n\nThanks for any advice.&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Family Affair (Georgia)&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;family&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:91,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;created_utc&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1420245091,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,420,245,091&quot;},&quot;full_link&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2r5l8j/i_signed_a_work_contract_and_was_let_go_because/&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2r5l8j&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;So I started working for this company about a month ago.

He struggles in a lot of things and in this story he will seem stupid due to a total lack of social skills and extreme gullibility/lack of \&quot;common sense\&quot; but he has a good heart.\n\nHe met a woman who told him she was hungry and needed a ride home.  He gave her cash for groceries then let her use his credit card to get a Lyft home.   Very kind but extremely naive.\n\nWhen he gets his credit card bill he realizes she has been spending on his credit card (she obviously just has the number and info she took from the lyft ride, not the physical card itself).  He gets scared, he calls her and asks her to stop.  I dont know if he ever texted her or not (I'm going to find that out today).   She tells  him she will stop.  Then the next month, he realizes she is still spending.  He gets scared, and tries ordering a new card, thinking this will \&quot;stop\&quot; his first card.  It obviously doesn't, and she continues to rack up charges in spite of his protests.  Then and only then, he comes in tears to my mother (he was afraid she would be angry at him so he hid it ) and tells her what's going on so she was able to walk him through cancelling his card.\n\nAltogether, she spent over $6000 on his card, spending hundreds of dollars every day.  It's a lot of money for anyone, certainly for a disabled man who is already struggling with just feeding himself and getting his medicines.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a just world, this seems like obvious and cruel theft.  But because he did share his credit card info willingly and permitted her to buy a lyft for herself, I know that the law is more complicated than that.  I know a credit card agreement  states that if you ever let someone use your card they are a \&quot;authorized card holder\&quot; until you both notify the bank otherwise, not sure if that includes a credit card number.  \n\nDoes he have any recourse with the police?

She then just quit and picked up her paycheck.  \n  \nHer “employer” then said that they were paying half minimum wage and not paying for the meeting because it wasn’t actually mandatory (even though it was mentioned so). The meeting still involved them getting trained and cleaning the place though.  \n  \nWhen my girlfriend challenged her employer, they told her it wasn’t actually against the law to pay below minimum wage and that since she didn’t go to the 3 day training yet, she could have just been paid nothing. Basically a kind of “I’m being nice to you so stop complaining” threat.  \n  \nI’ve looked online and saw that you have to pay for training interviews anyway so even if she wasn’t hired she would still have to be paid. We also looked at the Washington State and US labor laws and saw that no employer can pay below 85% minimum and only so with a learner’s certificate. Even then, half minimum is still below 85%.  \n  \nI’m not sure where the law stands about the meeting though.\n  \nShe has now quit because the manager is all types of awful, but is there anything that can be done to salvage the situation and make sure her employer won’t rip off any more employees?  \n  \nOr is there some fine print that she is taking advantage of?  \n\nEdit: The employee is doing this to all their employees.

Do they only make contact in-person or would they call / write if there was a case?\n\nLong story / details I'll try to make as easy to follow as possible while not leaving anything out:\n\n* Girlfriend (we'll call H) has child.  Has roommate (we'll call K) - they don't get along super well, but no big fighting, everything fairly amicable.\n* One night, H and I go out to dinner, K agrees to babysit\n* K calls baby-daddy's sister (we'll call J) saying that we just left and he's crying.  K has not called H to say he's crying and needs here (we would have come back immediately).\n* K claims that H is always drunk, on drugs, etc etc (none of which is true - drug test could be passed with ease).  Tells J and many others this.\n* K moves out but continues making false claims, etc.\n\nDays later...\n\n*  J is a teacher.  She claims that the department of education called her and she's in trouble because K opened a DCFS report and being that she was involved and is a mandatory reporter that didn't report, she's in trouble.\n* J gets a lawyer - lawyer recommends signing temporary custody to her or to baby daddy (but is even hesitant to do the latter) in order to avoid DCFS not taking kid away (although they would have no reason to even if there's an investigation)\n\nHere's what we find fishy:\n\n* DCFS has not contacted H this entire time (original incident was day after Christmas)\n* Dept of ed SUPPOSEDLY called J on New Year's Eve (DOE website indicates they are closed then).\n* As a mandated reporter, according to OCGA 19-7-5, J would only have 24 hours to report before being in trouble anyways. (But IANAL so idk if I'm reading that correctly)\n* Baby daddy has also not heard anything from DCFS yet.\n* All the things that J says H is doing wrong are false accusations she heard from K - never did she witness or suspect any of these things until this point, nor is there any proof or evidence that they're true.  A disgruntled ex-roommate spreading rumors is the gist.\n\nIs there a good way to find out if there's an investigation open?&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[Georgia USA] If a DCFS investigation is opened against you, how soon must they notify?&quot;},&quot;text_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;family&quot;},&quot;flair_label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:9887,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzAzNSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL2pvbmF0aGFubGkvbGVnYWwtYWR2aWNlLXJlZGRpdCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjYzNSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.WKK1eXomTTwp9Pa6yOVXO4EE_tc0EValFoIACTkvgh00Nrp7bsu71kkAEVtqmFianhrPLXFX_rRXDcoRRIQcCQ&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;jonathanli/legal-advice-reddit&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;61ca7ee47d9a271ef3823560&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/573214c3127f7a6aceddcb0d03017d68.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Jonathan Li&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jonathanli&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:1},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

I just heard back from a friend of some people that worked at my old job, a local NYC roaster with around 200 employees and 9 locations. We’ll call them Cafe Mooby. Cafe Mooby stayed open until the last minute, and then terminated everyone’s employment. From my experiences with my company, I was allowed to use my sick pay to get one extra paycheck after leaving work, and being told that as soon as I want to come back, I can do so without any paperwork. The move from Cafe Mooby seems super shady, and they did a bunch of shitty things when I worked there. I’m just curious if it’s legal, and if the workers can file a wrongful termination class-action lawsuit or something?</span></div></div>

The policy states that between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in certain lots and between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in other certain lots due to snow removal from all the parking lots. 

After the storm my wife, who works from home some days, was not available to move her car during these very specific times for plowing. When she was able to get outside and move her car she was advised by representatives of the property management company that she gets a pass this time but next time they will fine us $50 if they have to text us to remind us to move our car and $100 if the car isn’t moved in what they called a “reasonable timeframe”. 

Nowhere in my signed lease does it mention anything about moving cars for snow removal or reference any policies regarding snow removal or fines. They posted the policy well after our signed lease and did not request any confirmation of receiving the policy or signature stating that we agree to the policy.</span></div></div>

My landlord had fixed the ceiling within two weeks so that was okay for me because my classes hadn’t started. Fast forward to today, I go to check on my apartment because I am at home with my family because of covid I walk in and the ceiling is collapsed again this time breaking my dresser, flatscreen tv and ruining my clothing and bed. Keep in mind this had just been replaced less than a year earlier(10 months). So I call him and don’t get a call back for about an hour to which he replies “ well I’m not sure if I can get that fixed because of the virus probably not for a month or two”. Is there anything that can be done because I had planned to move back in but I cannot because there are wires from the ceiling to the floor, insulation and ceiling tiles all over. And to top it off it seems as though a whole chunk of sheet rock and plaster fell through right where I sleep that weighs about 65-80 pounds. If I was there in bed it could of caused some damage. Basically I’m asking what steps should I take and what would you all recommend. Thank you all!</span></div></div>

Due to the pandemic, our venue has started rescheduling May, June, July, and August weddings. We are trying to reschedule ours, and are faced with the following challenges:

1. On our call last week, we were told of multiple September dates being available. On our call today, only one September date remains. Our coordinator told us they were rescheduling chronologically and we would be able to pick dates within our wedding month in 2021. It appears they are not following their own process - where did those other September dates go?
2. September 5th, 2021 is available, but the venue is charging 2021 pricing to rebook. This would be a 30% increase on what we are paying in 2020. 
3. Force Majoure has been applied to May, June, and July, but not August and September as of yet.
4. Our contract really does not leave any room to cancel without engaging in a legal battle.

I'm wondering how we can negotiate or find a way to move our wedding to 2021 without incurring this astronomical pricing. It feels we are trapped on both sides (if we cancel, we lose money, if we reschedule we lose money).

We have set up a call with the COO of the venue to try and negotiate... any tips are appreciated.</span></div></div>

I had finally had enough in January when she began screaming at me about something very unimportant as I was leaving for work so I sent an email to my landlord requesting that she be asked to leave. This didn't accomplish anything as the landlord is her soon to be parents in-law, and I was deferred to talking to their son the "property manager" and was told to just be nicer to her and do as she says. This being something I refuse to do as she is an nonpaying tenant of the house. Every since I did this she has had it out for me, trying to find anyway to get me evicted from the house. 

On Friday night P 'caught' two of my other roommates and I vaping in one of their bedrooms after barging in without being invited in and reported it to the landlord under the premise that I was the only one doing it and that I was actually smoking. Which is something I don't do anymore as I quit cigarettes last summer when I began vaping which I have been doing all year in the house without a problem. From my understanding of Minnesota law they would need to also list in the lease that vaping is not allowed as its a residential house, is this correct? And is there a way for me to break the lease as they are unwilling to remove P from the house and she is causing me mental/emotional harm?</span></div></div>

I am a college student renting for the first time, so I'm not really experienced with how all this service request stuff is supposed to work. 

Last winter, we had a mice issue. We called the property owner and sent in the work order. It was taken care of quickly and we didn't see them again until this January. We called and had them set traps and it was caught. However, shortly after this, more mice were seen running around. We repeated the process. No mice were caught. 

In March, I saw more mice and reported this. Someone came out to set traps, but after coming home from a trip to find droppings everywhere, I didn't feel comfortable staying in the apartment and I stayed with friends until a mouse was caught. I explained this to the property manager and asked if there was a way for them to reimburse me for the time I had to stay out of the apartment or the time I would spend cleaning up after it (it also chewed on the walls, doors, and desk in my room). I received 25 dollars in credit for laundry. 

Shortly after I moved back, I heard more scratching and kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye. For a month, I thought I was being paranoid, as I called in again and they said the traps haven't caught anything. However, today while I opened my oven door, I saw another mouse run between my feet and into my living room before making a dash for the hallway closet. I don't understand how they could have not caught these mice already, especially when I asked them again last week to set up more traps because I heard and recorded the mice chewing on the wall behind the oven again. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Aren't mice a health risk, especially in a kitchen? Is there a more permanent solution?</span></div></div>

The usual way happened to be across a small bridge that a state inspector had condemned for a very long time before our county finally decided to close it to bring in contractors to repair it (though there really hasn’t been much progress in almost a year) and our detour took us through several miles of unmarked dirt roads through forest service land, and another bridge that quickly had to be shut down because it was unsafe (meaning more detours through crappy dirt roads). I try to be understanding because we’re in a poor part of a poor state so there’s probably not much money there to do maintenance with, but I’m very worried that this is becoming a serious safety issue. 

The dirt roads are very narrow and winding, so meeting a car going the other direction is rather dangerous, with more than one person ending up stuck in a ditch trying to avoid a car. 

Between a few heavy storms and all the traffic of our community using the dirt roads, they are now full of potholes and the county won’t send people to re-grade them anymore. 

And between the state of the road and the poor signage marking the detour I’m very worried that in an emergency, ambulances and fire trucks wouldn’t be able to reach us in time, if at all. 

To the best of my knowledge no one has been injured yet but I’m worried that nothing will be done about this until someone get seriously hurt and sues. Is there anything that I’m able to do as a concerned citizen, or do I just have to wait for elections roll around and hope I can vote out everyone that allowed this to happen</span></div></div>

Started working there 8 months ago.  Two months into my job, a new manager came in and replaced my hiring manager.   Things between us were not working well.

In September, this manager responds to one of my emails using terms that I found offensive.  I took this to the HR and mentioned to them that this was verbal abuse, disrespectful, and verbal harassment.  The HR after a month time dismissed the case saying my alleged claims of harassment and verbal abuse were false.  They also said they identified “opportunities” to improve the relationship moving forward!  I was so disappointed and felt that there was bias in their decision.  The comments the manager made to me in writing are derogatory to say the least.

In Texas.  When I told the HR and the employee relations the least I would expect is an apology, they said they cannot have him apologize.  The HR even said they were glad that my claims were dismissed!  So as a result, I decided to respond back to that three-month old email from my manager and copy the HR saying to him that his choice of words to put me down reveals a lot the true leadership style he has.  I told him I would put this behind my back now if he does not do this again.  I did not use derogatory words and was assertive in my email.

Now the HR wants to meet with me again to discuss this last email.  Can they fire me for standing my ground?  What should I expect next?</span></div></div>

I started 3 months ago today and was told I would be paid for the 4 hour orientation. That day is the only one in that pay period, and while I am in the system as having been punched in that day, I have not been paid or gotten a payslip from that week online or in person.

 I've told my managers a total of about 5 times. It would've been fixed had the store manager let yea assistant manager just add in the hours, but they decided to go through HR. I followed up multiple times about that and most recently, about a month ago, I asked again and was told they'd just add in the hours after all because they were having a hard time contacting HR. But this never happened. I'm tired of bringing this up and feeling like I'm nagging and yet nothing changes. 

Today I finally called for myself and was given a phone number for "Mrs. X" the zone payroll coordinator. I called and got a full voicemail box for "Mrs. Y" who I guess is the new payroll coordinator. The voicemail instructed me to email a certain address, so I did, but what now? What are my options if I never hear back? It seems like going to my managers yet again is the only other choice. It's only like $48, but if you say I'm going to get paid, I want to get paid and I also really need every penny.</span></div></div>

Can an underaged passenger get a curfew violation if a validly licensed, legal adult is driving?? Wouldn’t this mean that a kid can get a curfew if the parent is driving? I’m thinking that the cop is overstepping his duties. Please let me know. Thanks!</span></div></div>

My cruise control was set to 82, which is still reckless so I can't say I wasn't going 80. I asked the cop what would happen and he said I would have to take a driving improvement course and pay a fine, and that the ticket wouldn't be on my record after I paid it, and that it wouldn't be on my record at all until my court date, which is in April. I turn 18 in March, so I got the ticket before I turn 18 but my court date is after. Does this change anything? Do I technically have a reckless driving charge as an 18 year old or a minor? Does it make a difference if I show up on my court date with the class already finished? And does the charge actually go away after I pay it and do the course?   
Also, I'm not asking for specific advice on an attorney if I decided to go that route, but if I decide to hire an attorney, should I find one local to where I live or one that is near where I got my ticket? I was about 120 miles away from home when I got pulled over.</span></div></div>

Things went OK for a while, but then the developer got in over his head and stopped paying his bills. 

The developer left me about $8.5K short, and I sued to collect. I sued the golf course LLC, the housing development LLC and the developer himself as a DBA. They all initially fought and refused to settle, but then did not show up for court. I was awarded the full amount in November of 2007. 

Eventually, the golf course and properties were sold off to new owners, and both LLCs are now listed as "Involuntary Dissolution by Court Order" on the state web site.  The developer is MIA. 

My question(s)- Can I go after the new LLC of the golf course or housing development for my judgment?  If I can find the developer, how can I collect from him?  How does one go about finding the developer?

Any insight is appreciated...</span></div></div>

My father ended a relatively short battle with brain cancer 8 months ago.

After he passed, it became clear he left no will. My brother and I are the sole beneficiaries, however there are massive debts against the estate. It stands that little of the money from his estate will make it to me and my brother.

Prior to his illness, my father suffered from intense mental health problems. While I am unsure if he had a formal diagnosis (he likely did, I would probably need to get hospital records), he was admitted to the Psych Ward on several occasions. Unfortunately, from what my family could tell, he became delusional about his own imminent death, and did not believe he would die. As a result, he made no preparations, no will, no funeral instructions, no goodbye letters/videos, nothing.

I have no doubt my father would have specified in a will to provide his estates assets to both me and my brother, had he been capable of assessing the situation.

Is there any legal basis that would allow me to inherit my fathers estate without it first being used to pay off his debts?</span></div></div>

The thief then racked up $700 worth of charges (he has been compensated by his bank if that affects anything) at various stores with in-person transactions. Customer is adamant that the thief is my boyfriend as he was the only staff member working front of house at the bar that day. Work is taking him off the schedule until they can conduct a thorough investigation and when boyfriend asked them to please check the security footage they stalled him out and said they needed to make sure they 'have everything in order'. Until then he's not working indefinitely.

Are they able to do this legally? If they fire him over hearsay is there any legal recourse? Times are a little tough right now with COVID and he just got back to work. I know CA is an at-will state which gives them free reign but accusing someone of stealing $700 is also something that can affect him attempting to get another job. Can he contact the police to clear his name or is the answer to the problem just 'look for another job'?</span></div></div>

 It's my understanding that federal law requires employee consent to record audio, and that violations could result in fines or up to five years imprisonment. If I'm wrong about that, please correct me. If I'm not, there was nothing about this in the paperwork I signed when I began my employment and I've never received any other formal notice either. 

I'd like to know how I can act to protect my privacy without endangering my job. If he were to get arrested or fined, the business would close down. My co-workers and I would be screwed.

Sarah (the mother of my 5yo child, Keri) has been living with my parents for nearly a year, rent free. She has lived in 6 addresses in the past 18 months, all of which for less than 3 months other than when she lived with parents. All of the sudden, around a week and a half ago she moved out while my parents were out of town. She did not tell me, or my parents, and refuses to tell me where she's living or let me see my daughter. I've tried talking to her but she ignores my texts.

I have regularly been paying for daycare with a bank account so she can write checks for daycare. I recently found out that $600 that I transferred to the account in November (and was withdrawn November 6th) went missing and the daycare Keri goes to contacted me saying they did not recieve any payment in November. I have a text from Sarah saying that she needed to take the money out in cash because she couldn't find the checkbook in order to pay daycare. After asking her about it, and specifically saying that if she didnt respond I would go to the police, she claimed she gave them the payment (I do not believe she did). 

She also sent a text message to my mother that said she would meet with her and Keri in a public place but if I showed up they would leave.

I don't have a lot of money to spend on a lawyer but she's keeping my child away from me and at this point I want to file for full custody. What can I do to reduce the legal costs of a custody battle? Is she doing anything illegal that I can at least go to the police and get a temporary custody order?

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">I have been living in my unit for about a year and a half. Our current lease is up at the end of August. Our first year was fairly uneventful, although the apartment is not in great condition. When we have needed repairs, the landlord does the absolute bare minimum to satisfy the request. We rent from a management company and it is obvious that they work to have everything just within code, and nothing extra, in order to maximize profits for their clients (the building owners). We have a number of code violations, which the landlord has failed to address, so I am trying to figure out the best plan of action.


**The issues**:


In the past few months, things have just really started to fall apart. We live in an old brownstone in the garden level unit. We have had two separate leaks, one due to rain in December, and one current leak (started 10 days ago) due to melting snow/ice. The landlord did nothing about the rain leak and so far has done nothing about the new leak. They claim that they can’t do anything until all the snow and ice outside has melted. That may be true, but this leak has revealed extensive water damage, likely from years of small water drip that we did not notice. It is mostly occurring in our coat closet and you can see that the landlord had boarded up the damaged drywall in the past. The current drip is so bad that the drywall has basically turned to mush and the board has fallen out. I think this is clear evidence that the landlord knew about the leak before we moved in and did not do anything to weather proof the unit.


We also are having ongoing heat issues. The apartment has drafts and is not properly insulated. The heat is working, but our space does not get above 62 degrees at night or day, which is less than what the housing code requires. The landlord wants to get us a space heater, but we have also had some electrical problems with lights burning out and regular appliances faulting the circuit, so I am not sure if this is safe (never mind the fact that heat is supposed to be included in the rent and the space heater would jack up our electric bill). Finally, we have had issues with our front door getting stuck and we can’t open it. I had the maintenance guys fix it, but I realized after they left that they simply took the weather strip off the bottom. Needless to say, our heating situation has worsened. I informed the landlord of this and it’s been a week now, no action.


**Steps I can take?**


I sent a letter to the landlord, certified overnight, stating that we will begin to withhold rent, starting next week, if these issues are not fixed. I gave them until close of business on February 24th. They came the next day and I walked through the unit with them, point out all the issues. I was informed that they can’t do anything about the leaks until spring and that they will decide how to deal with the heat, after an electrician evaluates the unit. Three days later and they’ve sent no one over to our unit. They haven’t even fixed our door, which is quite clearly a major part of the heating problem. I have documented everything, including saving PDFs from their own online maintenance request system. We’ve taken lots of pictures. I have maintained a journal of the temperature in our apartment and conversations I've had with maintenance guys or the management. We also have pictures of water damage at the location of both leaks, from our move in 18 months ago (as part of our documenting the unit's condition). At the time, we thought it was an old issue and assumed the landlord fixed it. There is a clear story shown here of the company ignoring problems we notified them of or not adequately fixing the issue.


I’m pretty sure they can’t sufficiently fix everything (especially the leaking) while we are living here and likely not until spring either way. If things aren’t magically fixed by Tuesday night, we will put March’s rent in an escrow account and send a certified letter to the landlord explaining our decision to withhold rent. We are starting to think about breaking our lease, but want to make sure we do it properly. Here are my questions:


1. I have read that the landlord has 30 days to address structural problems, like leaking. It’s been 60 days since our December leak, but we also aren’t currently having water come through here (it only lasted for ~12 hours). Does this count as an unresolved problem, since water will inevitably leak in the future, as evidenced by the water damage? 


2. In terms of our newer leak, it has only been 10 days, but can I claim that the landlord knew about the problem when we moved in? If yes, then this has been left unresolved for well over 18 months (when we moved in) and likely they’ve known about it for years. 


3. It has been 30 days since we first told them about our heat and 10 days since I began pestering them about it again. I think the landlord will claim they thought they fixed it 30 days ago and only became aware it was still an issue 10 days ago. A landlord has 24 hours to address heating issues, but I am wondering if this is technically a structural issue (unit is not weather tight) and therefore the landlord would have 30 days? We do technically have heat coming out of the baseboard.


4. As everything stands now, can we claim that the landlord has already violated the warranty of habitability? Or should I wait until 30 days has passed, since we began to have water leaking in our entryway? I don’t want to move too quickly and have the landlord claim that they haven’t had a chance to fix the issues.


5. I really *really* want to avoid going to court, if at all possible. However, I am afraid to sign a new lease and then have our current landlord pull us into court a month later. I think we’d win, but the nightmare situation would be that the judge decides we can’t break our lease and then we’re stuck renting two units. Is it unwise to break the lease without going to court?


6. We will be calling the city next week to send an inspector. Is there anything I should consider before doing this? 


7. In terms of security deposit, the landlord has 30 days to return this after the end of your lease. Does our lease still technically end August 31st, if we move out early? Or does end when we move out, having broken the lease? Does the landlord have to return our deposit on last month’s rent, even if the lease says we forfeit this by moving out early?


Sorry for the wall of text followed by 30 questions. I appreciate any and all tips! I should emphasize that my ultimate goal at this point is to just get out of this lease ASAP, unless the landlord magically fixes/renovates everything.

They broke up before she even knew she was pregnant. My husband was excited about being a father. She refused to let him come to any ultrasounds, or even to the delivery! She had full physical custody and he paid for formula, diapers, clothes etc. She then refused to stop letting him see her so he took her to court. He was granted custody every other weekend and was ordered to pay support. She once again stopped letting him pick her up and he paid about 6k in legal fees to fight her in court. He then got into some legal trouble and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. During that time she took their daughter across state lines, got married, and her husband adopted her. He couldn't go to the adoption hearing because he was IN PRISON. His daughter is now 14 (will be 15 in september) and we just received a letter saying he's in contempt for owing 13k in arrearages (364 to the state, the remainder to the mother) when he got the letter regarding her adoption her attorney said all future support would be terminated and that he was not in arrearages at the time of adoption. We really don't know what to expect next and are trying to find a local attorney that will give us some guidance. We spoke to child support and they said they really only care about the 300 dollars owed to the state and that his ex can have the past support wiped out. Any advice is welcome!</span></div></div>

TL;DR: I just renewed my passport but need to file a DS-11 to update my gender and name. If it were just the name, it could be done free. The gender change is going to run me $110. My first passport was listed in the correct gender, but was changed because I was a minor at the time; is there anything I can do to avoid the fee? 

Location: United States, specifically MA. 

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible - 

 I'm a transman and just renewed my passport in Oct 2017 so I wouldn't have to pay to file for a new one. I had read that a name change done in the same year as a renewal won't cost another filing fee, but no one told me a gender change would mean filing for a completely new passport (if I'd have known, I obviously would have let it expire and just done the new one). Firstly, I don't believe this is fair since I can make the correction to my name, but not my gender. Secondly, my first-ever passport was in the correct gender (male; a "mistake" from the third party my guardian went through), and I did travel with it. My second had the "corrected" gender on it (female; "fixed" from the first one because I was still a minor and not in control of the situation), and I also traveled with it. This most recent one has the same information as the second one, and was just issued in Oct 2017. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to get it back to the original "male," or else if I have any other options to not have to pay for a new passport when I *just* got one, especially considering the name change would have been free. 

Any advice would be awesome. I appreciate your taking the time to view the post. </span></div></div>

The complex has known serious crime issues (years’ worth). I no longer feel safe and want an option to leave if I want to sooner/before our lease ends. 

——————————————-

Aside from the normal loud neighbors, bad pet owners, shit and pee in places they shouldn’t be... My boyfriend and I gave our new apartment the benefit of the doubt even after the plethora of negative reviews, including break ins and cars being stolen from the garage. 

15 days after moving in, we discovered that our storage unit got broken into on 12/5/19.  We don’t know if it occurred that day, or the day before, but this is when we discovered that someone broke the handle to get into our storage unit. The shittiest part is that the lock/handle itself is provided by the apartment complex and they told us that they are aware of it as an issue (aka, it easily breaks).

Burglar stole my luggage (with a bunch of my lingerie, lol), and damaged my bf’s storage box. 

A police report was filed, I also filed a claim with my insurance, and, of course notified the leasing office to their horror. When we went in there, our leasing guy said, “THIS IS THE THIRD ONE.” Not sure if he meant that day, that week, or this month...

The handle was replaced the same-day. We asked if we can have our front door replaced too because our storage and front door keys are the same, but they said NOPE!

This really upset me because I inquired about these negative reviews to the leasing consultant I’ve been dealing with from the beginning and was told (I have emails) that the robberies are, essentially, not happening anymore, and that it’s not “that bad.” 

After the break in, it has been a can of worms. I find out my neighbor next door had his car broken into. Then today, I see that a girl wrote a review after my review (Yelp) reporting that her storage got broken into as well, AND her car also got stolen... She lives on the top/4th floor and I live on the first floor. 

Like I said, these are known issues.  You can scroll through Yelp. I did the math and at least 15% of the Yelp reviews talk about the robberies. 

A couple of things I want to note are:

1) This complex is about 3 years old and have gone through at least 2 other property managements 

2) Literally anyone can get in here. Common areas are not protected, we have a big back gate, and side gates. I saw someone hop that side gate last weekend cause it’s pretty low. They leave the back gate open when it’s not supposed to (even over night). We have fob keys but not all the common area require them, such as the elevator. Common outside areas also do not have enough lighting. Children play in the alley where the back gate is at!!

3) Our “secured” gate to the parking garage was broken for almost two weeks (it was broken when our storage unit got broken into). It was just fixed today. 

4) Around/before my storage got broken into, management sent an email about starting to install a security watchtower, which includes a lot of cameras, and some alert of system that can defect heat signatures. They just began construction of it this Monday based on their email. They only currently have cameras near the amenities. 

5) I researched the actual management company and discovered that other properties they manage (outside CA) report the same issues (security sucks).

6) My neighborhood has a relatively high crime rate. The government publication is public and shows the crime rates from January to August of this year (this is the most recent one this year).

I’ve done enough research (or so I think) that talks about Civil Laws here in CA and that it is the landlord’s duty to take reasonable measures to protect tenants from foreseeable crimes...

However, I’ve read our lease several times over and all I see is, “fuck you, we’re not liable for anything.”

I just feel misled and I’m still angry. More importantly, I think there should be  legal consequences and/or legal loopholes. 

I don’t care if they’re making changes now after years have gone by with the thefts and robberies. Only my bf has spoken with the leasing people here since the break in.  Bf said people in the leasing office were very anxious towards him since they all saw my Yelp review (i’m a “Yelp elite,” but that doesn’t matter) and said that corporate is aware of it as well. 

So, yeah, I just want to know if there is a loophole around my 15 month lease because 15 months is too fucking long especially after they lost me as a resident two weeks after moving in. And yes, I am an idiot for signing such as a long lease. $2k+ isn’t worth what I’ve experienced so far.</span></div></div>

Because in 12 years they have never lived together, sure they were married and visited one another, but over time it just stopped, so after 3-4 years of visiting eachother on weekends+ going on vacations together (my father paying for her) she just stopped visiting, had better stuff to do, they still talked on the phone every weekend, but that soon stopped aswell, at the moment they have contact every 3-4 months per phone, and she just asks how everything is going and what not. So after 12 years of marriage my father had enough and told her he wanted a divorce. 

You may think it may come from both sides, but here's the weird part. She absolutely refused to move in with him and always told him later, in 2 years when this and this is done, 2 years later she said in 4 years, etc etc, until now. She told him to sell his house (worth quite alot) and that she wouldn't move in with him (meaning she wouldn't want him to buy an appartment for her next to an appartment for him, she doesn't actually want to move in) unless he sold his new house (and got rid of his dog with it aswell). 

**And then!** when he finally tells her he wants the divorce, she is shocked (they talk over the phone each 3-4 months..) that he wants it and says she is quite happy as it is now and doesn't want it to change, also her first reaction after hearing this was to yell "You cheated me with the marriage contract!" (He made it, so that she wouldn't get his money when they'd split), which obviously reveals that she was just going for his money all along.

Now my 72 year old father atm living in **Hungary** (but actually came from central europe) with diabetes and his bones cracking, is left there standing, wondering what he can do, because she refuses to sign the paper, go to court or do anything, she said she won't move. 
He now is planning on scheduling an appointment with a lawyer, but it would really help to know what he could actually do? Does he have to go to court? Will it cost him much, what could be possible outcomes? He's really uncertain about it, and I really want to help, but I'm a measly engineering student with no clue on general laws.

I hope the wall of text didn't bury any responses, thank you in advance.

**TL;DR** Father marries Woman, after 12 years of not living together finally realizes she only wants his money, he has a contract, she refuses to sign the papers or show up. What should he do?</span></div></div>

So in turn the birth date was wrong on my ticket filing and got a court summoning, but it was for the minors(idk what to call it sorry lol). So I went to pay my ticket off on the day that the ticket had told me to pay it off by, but they told me I had to show up in court because technically in the citation I was 13 years old behind the wheel making an illegal u-turn. They ended up fixing the date of birth in the filing for the citation and moved the court date to a later date. 

Is there any way I can get out of paying to ticket using the wrong date of birth to my advantage? Like I say that it wasn’t me and I just let them fix the paper work because I’m a naive 19 year old that thinks the adults know what’s best? Or is it not worth the shot?</span></div></div>

I've been out as a trans guy for around 2 years and things usually go smoothly as bullying and that stuff, but schools have never really been great with bathroom/ locker room policies. I know that these laws are complicated but I'm just looking for pointers. 

Since the beginning of the school year, I have been told I am not allowed to use the boys restroom and must use the girls. I told the staff (guidance and principals) that I am, under no circumstances, using the girls facilities. They have no gender neutral/ disabled one stall restrooms in the school accept for the library. The library is far away from most of my classes through the day and it is very dysphoric when I walk in/ out of the library just to pee.

I've resulted to try my best to not use the bathroom through the school day. I usually have nothing to eat the whole school day (7 hours) and go home nauseus, tired and with a throbbing headache. It gets worse when I participate in after school activities, as I can be at school for over 14 hours and will not eat anything or go to the bathroom in an effort to not get dirty looks when I need to pee.

Sidenote, but I have also been called the wrong name on multiple occasions by substitute teachers (my teachers know my pronouns and my name and respect that) but that results in me being outed to my fellow peers that thought I was just a cisgender guy. The school said I, by myself, have to go to the administrations office 5 miles away from the school and talk with them as there is nothing they can do.

Is there anything I can do to get better policies because the staff at the school has done nothing to help.</span></div></div>

They claimed in the advertisement and selling of the card that it has 4GB of usable VRam, but people have proven that it only has 3.5GBs and is causing performance issues or lack there of extra performance.

Nvidia has claimed in tweets and posts on their forums that this was Intended and the card works exactly as they said it would. They also said that they will not release and drivers specifically for the card to help fix this problem.

I am wondering what legal action if any can be done in this situation. Is this false advertising, fraud, or any type of illegal activity that they can be held accountable for? How would someone go about this?

I should start off by saying that I live in Texas. About a year ago my wife cheated on me and left our son with her mother in the virgin islands; during this time I had a job up until around August when I got laid off. I went back home (I was prior military) to Virginia for some time and recently came back here to Texas. I checked my mail and I had something for child support; I missed the case and now I am behind in child support like $966 or something close to that. The only thing I saw was a paper dating Dec 2, 2017 with those numbers. I couldn't call them to ask about it because they are closed until monday, but I wanted to ask some questions here because my mind is eating me alive right now. 

I currently do not have a job and I plan to get one soon, but currently I have just been living with a buddy and been getting help from my family for my car bill. My question is what can I really do now that I owe child support? I am pretty confused because as far as I know she doesn't even have our son he is still with her mother. Another question I wanted to ask, is it possible to have child support dropped somehow if she agrees? I haven't really done anything wrong to her and until we stopped talking (like July time frame) her and I weren't really fighting or anything, so I believe I can talk to her to drop it if it's possible at least until I get on my feet.

 Thanks for any help in advance. </span></div></div>

Me &amp;amp; my team of 7 and growing have founded a blockchain based startup here in the united states. We are launching our crowdsale soon that we’ve been working on for the past 8 months. We would like to launch a utility token to be available to be purchased by US citizens as this is the largest market and we are seeking legal advice, but all of the firms in the space are asking $50K-$100K to represent our company and considering this industry is approaching $1 Trillion that is very reasonable, but still out of our budget currently. If any securities attorneys are reading this, we are willing to exchange equity in our company for deeper consultation. As of today I would like to know if we would be safe selling this token to US citizens .. here is the following information I believe is important in determining this. 


1. We do not have an MVP. We will be using this crowdsale to fund the development. 

2. Our token is not an ‘investment contract’ , users will NOT be paid in any sort of dividends or tokens for owning our token. 

3. We are not promising any types of gains by investing in us. 

4. The incentive to using our token within our marketplace is that users get to avoid fees, and they can stake the token to bid on advertisements within the website. User with the highest stake earns the promotion for a set period of time. Other than this there are no incentives to using our token. 



According to the latest SEC press releases it seems we are safe, but I’d thought I would double check here to make sure. 

We are very appreciative of any feedback!

Thanks.

During this time, I was also really struggling with a chronic health condition/disability. I manage it pretty well now, but at times it flares up and can cause serious back pain and make it difficult to stand. But I have seen countless doctors and all of them say that I am fine and this condition is unfortunately just something I have to live with. 

A few weeks into working at my new job, I had a flare up and asked my then-manager if I could sit down for a minute. When I came back out, he told me he was going to call an ambulance. I tried to explain to him my condition and begged him not to do that, as I couldn't afford an ambulance. He told me that it wouldn't be an issue, and that he had called our GM who confirmed that the company would pay for my bills under workman's comp and I would be fine if I just told the people in the ER that it was a work related incident.

He continued to blow things way out of proportion and I started to panic, he made me think I could be having appendicitis and that I needed urgent medical attention. I have high anxiety and truly believed him in the moment. The compromise was that I would leave work immediately and drive to the ER myself, so that he wouldn't call the ambulance. I did. I spent a few hours in the ER, they ran a bunch of tests and, of course, found nothing wrong.

When I came back to work the next day, my other manager told me that nope, the company would not be helping me whatsoever with the bills and I should never have been told that. She told me I'd be totally fine because hospitals don't bill you right away (as if I was a braindead moron who had never been to a hospital before, thanks for the heads up genius). The manager who caused all of this gave me a half-assed apology and quit the next day, because apparently corporate scolded him a little for the incident.

Anyways, months later, I've just gotten back the bills. They are thousands of dollars. Is there anything I can do concerning corporate? I was told by my superior that they would cover my expenses, just to be told that was all a bunch of nonsense to force me to go to the hospital when it was completely unnecessary.</span></div></div>

Big semi in left hand turn lane. light turns green I go and next thing I know I am hit by the truck spun out in intersection. Hit on my drivers side quarter panel. A police officer was nearby and comes and takes info for his report. The whole time the truck driver is apologizing for being in the wrong lane and not being able to make the turn not knowing there was two turn lanes how he was lost etc just keeps talking and talking. There is a witness who states the truck was stopped and I turned into the truck. And the truck driver says this as well. This is impossible. I know this turn very well I know there are two turn lanes and make a point to look for the dashed lines indicating lanes and make sure to stay in my lane.  The police report has my side of the story that the truck came out of his lane and struck my car. The report has my story and the truck drivers which matches the witnesses story. The report says we both failed to maintain our lanes. But I know it can't be what happened. 

Since I don't have coverage with my insurance to pay for my damaged car there isn't much they can do. I contacted the truck drivers insurance company and they say I was cited which I was not and that the story the truck driver said is the one they believe and they denied I had any claim.  My insurance denied the claim of the tiny damage to the truck based on lack of evidence I caused the accident.

I don't know what to do next. Do I just call back the truck drivers insurance again and explain myself again?  Do I file a case in small claims court? How do I prove to the truck drivers insurance company that the truck driver caused the accident? I am in UT</span></div></div>

Right now there is a typed and signed document that states my dad is suppose to have my sisters Tuesday and Thursday nights. The 16yo is refusing to go and the 12 year old comes home in tears every time. Tonight she came home (instead of sleeping at his house) very upset. After a lot of arguing and empty legal threats we convinced him she could stay home for the night. My mom was barely involved in any of this, she doesn't have the to will power to stand up to him. What can he legally do if my sisters refuse to sleep at his house? They are willing to see him, but they don't want to sleep at his house. What can my mom do now to help my sisters come up with a better situation? Any advice would be helpful, thanks.</span></div></div>

Please forgive me if this post is going to be a little on the rambling side, but I'm still a bit shaken up by what just happened. I'll try to detail all the facts, but please ask me any relevant question that I might not address in this post.

Background:

* Me: 34 y/o woman, professional, lodging a room in a shared house for a fixed term of 3 months (ending 31st Aug 2016) in Cambridge, UK. I have a written contract for those three months and a "verbal/email agreement" with the landlady to give me a brief heads up (we agreed on 24 hours) for when someone would be coming to look at the room I'm currently renting. 

Situation: 

* I am currently on garden leave, awaiting to move to a new city to pick up a new job there, so I am mostly at home or wandering about the city, organising stuff for the move.
* Today I was at home, since it's a hot day I decided to stay indoors and relax for a while. I was in my room, headphones on, lounging on the bed in my pajamas eating a sandwich, not a worry in the world. UNTIL TWO UNKNOWN MEN LITERALLY WALKED INTO MY ROOM UNANNOUNCED. Turns out there was a planned house showing (landlady delegated these events to an agency, whose guy had the key to the house - also, I do not have the key to my own room) and NO ONE TOLD ME ANYTHING. Knowing Cambridge and being quite good at judging people's intentions quite fast, I immediately understood what had happened and played it cool, but no lie, for more than a second I thought they were burglars, or worse. I calmly explained to the agent that it was not his fault (he profusely apologised for the intrusion of privacy, he was very nice and I'm 110% sure he was being honest in saying that he didn't expect anyone to be home since he had been told it was an open house showing, which WAS NOT), but then my nerves got the best of me and I sent a scathing email to the landlady telling her that she had crossed a HUGE line, putting not only my right to privacy but also my (and my possessions') safety (I know, I'm 36891213% sure the guys who go looking at houses do not have bad intentions, but it's the principle behind it) at risk. I ccd the other tenants, the property manager and the letting agency.

Now, since you're the experts here, who is in the right? What happened? Should I just expect this to happen again because she has the complete right to do so?

Apologies again if this sounds a bit jumbled, but they spooked me quite a lot.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion you might provide.


EDIT: I am Italian, so I know a bit about rental/lodging laws in Italy but I haven't the faintest (nor the ability to fully comprehend them) about British laws.</span></div></div>

Later that night, her father and boyfriend came to my house, (the address was supplied by the car owners mother who is a courier and had previously delivered to my address and recognised me,) and were very intimidating towards my girlfriend (I was not home), threatening to return and call the police and were generally very agressive towards her. They were not exactly small guys but my girlfriend is tiny, and she did indeed feel threatened.

Anyway, they demanded my information which eventually was provided to them, and the car owner is now looking into making a claim against me, but I believe she plans on claiming for damage which I did not cause to her car (she says there is a dent but I am sure I did not dent it). I have pictures of her car but she does not have pictures of mine.

My question is, if she does decide to claim against me rather than settle it personally (which I would prefer), how can I ensure I am not mugged off over the damage caused?

Also, is it okay for her mother to hand out my address to other members of her family?

I am posting on behalf of my mother. Located in Santa Clara county, California. 

To begin, she purchased her house at the end of 2007, roughly 3 years before she and my stepdad even started dating. My stepfather and mother married in 2011 and things were mostly smooth sailing. My stepfather was a huge role model to me growing up, and without him I wouldn’t be part of college athletics like I am today. 

This August my stepfather was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. He began to deteriorate rapidly and was in and out of the hospital for October. At this point he stopped chemo (which was why he was in the hospital from not eating) and began to recover at home for November. Instead of a funeral, he opted for a celebration of life, while he was still around. Roughly 80 people attended on Nov. 16 to see my stepfather and pay their respects. That morning we signed the will with him and multiple people present. We have videos of him from that day in which he is coherent, moving around, and competent. 

He did fall at the end of the day trying to move a table without his cane. Silly I know, but he was a stubborn bastard. 

On November 25, he took a sudden turn for the worse and began to lose mental faculties. At which point he was placed into a medically induced coma by hospice care under a program they called “intensive critical home care.”

On Dec. 1, he passed away. We lost a great man that day, and it was unfortunate that he went so soon. The following weekend my stepsister’s husband and her stepfather came to collect some dishes and collectibles she wanted that weren’t covered in the will. 

Now on to the dirty stuff. Today we received the following letter in the mail:

[Letter we received](https://imgur.com/q41M5hj)

To begin, this letter was from my stepsisters stepfather, a real estate agent. Now on to my questions:

1. The house was solely in my moms name, and my stepfather never made any payments on it. Does my stepsister have any claim to any value of the house? 

2. My stepfather left behind a car, which was in both my mom’s and my stepfather’s name. The car was listed in the will as being left to me. Does she have any claim to the car? 

3. This letter seems like a bogus scare tactic, is that correct in assuming it’s a bunch of BS? 

I appreciate all of your time and thanks in advance.

Edit 1: we have a meeting setup with an attorney that was recommended to us. We meet with them on Tuesday to hopefully draft a return letter.

Right before the corona-virus my mother and father were having a verbal dispute that was completely fine but I walked on the scene and said some stuff and my father went to swing at me; this is not the first time he has done something like this. My sister and her boyfriend were around the corner and heard/saw some of what was happening and ran in to stop my dad we held him down because he was still trying to, and somewhat successfully throwing punches at his kids/kid's SO (ages are as follows me:16 sister:18 bf:19 dad:60 mom:54) my mom ran and grabbed a gun afraid her children were going to get hurt. Once she grabbed the gun she aimed it at the wall near my father. as soon as the gun was at her side I ran over grabbed the gun and dismembered it, we all ran out and after a yelling match and a game of hot potato with gun parts we ran away. My sister, then afraid of our father's mental and physical wellbeing so she called in a welfare check my mom and sister's boyfriend get arrested for domestic assault in the first degree and battery in the first degree separately.

By the time I found out, the "relationship" was already over. I texted him to tell him I was pregnant, he said it's impossible because he's sterile. *eyeroll* He was a turd anyway, so I dropped it. I applied for and received assistance from the state, including health insurance, food stamps, and WIC. I had my son in 2008. My name is the only one on the birth certificate. A few months later, the state asked me to provide contact information for the presumed father so they could pursue child support on my behalf. Before doing so, I looked the guy back up (I had no contact info beyond his name and email address anymore) and emailed him with this information. He flipped out, cursing and saying his wife better not find out because they were trying to start a family, yadda yadda. Incidentally, that's why I stopped seeing him, because I found out I was the "other woman." I emailed back, saying that I'd drop it if he agreed to never contact me again and if he agreed to not pursue paternal rights to my child. He did, and I haven't heard from him since. I declined to provide the state with information and never pursued support myself. I just didn't want the hassle or any connection with him whatsoever, even if support was provided with no contact. Dad thought I was nuts. Mom thought I was making the right decision. 

It's been almost 10 years, and I've moved from MO to OK and now I live in FL. Despite his "verbal" agreement to not pursue rights, it's always been in the back of my mind that he might one day change his mind, and try to get back in our lives. I still have the email address I used, but I'm not sure if those emails still exist. 

I'm about to get married, but we haven't had an in-depth adoption discussion, yet. He's not dismissing it out of hand, but he's the kind of guy who thinks through every scenario's possible outcomes before coming to a decision. It's on our minds because my son is getting treatment for ADHD, and the office we go to will not allow him to make any decisions or bring him to appointments without me, regardless of what I say. He'd consult me before making those decisions, anyway. 

I've been operating on the premise that if he's not on the BC, he hasn't contacted us in almost 10 years (beyond an accidental run in at Target when my son was 6 months old. He was there with who I assume was his wife and their 8ish month old daughter. So not only was I the other woman, she was pregnant when we did the do. The panic on his face at the time was, I'm not ashamed to admit, delicious.), and had never provided any support whatsoever, that any case he tried to build would have been worth less than the paper it was printed on, even if I can't find those emails.

Do I really have anything to worry about? Also, if my future husband does decide to adopt my son, would we have to make an attempt to contact the bio-dad for an official relinquishment of rights? Is there anything else I haven't considered from a legal perspective?

Thanks. </span></div></div>

As with most high schools these days, our school is undergoing a “juul epidemic” which has, for most teens across the nation, been an ongoing joke. So I thought it would be funny to poke fun at “the juuling” and made [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/F3Mi4SY) this flyer and hung them around the school, students hang things up all the time. A lot of students thought it was funny. 

Today I was buying my prom ticket and the lady selling them pulled out a folder, and pulled out one of the flyers after seeing my school ID and asked if I’d made it. I stuttered and she said again, this time more firmly “did you make it or did someone else make it.” I told her I made it. I believe that was a mistake. She asked me a bit about it and I just told her it was an inside joke amongst the students. She sold me the ticket and i was on my way, this was about an hour ago. 

I am a senior in high school and graduating in less than a month. I have never really “been in trouble” in this kind of way, just like detention or ISS for being late or breaking the dress code, but never anything serious. This is a large public high school in Atlanta. 

My friend says I won’t get in trouble over a flyer, but I’m not going to lie I am quite worried. I’m afraid what i believed to be a harmless joke may get me in serious trouble. I’m afraid of the school searching my phone, so I deleted any drug-related pictures (yeah this is just nicotine but still they might use other things against me) and messages off my phone, I have nothing on me or in my bag that could get me into trouble. I’m 18, will the school contact my parents and tell them to do something like search my room, or not allow me to attend college? 

Mostly I just feel like an idiot but I really can’t afford the consequences and I’m really freaking out to be honest. 

Tl;dr- made a satirical flyer for prom queen and may get in trouble for it</span></div></div>

Hello,
My coworkers and I signed a contract that had a lot of undefined terms to which we all interpreted differently than our boss. It is my understanding that when a contract does not specify something interpretation belongs to that of the signer, correct? For example in the contract it says "week" which all of us took to mean 7 days rather than a 5 day work week. Also, there was no clause about accruing vacation, but a clause about our trial period ending after 3 months which one person took as "all vacation days are available after those three months" especially since no accruement were listed on our checks and the spaces for that was blank. While our employer says because non of us have been full time (which is incorrect to begin with) we are just out of the know that these things are standard in all work contracts at companies and dont need to be specified. Does anyone have any advice on where I can find CA or federal laws about interpreting contracts?</span></div></div>

I've recently lost a bike that was tied to my balcony (I'm on the first floor). This happened while I was asleep at night, during the shelter-in-place period. It's almost impossible for someone to reach and grab from the outside of the balcony - someone has to have jumped over the fence and then grab it. I do live in a gated community (so it's gated, and then I have a 6ft tall wall around the balcony). I don't feel safe living in this unit anymore so I have tried to contact the leasing office to transfer to another unit but they have failed to respond back to me for 3 weeks.

Due to increase in thefts and car break-ins due to economy pitfall, I'm pretty confident more thefts will happen. What really concerns me is though there is no surveillance system to the gate of the community, and the balcony door is very.. balcony-door-ish. Meaning it has a huge square-glass in the middle that anyone can break in. It was not really a problem when I moved in, but now I actually experienced burglary, I do feel little unsafe and the leasing office has done no effort to do accommodate. Actually, even before trying to accommodate, they have ignored my calls and when they picked up and said the manager will get back to me, she never did. I don't even know if she got the message tbh. Can this be suitable for uninhabitable situation? I'm ultimately trying to break the lease without penalty and move out of this community.</span></div></div>

I'm a graphic designer in Texas and I'm revising/writing my own terms and conditions. While, there may be a couple of sections that I'm not 100% certain about, I really way to double-check that this section on payment schedule is worded in a way that makes sense and doesn't have any weird holes.

* Prior to project commencement, client will pay one-third of the total project costs in the form of a down payment. The client will pay the second one-third of the total project costs to the designer at the mid-point of the project timeline, and the remaining one-third of the total project costs to the designer upon completion of the project. Original artwork and production files will only be supplied to the client once the total project costs have been paid in full. Should the client require work to be completed sooner than the originally agreed upon schedule, a rush fee of 50% of the remaining, or required, work may be applied. 

Thank you so much in advance for any help! It's genuinely appreciated.</span></div></div>

My girlfriend has signed a lease about 6 months ago where the address is X. X is a private dorm. 

However, she was placed in what they call a townhouse, that's essentially a two story house I guess that's physically connected to the main building. However her townhouse is not accessible from within the building located at X. She has to cross a back alley to get to it. Her real address is Y, the private residence even told her her mail should be delivered at Y. 

Is it possible to cancel the lease based on the fact that it says she should be living at X, but that she lives at Y? If not, is there any recourse to canceling a lease?</span></div></div>

I was renting a room out of X's house until things got very sour between us after the death of an animal. I ended our contract early in May 2013, paid move out fees detailed in the contract, and left. In paying the move out fees I made a slight error on the check and X contacted me saying the bank may not accept it and I'd be liable for fees that are associated with bouncing a check. I went to my bank, had the check voided, and mailed another check. X cashed this check in June 2013.

December 2014 comes around, a year and a half later, and I'm looking at my financial statements and come to find a check had been cashed that I don't remember writing. I called my bank and they said it was the voided check. She cashed it right before the holidays. Their policy (Navy Federal) is to only void a check for 180 days, after which it becomes stale-dated. However, Navy Federal does not have a policy against cashing stale-dated checks. USAA, X's bank, does, but won't refund the amount because they were not the ones who released the funds.

My question is: If I sue in small claims court, is there anything you guys can think I can reference that will build my case? I have statements from both banks saying the check should not have been cashed. I have a copy of the contract that details the move out fees. I have a copy of both checks that detail what they are paying (I know what is written on the check and what it is paying for is not legally binding)

Thank you and have a good day. </span></div></div>

My company has put me on furlough. It has been about 2 months now. I’m not confident that I will be brought back, so I am looking at other options.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that I will be able to jump into another job and instantly start making as much as I am on currently on UI. Don’t get me wrong I AM making less on UI than I make at work. My furloughed position pays us way more than the market value of similar positions. And doesn’t really help me qualify for a higher paying job somewhere else. At the end of the day, I was going to have this problem anyway if I quit or got laid off. The pandemic has just forced it upon me earlier than anticipated. What sucks is, I’m not really “qualified” to do much of anything else that pays well except sales.

I am wondering if I would be able to continue to receive some benefits if I start work at another company where I would be making significantly less. The reason I would be making less is because it will likely be a sales position that takes time to develop. 

I’m scared to make the jump right now, but I think it’s a bad idea to just bet on me being allowed to return to my furloughed job.

I guess basically my question is: what happens when I notify DOL that I have started another job and am making a little money. (Less than I get from UI.) I live in Alabama.</span></div></div>

I sell other stuff on Amazon and started doing Merch as just a way to make more money.  It required more time/effort than I wanted to give so I didn't really put that much in and kinda just forgot about it.

I still have designs up and all in all have sold about 30 shirts.

I ended up checking to see if I had ever been paid for them and I have not.

I opened a case and was dragged around for 2-3 weeks before they replied "you'll be paid in next payment cycle".  It's been about 10 days and still not paid.

I don't care about the money because it's probably about $50 total but I do care about not getting fucked by Amazon.

Do I have any options here other than to just wait and hope they send me the money?

Thanks</span></div></div>

I was just dropping off my girlfriend from work she got off at 10:00 PM she got home probably around 10:20. We stopped to get some fast food for some dinner and we parked inside of her condo complex in one of the public parking spaces. We're just sitting there eating, minding our own business when a lady comes out from her back door to come yell at us about idling and my car being loud. My car is pretty loud it's a 2004 Neon SRT-4 with a modified exhaust but we were also parked completely legally. Not revving the engine or driving loudly squealing tires and all. Just sitting there idling. After she's done complaining we shrug it off and eat for another 10-15 minutes before we finish and I take her home which is on the opposite side of where we were parked and she's actually across the street neighbors with my girlfriend. Now I've never had a problem with anyone regarding noise in this complex mainly cause I don't drive like an asshole at 11 at night. So this lady must've just moved in. But while she was getting out I noticed the lady looking through her window and she appeared to be on the phone which inspired me to ask this question. I can only imagine she was calling the cops but I really want to know if what I did was illegal and if I could have been cited for it. I'm familiar with my states exhaust laws (Nevada) I was very meticulous in reading up on them before I installed an aftermarket system and there is close to none. There is a law limiting decibels emitted from an exhaust but it's not heavily enforced whatsoever and even then that's when the engine is at like half RPM or something like that. So was I in the wrong? Or can I tell the lady to bug off next time. Either way she needs to get used to it cause my girlfriend can't drive yet and I'm exclusively her ride basically anywhere. To and from work (Fridays and Saturdays we close at 12 so she's home around 12:45 after cleaning) and to and from school (I'm responsible for picking up multiple people and I pick her up around 6:30) if anyone has any knowledge on this please let me know.</span></div></div>

I proceeded straight through an intersection with a green light and had the right of way. It was an intersection allowing left hand turns on green if it was a circle. There was a sign next to the light stating that you yield on green. He entered the intersection, turning left, and we hit each other on the front corner of our cars, making it unclear to everyone who was at fault apparently.   
After the accident he said I ran a red light and he had a "green arrow" giving him the right of way. The cops issued no citation to either of us and the cops plus the insurance companies didn't try to gather evidence or video footage to prove who was at fault. They left it as a "he said she said." No witnesses stayed to give a statement. His insurance company denied my claim.   


I have now contacted a lawyer but they want to handle the case I had last year where the person admitted that day they were at fault and it's already a "win" for me as everything will be covered and taken care of.   
I'm at a loss here. I don't want to get a lawyer at all let alone a lawyer for a case that I'm already going to get a settlement for just to lose a third of what I'd be getting. I need help with this latest case and honestly don't know what I can do to prove he was lying. I stood on the street corner with a sign practically begging for witnesses and the only guy that stopped to tell me he'd witnessed it never called me.   


I need help. I've never had to deal with lawyers and I feel like I'm in a terrible situation where I'm just going to be taken advantage of and exploited. They said they'd think about taking on my second accident after they take care of the first one. What verbage do I need to use here? What language do I need to find a lawyer that's going to take care of the accident I need real help on? What things can I do myself to solve this that I'm not seeing? She said something about a Public Disclosure Something that I could file the get the footage from a gas station that said they wouldn't release the video without a warrant but even with me saying there were cameras at the intersection and the gas station she said it'd be hard to prove and was "murky" who was at fault. She instead seemed intent on spending up to $5,000 on a special witness to "reconstruct" the accident. I wouldn't post here if I wasn't desperate. This whole thing has made my life hell and I want justice. He severely hurt me, cost me thousands of dollars, and is getting away with it because of one small lie.</span></div></div>

We had lived together before without problems, but this time around things blew up.  We were married for about six months when she moved out in March 2013 and we decided on a divorce.  Considering no kids, no shared property, nothing to be divided up, I'm attempting a self-litigated (pro se) divorce, for which the forms are already organized in a packet on the SC court website.

From what I had read I know that in SC, in a no-fault divorce, we needed a year of separation without cohabitation to be completed before we could file for divorce.  I'm gearing up to file in March, but she moved back to Tahiti last year and is not responding to my emails and I don't know her address.  How am I supposed to serve her in another hemisphere when I don't know where she is?  

I'm guessing that any other way to serve her is going to be ridiculously complicated and expensive and I'm getting worried.  How would the court handle this situation?

She did, because she didn't know what was going on and didn't want to get in trouble. Later she was called down to the assistant principal's office. He proceeded to tell her he found stuff (he didn't elaborate) in her search history and called her a liar when she told him she didn't know what he was talking about. Throughout all this, no one ever called me. They still haven't, and they still have her phone. She's an honor roll student and has never been in trouble before.

Husband &amp;amp; I lived in a condo for almost 4 years til our landlady sent a move-out notice so she could fully remodel and put her family in the unit.  The only damage left when we moved was one broken mirrored sliding closet door and a 5-inch crack in the shower enclosure. The shower crack was there when we moved in but unfortunately it wasn't documented.  Mind you, the lease specified this shower couldn't be cleaned with anything but liquid soap, as anything else strips the cheap caulking and lining.

We never got a copy of the condition report when we moved in.  We requested a pre-moveout inspection that she conducted, but she didn't give us a physical itemized statement with the required Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2) language.  Instead, she texted an itemized list, including "dusty patio; dust in drawers; dust in refrigerator". It's my understanding those things can’t be on the list as they're normal wear and tear and can't be deducted from the deposit.

After moving out, she sent us a physical itemized list with two estimates--one replacing the entire shower enclosure, and the other replacing 3 mirrored sliding closet doors.  Someone from Home Depot signed the sliding door estimate, saying that they do not install single door panels. The itemized list said that the total we owe against our security deposit was "TBD" (to be determined).  Is the remaining life of an item supposed to be considered when calculating repair cost? I contacted her multiple times asking when the shower and sliding doors were initially installed, but she wouldn’t respond.

Tomorrow will be 21 days from when we vacated the premises.  Last night, she sent us an email with the 'current total' we owe, saying that we owe the full cost of replacing all 3 sliding closet doors as she's given us opportunity to repair them ourselves but we haven't done so.  She also says she'll send us her receipts within 14 days after she obtains them, and claims that the shower repair must first be approved by the HOA that doesn't meet until later this or next month.

None of this seems legal, especially considering how she violated Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2).  I went through our lease and discovered she didn't complete the "Condition of Premises" section where she was supposed to "check all that apply", including the claim that tenants agreed to the specified condition.  The only thing checked was an item specifying the shower not be cleaned with anything but liquid soap.

Are we liable for the full replacement cost of items if they were not new when we moved in?  Is she required to calculate the cost with consideration to the remaining life of the item(s)?  Is she allowed to bill us the full cost to replace 3 sliding doors when only 1 was damaged? Can she send us another bill in a month for the shower, which she thinks we're supposed to pay full cost to repair?  Our lease says that all parties involved must mediate first in the event of dispute. If she doesn't send us a valid estimate amount tomorrow, can we demand that she mediate as she's not made a good faith effort to be fair or follow the laws as specified?  I’m at my wits end with this lady.</span></div></div>

I'm finishing up my last semester at university, and when I signed for this apartment they said that the lease was for a year but there would be no problem for them to find somebody to relet to. I agreed and signed the 12-month lease, as well as paid the $250 they asked for to put me on the 'relet list', which meant that they would look for another tenant to fill the room.

That was in June. 6 months later and they still haven't found anyone to fill the room. I've been searching on Craigslist as well and haven't found anyone myself, and after talking with the landlord again she doesn't seem willing to cut any sort of deal (offered her the $250 fee mentioned above and the $655 security deposit, no dice).

Pretty sure I'm fucked here. I have absolutely no way of paying the rest of the rent amount now that loan checks have stopped, and my student employment is done with now that I'm no longer a student. Is there anything else I can do to get out of this arrangement? And if not, how can I prevent getting sued?

I feel like the ridiculous amount of time I gave them to find another tenant and the $250 fee should make this easier, but I don't know.</span></div></div>

My brother and Cathy don't have best relationship post divorce - but they split custody with their two kids and are able to mostly make things work. Cathy refuses to vaccinate their two daughters, age 6 and 3. Shirley is due in a couple months. Shirley has said she doesn't want the two daughters around the new born if they aren't vaccinated. So my brother asked for a mediation with Cathy to talk about it and she refused to sign the mediation papers and instead presented him with 'What Doctors Don't Want You Know About Vaccines' or some such thing. This is all taking place in Arizona by the way. He's not really sure what his options are. He doesn't want to just not see his daughters for like 6 months but he's not sure if there is any precedent or legal recourse that he may have to get a court order that his daughters be vaccinated.

They quit mainly due to some mild but constant tension with a few coworkers. This company has franchise locations all over the US and recently one of the other contractors (Coworker) that continued employment with the same franchise location decided to purchase a franchise of their own (also in Virginia). Jane had found employment at another company, but was recently furloughed due to the pandemic. Coworker found out and offered Jane a position with their new franchise, but soon found out that the original franchise owner (Owner) put Jane on a hiring blacklist for company X. Owner told Coworker that they could not legally disclose that Jane is on the blacklist, though Coworker told Jane anyways.

I have seen a few articles mentioning that such hiring blacklists are legal and some saying that it is not, especially if it is malicious job obstruction, which may be what this is. No one knows of any reason why Owner would have done this, other than some unknown personal grudge or an attempt to eliminate as much competition as possible. Jane did not leave without appropriate notice and seemed to be on good terms with everyone including Owner. No one has mentioned anything to Owner about knowing that Jane is on this blacklist yet to prevent Coworker from being dragged into any issues with Owner. Is this blacklisting legal in Virginia? Is there any action that Jane could take to get past this and pursue employment with Coworker?</span></div></div>

My wife and I have several kids, one of which has complex cardiac issues that have required open heart surgeries and will require more in the future. Also, because of his issues he has a shorter than normal life expectancy - sucks to say the least. I’m ashamed to admit it, but we’ve done nothing to ensure that if we both die, that the money goes to the right places, is controlled by the right people and to also ensure that should he be in a compromised state, he will have the right people making medical decisions for him as a minor. 

So my question.. is this done with a will? With a will? Where do I start with something like this? I also want directives on custody, handling of finances and so forth. Is this something that could be done through legal zoom or do I absolutely need an attorney? Trying to save as much as possible while also ensuring that this doesn’t end up in curt should something happen.

Thanks!</span></div></div>

Hoping someone might be able to provide a little bit of help with a conundrum my partner and I are having regarding the pet policy of the leasing office at the townhouse community we recently moved into. I totally appreciate that this is a pretty petty concern compared to a lot of what gets posted on here, but we thought it would be wise to reach out for advice in any case.

We had been looking for a new place for awhile and, in particular, wanted to find one that would allow for extra large dogs. We both love Great Danes and with a rescue specifically for those that have hearing and sight issues due to bad backyard breeding in our area, decided that we wanted our new place to allow for us to adopt one of the many special needs adult dogs in our area a home. We spent a lot of time searching and finally found a place that said specifically on their pet policy page on their home site that "there is no weight limit for pets." In speaking to the leasing agent about this (and a Giant Breed dog in particular) he said it wasn't an issue so long as it didn't go against their breed restrictions, and confirmed that the group that owns this property has a 65lb rule, but that it didn't necessarily need to apply at this location.

So here's where my question comes in: we had gotten all ready to foster-to-adopt a particular dog and had been in touch with the rescue. Today I went into the leasing office to discuss the process with our agent at which point he pulled out our signed contract that said "no dogs over 65lbs" in the fine print. He acknowledged that he had previously said it was ok to go above this limit, but only to the tune of 80lbs max or 100 at an absolute push if it was inconspicuous. Is there any sort of precedent here for false advertising or failing to give us accurate information when it was made clear that this was  contingent upon our signing a lease at this property? We don't have a papertrail of this communication (hindsight is 20/20 now, I know), and aren't particularly interested in strongly pursuing the matter with a lawyer. Rather, we're just wondering if there's a case to be made where we can demonstrate to the office that our leasing agent/the web advertising of this community acted under false pretences.

Thanks!</span></div></div>

I have family members who are living rent free with my dad at his home (he had a stroke in 2017 and is paralyzed on one side). They're "taking care of him". They've pawned/sold thousands of dollars worth of his things and drive his vehicle without a license. They're known drug users and they have several kids there. I don't speak with any of them and rarely talk to my dad.

A few days ago, he was hospitalized and we're not sure if he's going to make it. He has five acres of land, two mobile homes, a vehicle, and several small storage buildings on the property. 

Now, should be die, I would assume it would all go to me (I'm an only child). But, they've claimed several times that he's told them they can have the car, the place, and all sorts of other things. The problem is that I don't have access to his life insurance, will, titles/deeds and such to actually see what's in them. 

How do I go about obtaining this information legally in a way that could not be held against me in court? And is there any way that I could take power of attorney in this situation and have them removed from the home and him put into a proper facility should he come home? Or, just... Idk... what can/should I do in general? He claims that he's of sound mind, but all it takes is having a conversation with him to realize he isn't. 

Thanks for any advice.</span></div></div>

My grandmother’s landlord is threatening eviction due to her Knick-knacks on her porch being a “fire hazard” and me living and taking care of her. Her Knick-knacks are some signs, her chairs, and general porch decor. 

My grandmother for my most part is a very active woman, she mows her lawn and takes impeccable care of her home, pays her rent, and has never once missed a rent payment. 

She pays for two people to live here and two people are still on the old contract, as my grandfather lived here prior before he passed, but my grandmother’s and landlord contract has expired. Now she has just delivered us a college ruled piece of paper that says “Vacate in thirty days”. What should we do, if anything?</span></div></div>

My brother has autism and is maybe of average intelligence, probably somewhat below average.  He struggles in a lot of things and in this story he will seem stupid due to a total lack of social skills and extreme gullibility/lack of "common sense" but he has a good heart.

He met a woman who told him she was hungry and needed a ride home.  He gave her cash for groceries then let her use his credit card to get a Lyft home.   Very kind but extremely naive.

When he gets his credit card bill he realizes she has been spending on his credit card (she obviously just has the number and info she took from the lyft ride, not the physical card itself).  He gets scared, he calls her and asks her to stop.  I dont know if he ever texted her or not (I'm going to find that out today).   She tells  him she will stop.  Then the next month, he realizes she is still spending.  He gets scared, and tries ordering a new card, thinking this will "stop" his first card.  It obviously doesn't, and she continues to rack up charges in spite of his protests.  Then and only then, he comes in tears to my mother (he was afraid she would be angry at him so he hid it ) and tells her what's going on so she was able to walk him through cancelling his card.

Altogether, she spent over $6000 on his card, spending hundreds of dollars every day.  It's a lot of money for anyone, certainly for a disabled man who is already struggling with just feeding himself and getting his medicines.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

In a just world, this seems like obvious and cruel theft.  But because he did share his credit card info willingly and permitted her to buy a lyft for herself, I know that the law is more complicated than that.  I know a credit card agreement  states that if you ever let someone use your card they are a "authorized card holder" until you both notify the bank otherwise, not sure if that includes a credit card number.  

Does he have any recourse with the police?  Small claims?   Is it civil or criminal or just the ugliness of life?</span></div></div>

Word then got around that she wasn’t hired and that she wasn’t going to be hired either. She then just quit and picked up her paycheck.  
  
Her “employer” then said that they were paying half minimum wage and not paying for the meeting because it wasn’t actually mandatory (even though it was mentioned so). The meeting still involved them getting trained and cleaning the place though.  
  
When my girlfriend challenged her employer, they told her it wasn’t actually against the law to pay below minimum wage and that since she didn’t go to the 3 day training yet, she could have just been paid nothing. Basically a kind of “I’m being nice to you so stop complaining” threat.  
  
I’ve looked online and saw that you have to pay for training interviews anyway so even if she wasn’t hired she would still have to be paid. We also looked at the Washington State and US labor laws and saw that no employer can pay below 85% minimum and only so with a learner’s certificate. Even then, half minimum is still below 85%.  
  
I’m not sure where the law stands about the meeting though.
  
She has now quit because the manager is all types of awful, but is there anything that can be done to salvage the situation and make sure her employer won’t rip off any more employees?  
  
Or is there some fine print that she is taking advantage of?  

Edit: The employee is doing this to all their employees. It’s not just my girlfriend. They have their own group chat without the managers and they’re all upset.</span></div></div>

*We are both sophomores in high school*


I would usually help my friends by giving them a hug or talking them through it but I can't. 

His parents very recently got separated and are fighting for his custody, and he says he needs to get school work done or else he will get taken away from his dad but can't find the ambition to get it done. 

He doesn't want to live with his mom and *needs* to live with his dad. 

But the thing is, I've talked to many teachers and they all say you don't need to do the work to get credit as long as you were passing in the 3rd marking period because of quarantine. 

So what I'm wondering:

How can doing schoolwork help/hurt him even though he doesn't technically need to do it? 

Can he say something in court about not being able to mentally find the ambition to do work?

If so will that help/hurt him? 

And anything else you lovely Reddit strangers can help my friend with would be GREATLY appreciated 🙏</span></div></div>

Do they only make contact in-person or would they call / write if there was a case?

Long story / details I'll try to make as easy to follow as possible while not leaving anything out:

* Girlfriend (we'll call H) has child.  Has roommate (we'll call K) - they don't get along super well, but no big fighting, everything fairly amicable.
* One night, H and I go out to dinner, K agrees to babysit
* K calls baby-daddy's sister (we'll call J) saying that we just left and he's crying.  K has not called H to say he's crying and needs here (we would have come back immediately).
* K claims that H is always drunk, on drugs, etc etc (none of which is true - drug test could be passed with ease).  Tells J and many others this.
* K moves out but continues making false claims, etc.

Days later...

*  J is a teacher.  She claims that the department of education called her and she's in trouble because K opened a DCFS report and being that she was involved and is a mandatory reporter that didn't report, she's in trouble.
* J gets a lawyer - lawyer recommends signing temporary custody to her or to baby daddy (but is even hesitant to do the latter) in order to avoid DCFS not taking kid away (although they would have no reason to even if there's an investigation)

Here's what we find fishy:

* DCFS has not contacted H this entire time (original incident was day after Christmas)
* Dept of ed SUPPOSEDLY called J on New Year's Eve (DOE website indicates they are closed then).
* As a mandated reporter, according to OCGA 19-7-5, J would only have 24 hours to report before being in trouble anyways. (But IANAL so idk if I'm reading that correctly)
* Baby daddy has also not heard anything from DCFS yet.
* All the things that J says H is doing wrong are false accusations she heard from K - never did she witness or suspect any of these things until this point, nor is there any proof or evidence that they're true.  A disgruntled ex-roommate spreading rumors is the gist.

Is there a good way to find out if there's an investigation open?</span></div></div>

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>New dataset introduced in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.nllp-1.10">Parameter-Efficient Legal Domain Adaptation</a> (Li et al., NLLP 2022) from the Legal Advice Reddit community (known as "/r/legaldvice"), sourcing the Reddit posts from the Pushshift
Reddit dataset. The dataset maps the text and title of each legal question posted into one of eleven classes, based on the original Reddit
post's "flair" (i.e., tag). Questions are typically informal and use non-legal-specific language. Per the Legal Advice Reddit rules, posts 
must be about actual personal circumstances or situations. We limit the number of labels to the top eleven classes and remove the other 
samples from the dataset.</p>
