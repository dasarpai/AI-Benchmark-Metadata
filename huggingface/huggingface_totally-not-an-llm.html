Add the adjusted movie length to the start time to get the end time on the analogue watch. Convert this to a format more traditionally used on a digital clock (24 hour format).\n4. Now, consider the extra time due to the gaining watch which we will subtract from the time we had previously calculated because the actual time in real world (on a digital clock) would be less than the time shown on the gaining analogue watch.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. Convert the movie's length to minutes: 2 hours = 120 minutes. Adding this to the 15 minutes gives a total movie length of 135 minutes.\n2. Adjust the movie's length for the fast watch: The watch gains 1 minute every hour. Thus, over 2 hours, the watch will have gained 2 minutes. But as the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long (i.e. 2.25 hrs), the watch would have gained additional 0.25 minutes (which is 15 seconds, but as clock doesn't show seconds, we can ignore this). Adding this to the movie's length gives a total of 137 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute because a watch doesn't show seconds).\n3. Add this length to the start time: 7:08 PM + 137 minutes = 9:25 PM (on the fast analogue watch).\n4.

Next, we compute how much revenue the baker generated from his sales.\n   He sold half of the pies made on day 1 which is 32/2 = 16 pies.\n   He sold two-thirds of the pies made on day 2 which is 24 * 2/3 = 16 pies.\n   So in total, the baker sold 16 + 16 = 32 pies.\n   He sells each pie for $5, so his total revenue is 32 * $5 = $160.\n\n3. Then, we determine the baker's profit, which is revenue minus costs.\n   The cost to make each pie is $2, and he made 56 pies, so his total cost is 56 * $2 = $112.\n   His profit is therefore the revenue of $160 minus the cost of $112 = $48.\n\n4. Finally, we adjust the profit total if the baker made an error\n   If the baker actually made one less pie every hour, his total pies made would be 3 pies per hour instead of 4.\n   So on day 1, he would have made 3 * 8 = 24 pies.\n   And on day 2, he would have made 3 * 6 = 18 pies.\n   Total pies would then be 24 + 18 = 42 pies.\n   His cost would now be 42 * $2 = $84.\n   He would still sell half of the pies from day 1, which is 24/2 = 12 pies.\n   And two-thirds of the pies from day 2, which is 18 * 2/3 = 12 pies.\n   In total, he would sell 12 + 12 = 24 pies.\n   His revenue would then be 24 * $5 = $120.\n   The adjusted profit would be revenue of $120 minus cost of $84 = $36.\n\nSo, when factoring in the baker's error, his adjusted profit would be $36.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The baker makes 4 pies every hour.

To identify the number of books she receives over a certain period of time, we divide the total duration (in weeks) by 3 (the frequency of receiving books). \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that Jane is continuously reading as well, and she manages to finish one book every week. \n\nIt's also mentioned that she already has 5 books to read. So, we need to take into account these aspects.\n\n\nFactor 1: Initial number of books = 5 (this is her initial reading list).\nFactor 2: Reading rate = 1 book/week\nFactor 3: Frequency of receiving new books = every 3 weeks\n\nTo reason through the problem, let's step forward in time week by week, adding a book every three weeks and subtracting a book every week.\n\nFrom the start, Jane has five weeks of reading to do (5 books to read). After those five weeks, she will have received 5/3 books (the exact number depends on whether she receives the first book at the beginning or the end of the third week, this part of the problem is vaguely defined.) If she receives a book at the end of the third week, in the first five weeks, she will receive 1 book. So at the end of 5 weeks, she is left with 1 book to read. \n\nLetâ€™s take things forward mathematically from here on -\nLet N be the total number of weeks it would take for Jane to finish all the books, including the books she will receive from the book club. \n\nAfter each cycle of three weeks, Jane will have read 3 books but received 1, which effectively reduces the total book count by 2 every 3 weeks (hence -2/3).\n\nLet's assume that it takes N weeks for Jane to finish all the books and consider the equation:\n\n5 (initial books) + N/3 (books received) - N (books read) = 0 \n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5 = 2N/3\n\nHence, N = 15/2 = 7.5 weeks\n\nSince Jane finishes a book every week and cannot finish half a book, we would round this up to 8 weeks.\n\nSo, it takes Jane 8 weeks to finish all the books.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Jane has 5 books she hasn't read yet and plans to read one book each week.

Therefore, the total of all four test scores is 85 * 4 = 340. \n\nTo find the score Mark got on the fourth test, we then subtract the total of Mark's first, second, and third test scores from 340. \nThen 340 - (70 + 80 + 90) = 100 \n\nTherefore, Mark scored 100 on his fourth test.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mark took 4 tests.

Acceleration:\nThe average speed of an object accelerating from 0 km/hr to 60 km/hr is half of the final speed.\nSo during the acceleration phase, the average speed = (0 + 60)/2 = 30 km/hr.\nGiven that the acceleration lasted for 28 minutes, we need to convert this time into hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 28 minutes = 28/60 = 0.47 hours (approx).\nThe distance covered during the acceleration phase = average speed x time = 30 km/hr x 0.47 hours = 14.1 km (approx).\n\n2. Constant speed:\nDuring the part of the journey where the train was moving at a constant speed, the distance covered = speed x time.\nTime here is 89 minutes which is 89/60 = 1.48 hours (approx).\nSo the distance covered = 60 km/hr x 1.48 hours = 88.8 km (approx).\n\n3. Deceleration:\nThe deceleration phase is similar to the acceleration phase. During deceleration, the train slows from 60 km/hr to 0 km/hr, so the average speed is again 30 km/hr.\nGiven that the deceleration lasted for 22 minutes, time in hours is 22/60 = 0.37 hours (approx).\nDistance covered during deceleration = average speed x time = 30 km/hr x 0.37 hours = 11.1 km (approx).\n\nThe total distance the train traveled is the sum of the distances covered in all three phases.\nTotal distance = distance in acceleration phase + distance at constant speed + distance in deceleration phase\nTotal distance = 14.1 km + 88.8 km + 11.1 km = 114 km.\n\nSo, the train goes a total of approximately 114 kilometers.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A train accelerates from a standing start to 60 km/h within 28 minutes, maintains that speed for the next 89 minutes, and then decelerates to a stop over the final 22 minutes.

But given the shop's schedule, we need to account for the closures.\n\nTo make the calculation, let's consider the worst case scenario:\n\n- Weekdays: there are 28 to 30 or 31 days in a month, out of which seven (every Sunday) plus one (the first day of month) would not count, giving us 20 to 23 or 24 possible weekdays in a month.\n  \nHowever, in calculating for a worst-case scenario (meaning we're assuming you're the most unlucky and every possible rest day falls within your 28-day period), we'll consider the shop only opens 20 days in a month.\n\nNow let's divide the number of flavors (28) by our worst case number of days, which is 20 days. \n\n28 / 20 = 1.4\n\nGiven that the answer is not a whole number, you need to round upâ€”meaning in this worst-case scenario, you would need to take two months. \n\nThis is the maximum number of months it will take you. However, depending on how the days fall and when you start, you could finish in less time.\n  \nSo your final answer here is it could take up to two months to try all these flavors.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;An ice cream shop has 28 flavors. If you want to try each flavor only once, how many days will it take you if you try one flavor per day, but the shop is closed every Sunday and on the first of each month?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You are a problem-solving assistant.

This means that for every 25 minutes (20 minutes of work + 5 minutes of break), the typist is actually typing for 20 minutes. \n\nDivide 120 by 25 to find out how many 25-minute intervals are in 2 hours. This equals 4.8 intervals. \n\nSince we can't really have a fraction of an interval, let's round this down to 4 because the typist won't have enough time to complete the fifth 25-minute interval (20 minutes of typing + 5 minutes of break).\n\nSo, the total typing time is 4 intervals multiplied by 20 minutes of typing, which equals 80 minutes of typing.\n\nNow, if the typist types 60 words per minute, and they're typing for 80 minutes, multiply those numbers together to find the total number of words typed. \n\nSo, the calculation should be 80 (minutes) * 60 (words/minute)\n\nFinal Answer: The typist will be able to type 4,800 words in this time frame.&quot;},&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If a professional typist can type at a steadily maintained speed of 60 words per minute, and assuming that this typist works for two hours straight with brief breaks of 5 minutes after every 20 minutes, how many words can he type in this time frame?&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You are a problem-solving assistant.

12 - 3 (chocolate chip) - 4 (oatmeal raisin) = 5 (sugar cookies)

Then, we need to calculate the remaining number of each type of cookie after some were eaten or given away:

- chocolate chip: 3 initially - 2 eaten = 1 remaining

As the train leaves at 5 PM and arrives at 8 PM, that makes for a 3-hour journey. 

However, we must consider the stops that the train made during that journey. It stopped at station C for 15 minutes and at station D for 10 minutes.

To calculate the exact travel time that is not spent at stops, we subtract the time spent at the stops from the total journey time. Doing so, we get the following:

Total duration of journey = 3 hours (or 180 minutes)
Time spent at stops = 15 minutes (station C) + 10 minutes (station D) = 25 minutes

Now, subtract the time spent at stops from the total journey time:

Exact travel time (excluding stops) = Total duration - Time at stops
= 180 minutes - 25 minutes 
= 155 minutes

So, the total duration of the journey is 3 hours, and the exact travel time between the source station and the destination, excluding the time taken at intermediary stops, is 155 minutes (or 2 hours and 35 minutes).</span></div></div>

The problem states that half the chickens lay eggs on odd days and the other half on even days. 

It does not specify whether Wednesday falls on an odd or even day, but we can split the solution into two scenarios:

1. If the Wednesday falls on an odd day, then the chickens that lay eggs on odd days will lay eggs. From the problem, we know that half of the 20 chickens lay eggs on odd days, which would be 20/2 = 10 chickens.

2. Similarly, if the Wednesday falls on an even day, then the chickens that lay eggs on even days will lay eggs. This again is half the chicken population which would also be 20/2 = 10 chickens.

Therefore, without specific information about the date of the Wednesday in question, we can say that 10 chickens lay eggs on a Wednesday.</span></div></div>

Then, to check if there is an equal number of monkeys in each social group, we divide the total number of monkeys by the number of social groups. There are 3 social groups and 16 monkeys in total, so 16 divided by 3 equals a little over 5. This means that there isn't an equal number of monkeys in each group since you can't have a fraction of a monkey in a group.

The problem seems to have a contradiction since it first states there is an equal amount of monkeys in each group but later the calculations don't line up with that statement. It's possible there is a mistake in the problem. However, based on the information given, we can confidently say that there are 16 monkeys in total at the zoo.

The car takes two 15-minute breaks over a period of 3 hours.

15 minutes = 0.25 hours.

So, two 15-minute breaks = 0.5 hours (since 0.25 hr * 2 = 0.5 hr)

Therefore, if the car drives for 3 hours in total and takes a 0.5 hour break, it drives non-stop for 2.5 hours (since 3 hr - 0.5 hr = 2.5 hr)

Next, we'll determine how far the car travels while driving. 

The car drives at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Given that speed = distance / time, distance is therefore speed * time.

So, distance = 50 miles per hour * 2.5 hours = 125 miles.

The car deviates off course a total of 2 miles every time it stops. Given it stops twice, the deviation is 2 miles * 2 = 4 miles.

Finally, the total distance the car travels is the sum of the distance it travels while driving and the distance it deviates off course.

Total distance = 125 miles + 4 miles = 129 miles.

So, the car will travel 129 miles in 3 hours accounting for the time it veers off course during its two 15-minute breaks.</span></div></div>

He found 5 seashells a day for 7 days, which means he found 5*7=35 seashells in total.

However, every second day, half of his seashells were washed away by the tide. This happened 7/2=3.5 times, but since we are talking about days, we can consider that the half-only happened actually on 3 days since a half day does not exist. Now letâ€™s calculate how many seashells are left after the tide washes away, day-by-day.

Firstly, on the first day, Pete found 5 seashells. On the second day, he found another 5, but then the tide took away half of his 10 seashells, leaving him with 5 seashells. On the third and fourth days, the same process happened: Pete found another 10 seashells over these two days, but then the tide took half of his 15, leaving him with 7.5, but we can consider this as 7 since he can't have a half of a seashell. On the fifth day, Pete found the usual 5, making 12 seashells in total. On the sixth day, he found another 5, but then the tide took half of his 17 seashells, leaving him with 8.5, but again we can consider this as 8. On the seventh day, he found another 5 making it a total of 13 seashells.

So, Pete has now 13 seashells.</span></div></div>

And each cat has 2 toys, so if you multiply the number of cats by the number of toys each cat has, you get (18 cats * 2 toys) = 36 items.

Adding up all the animals and toys we get: 12 items (from puppies) + 36 items (from cats) = 48 items in total.

Step 1: Find out the max number of apples a single box can hold. As each box holds 13% of total apples, for the lower range of total apples i.e., 245, one box can hold 245 * 13/100 = 31.85 apples.

Since we cannot have a fraction of an apple or a box, we will round this up to 32 apples per box (as we can't put 31.85 apples in a box, and not fitting an entire apple would require another box).

Step 2: Divide the total number of apples by the capacity of one box through both ends of the spectrum.

For the lower limit (245 apples):
245 apples / 32 apples per box = 7.65 boxes

For the higher limit (255 apples):
255 apples / 32 apples per box = 7.97 boxes

In both cases, we would need to round up because we cannot have a part of a box, so we would need 8 boxes to store all the apples regardless of whether there are 245 or 255 apples, because even if there are a few apples over than a box's capacity, you would still need an extra box. 

Answer: We would need 8 boxes to store all the apples on any given day between the fluctuation range.</span></div></div>

Next, we find out how many pages are in these 14 books. Since each book has 300 pages, we multiply 14 by 300 to get 4200 pages.

She reads at a speed of one page per minute, meaning she will spend 4200 minutes reading all of these pages. 

To convert this time into hours, we need to divide by the number of minutes in an hour, which is 60. Therefore:

4200 minutes Ã· 60 = 70 hours.

So, in summary:
Lisa read a total of 4200 pages and, if she maintained a constant reading speed of one page per minute, she likely spent a total of 70 hours reading.</span></div></div>

For the first part of his journey, we have:

    Time = 3 hours
So,
    Distance = 60 miles/hour Ã— 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second part of his journey, he hit some traffic and the speed got reduced. We then have:
    Speed = 30 miles/hour
    Time = 2 hours
So,
    Distance = 30 miles/hour Ã— 2 hours = 60 miles

For the third part of his journey, he increased his speed. We then have:
    Speed = 70 miles/hour
    Time = 1.5 hours
So,
    Distance = 70 miles/hour Ã— 1.5 hours = 105 miles

To get the total distance travelled, we add the distances for each part of the journey:

    Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 + Distance3
                   = 180 miles + 60 miles + 105 miles

Consequently, if you want to determine the total number of cups that can be filled, you should multiply the number of gallons by the number of cups that each gallon can fill.

You know that each gallon fills 8 cups, so you have to multiply the 8 cups per gallon by the 3 gallons. Therefore the formula to be used is:

Number of cups = Number of gallons * Number of cups per gallon

This formula gives us:

Number of cups = 3 gallons * 8 cups/gallon

The "gallons" units cancel out, leaving the final answer in terms of "cups."

And now let's go thru the calculations:

1. Convert the movie's length from hours and minutes to just minutes to make it easier to add to the start time.
2. Adjust the movie's length to account for the watch's gain of 1 minute every hour.
3. Add the adjusted movie length to the start time to get the end time on the analogue watch. Convert this to a format more traditionally used on a digital clock (24 hour format).
4. Now, consider the extra time due to the gaining watch which we will subtract from the time we had previously calculated because the actual time in real world (on a digital clock) would be less than the time shown on the gaining analogue watch.

Let's start:

1. Convert the movie's length to minutes: 2 hours = 120 minutes. Adding this to the 15 minutes gives a total movie length of 135 minutes.
2. Adjust the movie's length for the fast watch: The watch gains 1 minute every hour. Thus, over 2 hours, the watch will have gained 2 minutes. But as the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long (i.e. 2.25 hrs), the watch would have gained additional 0.25 minutes (which is 15 seconds, but as clock doesn't show seconds, we can ignore this). Adding this to the movie's length gives a total of 137 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute because a watch doesn't show seconds).
3. Add this length to the start time: 7:08 PM + 137 minutes = 9:25 PM (on the fast analogue watch).
4. Now, we need to subtract those extra 2 minutes (we rounded up the extra 0.25 minutes to 1 minute in the 2nd step) from 9:25 PM to get the actual time in the real world (on a digital clock). So, 9:25 PM - 2 minutes = 9:23 PM.

Answer: The movie will end at 9:23 PM on a non-gaining digital clock.</span></div></div>

1) Each lap around the track: The track is 3 miles long and has an extra half mile due to elevation changes. Therefore, each lap is 3.5 miles.

2) Four times around the track: Four laps would be 4 times 3.5 miles, which equals 14 miles.

3) Two-thirds of the 5th lap: Two-thirds of one lap would be 2/3 times 3.5 miles, which equals about 2.33 miles.

4) An additional 1.5 laps: This would be 1.5 times 3.5 miles, which equals 5.25 miles.

So, if you add these all together -- 14 miles (from the four laps) + 2.33 miles (from two-thirds of a lap) + 5.25 miles (from 1.5 additional laps) -- you get a total of 21.58 miles covered in one biking session.

Now, to calculate the time taken, we know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. Therefore, Time equals Distance divided by Speed.

The total distance for the biking session was 21.58 miles. Since the speed at which you traveled was 12 miles/hour, this means it took you 21.58 miles divided by 12 miles/hour, which equals about 1.798 hours or â‰ˆ 1 hour and 48 minutes for the biking. Including the half hour break, the total biking session took you about 2 hours and 18 minutes.

Finally, in order to calculate how many such biking sessions it would take to cover the distance equivalent to the diameter of the Earth, we would need to divide the diameter of the Earth (7,918 miles) by the distance covered in each biking session (21.58 miles).

So, 7918 miles divided by 21.58 miles equals about 367 sessions. 

However, if you only have two sessions per week, it would take around:

367 sessions divided by 2 = 183.5 weeks to bike the Earth's diameter. Given that we can't really have a half week, this would need to be rounded up to 184 weeks. 

Therefore, around 184 weeks of biking twice a week, covering the distances indicated and including the breaks, would be needed to bike the equivalent of the Earth's diameter.</span></div></div>

Also, if you are biking at an average speed of 12 miles/hour, how long did it take you to complete the entire biking session including the break?

3. Add the new fish to the remaining fish: 3 Pufferfish were added to the 7 remaining fish, yielding a total of 10 fish.
4. Determine the number of each species of fish left: 5 initial Clownfish minus 1 that died leaves 4 Clownfish; similarly, 5 initial Blue Tangs minus 2 that died leaves 3 Blue Tangs; finally, 3 new Pufferfish were added.

Now to find the proportion of each species:

1. Clownfish make up 4 out of 10 fish, giving us a proportion of 4/10 or 0.4.
2. Blue Tangs make up 3 out of 10 fish, giving us 3/10 or 0.3.

We are essentially looking for a combination of integers that will total to 20, where each integer is multiplied by a coefficient of either 3, 5, or 7 (which are the sizes of the bunches of bananas).

The equation will therefore look as follows:

3x + 5y + 7z = 20

We start by trying to find values for x, y, and z that add up to 20.

One way to do this is by systematic trial and error.

We start with the bunch of 7 bananas because it's the largest one. 

Since 7*2 = 14, which is less than 20, we can definitely get 2 bunches which will have 4 bananas remaining to reach 20. 

Now, 4 is not a multiple of 3 or 5, so we might think that we need to change our configuration. However, we can buy 2 bunches of 3 bananas and one bunch of 5 bananas (2*3 + 1*5) to get the remaining 11 bananas. 

So, the possible solution is:

x = 2 (bunch of 3 bananas)
y = 1  (bunch of 5 bananas)
z = 2  (bunch of 7 bananas)

To verify the solution, we can plug the values of x, y, and z into our equation:

3(2) + 5(1) + 7(2) = 6 + 5 + 14 = 20 bananas

So, to buy exactly 20 bananas without any extra and not splitting any bunches, you should purchase 2 bunches of 3 bananas, 1 bunch of 5 bananas, and 2 bunches of 7 bananas.</span></div></div>

4th hour: He walks 4.5 miles + 50% of 4.5 miles = 4.5 + (0.50 * 4.5) = 6.75 miles.

The total distance he walks is the sum of the distances each hour:

Since one can't have a fraction of a day, she will need 31 days to read all the books, considering that on some days she might not finish a complete 50 pages but instead read fewer pages to finish a book.

10 cows produce 12 liters of milk per day each, so they produce a total of 10 * 12 = 120 liters of milk a day.
Therefore, over a week, the cows produce a total of 7 * 120 = 840 liters of milk. 

Second, we calculate the amount of milk used to produce the cheese as well as the income generated from selling the cheese. 

Since 1 cheese uses half a liter of milk, 10 cheeses use a total of 10 * 0.5 = 5 liters of milk.
With the cheese selling for $5 each, the total income from the cheese sales is 10 * 5 = $50.

Third, we calculate how much money the farmer makes from the milk sold at the market. 

420 liters of milk are sold at $2 per liter, so this generates an income of 420 * 2 = $840.

The total income generated from the cheese and the milk sales is therefore 840 + 50 = $890.

Finally, we calculate the remaining liters of milk not utilized in the week. 

From the total 840 liters of milk produced, 420 liters were sold at the market and 5 liters were used to produce the cheese. This leaves 840 - 420 - 5 = 415 liters of milk unused.

So, the farmer makes $890 from his cows in a week and has 415 liters of milk not utilized.</span></div></div>

Triangular numbers follow a sequence where each number is the sum of all the natural numbers up to that number. This matches our situation in the problem where the kid is taking an increasing number of oranges each day.

Thus, we need to find the number of the first triangular number that is more than 20. This is because this is the day when the oranges will run out.

The formula to find the nth triangular number is n*(n+1)/2. We can start from n=1 and increase it by 1 till we get a number greater or equal to 20 and that's the number of days the oranges will last.

Let's do the calculation:

- On Day 1: 1*(1+1)/2 = 1
- On Day 2: 2*(2+1)/2 = 3
- On Day 3: 3*(3+1)/2 = 6
- On Day 4: 4*(4+1)/2 = 10
- On Day 5: 5*(5+1)/2 = 15
- On Day 6: 6*(6+1)/2 = 21

As we can see, on Day 6, the total number of oranges taken (21) is bigger than the total number of oranges initially in the box (20), so the oranges will last for 5 days.

Hence, the final answer is the oranges will last for 5 days.</span></div></div>

The problem states that the car travels at 60km/hr, but after every two hours (with a half-hour break in between), its speed is halved. 

Step 2: Segment the 5-hour period.
Notice that the 5-hour period can be broken down into two 2-hour segments and an additional hour. Since the car's speed is reduced after every two-hour segment, we consider these segments separately. 

Step 3: Calculate the distance for the first two hours.
In the first two-hour segment, the car travels at its original speed, 60km/hr. Therefore, in two hours, it travels 60km/hr x 2 hours = 120km. 

Step 4: Calculate the distance for the next two hours.
In the second two-hour segment, the car travels at half the original speed, 60km/hr / 2 = 30km/hr. Therefore, in two hours, it travels 30km/hr x 2 hours = 60km.

Step 5: Calculate the distance for the remaining hour. 
In the final hour, the car's speed is halved again, so it's 30km/hr / 2 = 15km/hr. Therefore, in the remaining hour, it travels 15km/hr x 1 hour = 15km.

Step 6: Add up the total distance.
The total distance travelled by the car in these 5 hours = 120km + 60km + 15km = 195km. 

This means that the car will travel 195 kilometers in 5 hours.</span></div></div>

So, effectively, she is spending $150 - $25 = $&lt;&lt;150-25=125>>125 every three days.

Next, we should determine how many full three-day cycles Emily can finance using her $250. Since Emily effectively spends $125 every three days, and she has $250 in her bank account, Emily can finance $250 / $125 = 2 full three-day cycles.

Therefore, Emily can continue spending her money for 2 cycles * 3 days/cycle = 6 days.

Since Emily cannot afford a full 3-day cycle after day 6, we need to determine if she can afford any additional days once she can't complete a three-day cycle.

At the beginning of day 7, she will have $250 - $125 * 2 = $0 left. Therefore, she will not have any money left to spend on the seventh day forward. So, Emily can continue spending her money for 6 days.</span></div></div>

Additionally, it is given that Jerry's height is two-thirds that of Tom's. If Jerry's height came out to be 1.2 feet, this value should be two-thirds of Tom's height.

In other words, for the first and second hours, the speed corresponds with the number 1 from the sequence (15 miles per hour); for the third hour, the speed corresponds with the number 2 from the sequence (25 miles per hour), and for the fourth hour, the speed corresponds with the number 3 (15 miles per hour). 

This connection with the sequence doesn't mean a multiplicative relationship with the speed numbers though, but rather which speed â€“the lower or the higherâ€“ the bicycle is going at any given hour.

To calculate the total distance for four hours:

1. In first hour, the bicycle travels at 15 miles per hour. So, in the first hour it will cover = 1 hour * 15 miles/hour = 15 miles.
2. In the second hour, the bicycle also travels at 15 miles per hour. So in the second hour it will cover = 1 hour * 15 miles/hour = 15 miles.
3. In the third hour, it switches to 25 miles per hour. So the distance covered in the third hour = 1 hour * 25 miles/hour = 25 miles.
4. In the fourth hour, it switches back to 15 miles per hour again. So the distance in the fourth hour = 1 hour * 15 miles/hour = 15 miles.

Now, to find the total distance travelled in all four hours, simply add up the distances for each hour.

So, total distance = first hour distance + second hour distance + third hour distance + fourth hour distance = 15 miles + 15 miles + 25 miles + 15 miles = 70 miles.

So, the bicycle would travel 70 miles in four hours following this pattern.</span></div></div>

1. First, we find out how many pies the baker made over the two days.
   The baker makes 4 pies every hour.
   On day 1, he baked for 8 hours, so he made 4 * 8 = 32 pies.
   On day 2, he baked for 6 hours, so he made 4 * 6 = 24 pies.
   In total, the baker made 32 + 24 = 56 pies over the two days.

2. Next, we compute how much revenue the baker generated from his sales.
   He sold half of the pies made on day 1 which is 32/2 = 16 pies.
   He sold two-thirds of the pies made on day 2 which is 24 * 2/3 = 16 pies.
   So in total, the baker sold 16 + 16 = 32 pies.
   He sells each pie for $5, so his total revenue is 32 * $5 = $160.

3. Then, we determine the baker's profit, which is revenue minus costs.
   The cost to make each pie is $2, and he made 56 pies, so his total cost is 56 * $2 = $112.
   His profit is therefore the revenue of $160 minus the cost of $112 = $48.

4. Finally, we adjust the profit total if the baker made an error
   If the baker actually made one less pie every hour, his total pies made would be 3 pies per hour instead of 4.
   So on day 1, he would have made 3 * 8 = 24 pies.
   And on day 2, he would have made 3 * 6 = 18 pies.
   Total pies would then be 24 + 18 = 42 pies.
   His cost would now be 42 * $2 = $84.
   He would still sell half of the pies from day 1, which is 24/2 = 12 pies.
   And two-thirds of the pies from day 2, which is 18 * 2/3 = 12 pies.
   In total, he would sell 12 + 12 = 24 pies.
   His revenue would then be 24 * $5 = $120.
   The adjusted profit would be revenue of $120 minus cost of $84 = $36.

So, when factoring in the baker's error, his adjusted profit would be $36.</span></div></div>

We need to convert them into similar units to be able to work with them. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, the 5 liters of water in the jug equals 5000 milliliters (5*1000).

The glass is being filled in 70% increments each time. This means that each time we fill the glass, it holds 70% of 200 milliliters, or 140 milliliters (200*0.70). 

To determine how many full glasses of water the jug can provide, we'll divide the total amount of water in the jug (in milliliters) by the amount of water used to fill each glass.

This calculation is 5000 milliliters (the total water in the jug) divided by 140 milliliters (the amount used to fill each glass), which equals about 35.71.

However, it is not possible to pour a fractional glass, and we specified that any excess water beyond a full increment can't be used. So, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

So, the jug can provide 35 full 70% increment glasses.</span></div></div>

The first half of the week is 3.5 days, but since a hen can't lay eggs for half a day, we'll consider this as 3 days. The remaining days of the week are thus 7-3=4 days.

For the first three days, the hen lays 3 eggs per day, so in total, it lays 3*3=9 eggs.

For the remaining 4 days, the rate of laying eggs increases by 10% per day. 

On the 4th day, it will lay 3+3*(10/100) = 3.3 eggs (we'll round that down to 3, because a hen can't lay 0.3 of an egg).

On the 5th day, it will lay 3+3*(20/100) = 3.6 eggs (we'll round that down to 3 for the same reason).

On the 6th day, it will lay 3+3*(30/100) = 3.9 eggs (we'll round that up to 4 because it's closer to 4 than 3).

On the 7th day, it will lay 3+3*(40/100) = 4.2 eggs (we'll round that down to 4 for the same reason as above).

Therefore, for these 4 days, it will lay 3+3+4+4 = 14 eggs in total.

As such, the total number of eggs the hen will lay by the end of the week is 9 (for the first 3 days) + 14 (for the last 4 days) = 23 eggs. So, the hen will lay 23 eggs by the end of the week.</span></div></div>

Given there are 100 marbles in total, and we know how many are blue, red, and green, we can subtract the known quantity of marbles from 100 to find out how many yellow marbles there are.

We know that 25 are blue, 27 are red, and 13 are green. When we add these numbers together, we get 65. This means that there were 100 - 65 = 35 yellow marbles in the bag to begin with.

If we remove 3 yellow marbles from the bag, there will be 100 - 3 = 97 marbles remaining in the bag.

To find the fraction of marbles that are blue, we divide the number of blue marbles (which hasn't changed) by the new total number of marbles. This gives us 25 / 97.

So, the fraction of the remaining marbles that are blue is 25/97.</span></div></div>

Here is a step-by-step run down of my calculations:

Step 1: Determine the number of bees in the hive producing honey at any given time.
The problem states that one-third of the bees are out collecting nectar, this means two-thirds of the bees are in the hive. Therefore, I multiply 250 bees by 2/3 to determine the total number of bees producing honey. 

Step 2: Calculate how much honey is produced per day in normal weather.
Because each bee produces 1 gram of honey daily, I multiply the number of bees from step 1 by 1 gram to find the total amount of honey.

Step 3: Calculate how much honey is produced per day in cooler weather.
The problem states that the production rate drops by 20% in cooler weather. So I have to subtract 20% from the normal daily production. Then I multiply that percentage (0.80 since 1-0.20 = 0.80) by the amount of honey produced on a normal day.

Let's do the math now:

Step 1: 250 bees * 2/3 = 166.67 bees. Since we can't have a fraction of a bee, we can round this up to say that there are 167 bees producing honey.

Step 2: 167 bees * 1 gram/bee per day = 167 grams of honey per day in normal weather.

Step 3: 167 grams * 0.80 = 133.6 grams of honey. Again, we can't have a fraction of a gram, so we can round this up to say that 134 grams of honey are produced on cooler days.

So, the bees produce 167 grams of honey in a day in normal weather and 134 grams of honey in a day when the weather is cooler.</span></div></div>

According to the problem, the number of boys is three times the number of girls, so we can express the number of boys as 3g.

Since the total number of students in the class is equal to the number of girls plus the number of boys, we can create the following equation:

g (girls) + 3g (boys) = 30 (total students)

Solving this equation will give us the number of girls in the class. 

Step 1: Combine like terms. We get 4g = 30. 
Step 2: Solve for 'g.' Doing so, we find g=30/4=7.5.

Since we can't have half a student, it appears there's been a mistake in the problem setup, as it yields a non-integer student count. However, if we consider the fact that this could be an average over several classes, and continue with the fractional student count, we could say there's an average of 7.5 girls per class.

To find out what part of the class is made up of girls, we divide the number of girls by the total number of students in the class:

7.5 girls Ã· 30 students = 0.25 

So 25% or 1/4 of the students are girls, according to the way the original problem was posed.</span></div></div>

As per the problem, for every 5 baseball cards that Tim gets, Paul receives only 2. This means that the ratio of Tim's cards to Paul's cards is 5:2.

This week, Tim's total card count after adding an additional 15 cards is 25 cards.

If Tim's final card count (25) is divided by the ratio that represents his share (5), it would give us the total number of combined "shares" or "transactions" of cards between Tim and Paul.

So, 25(Tim's total cards) / 5(Tim's share ratio) = 5 transactions.

If we then multiply the total number of transactions by the ratio representing Paul's share (2), we will get the total number of cards Paul should have.

So, 5 transactions * 2 (Paul's share ratio) = 10 cards.

It's mentioned that she receives a new book every 3 weeks. To identify the number of books she receives over a certain period of time, we divide the total duration (in weeks) by 3 (the frequency of receiving books). 

However, it's important to remember that Jane is continuously reading as well, and she manages to finish one book every week. 

It's also mentioned that she already has 5 books to read. So, we need to take into account these aspects.


Factor 1: Initial number of books = 5 (this is her initial reading list).
Factor 2: Reading rate = 1 book/week
Factor 3: Frequency of receiving new books = every 3 weeks

To reason through the problem, let's step forward in time week by week, adding a book every three weeks and subtracting a book every week.

From the start, Jane has five weeks of reading to do (5 books to read). After those five weeks, she will have received 5/3 books (the exact number depends on whether she receives the first book at the beginning or the end of the third week, this part of the problem is vaguely defined.) If she receives a book at the end of the third week, in the first five weeks, she will receive 1 book. So at the end of 5 weeks, she is left with 1 book to read. 

Letâ€™s take things forward mathematically from here on -
Let N be the total number of weeks it would take for Jane to finish all the books, including the books she will receive from the book club. 

After each cycle of three weeks, Jane will have read 3 books but received 1, which effectively reduces the total book count by 2 every 3 weeks (hence -2/3).

Let's assume that it takes N weeks for Jane to finish all the books and consider the equation:

5 (initial books) + N/3 (books received) - N (books read) = 0 

This simplifies to:

5 = 2N/3

Hence, N = 15/2 = 7.5 weeks

Since Jane finishes a book every week and cannot finish half a book, we would round this up to 8 weeks.

So, it takes Jane 8 weeks to finish all the books.</span></div></div>

So there are 4 apples left in each pile after John and Mary eat some of them. 

Since there are 15 different varieties of apples (i.e. 15 piles in total), to find out the total number of apples left on the table after John and Mary had their meals (apples), we multiply the amount left in each pile (4) by the total number of piles (15). 

The reason why we multiply is because the total number of remaining apples is equivalent to the sum of the apples in each pile: pile_1 + pile_2 + ... + pile_15, but since the number of apples in each pile is the same (4), we can simplify this long addition into a multiplication: 4 * number_of_piles.

Then, we convert the duration of his breaks from minutes to hours so we can add to the total time. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes break time is equal to 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours.

Lastly, we add these two time periods to get the overall length of the journey. The total time for the journey, including his breaks and driving, is 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

Each wing of a chapter contains about 20 pages. If a chapter is divided into 2 wings that means each chapter consists of 20*2=40 pages. With 22 chapters, 40 * 22 = 880 pages will be in the entire book.

However, you mentioned that in the book, each page contains 300 words. So, the total amount of words would be 880 pages * 300 words/page = 264000 words.

In the second part of your question, you mentioned that the book claims to contain 90000 words in total.

The difference between the calculated total words (264000 words) and the claimed total words (90000 words) is the number of words that exist in the unnumbered pages of the book.

Let's calculate:

Number of words in unnumbered pages = Calculated total words - Claimed total words
= 264000 - 90000
= 174000 words

Now, we need to figure out the number of unnumbered pages. Given that each page consists of 300 words, we divide the total number of words in unnumbered pages by the number of words per page.

Number of unnumbered pages = Number of words in unnumbered pages / Words per page
= 174000 / 300
= 580 pages.

So, there are 580 unnumbered pages in the book.

However, this result contradicts the information you've given that the book consists of 450 pages in total. Either there's a mistake in the information provided, or there's some context that I'm missing. Could you please check the data you've provided?</span></div></div>

1. First, we have 5 mature cows that produce 10 liters of milk per day. Therefore, the combined daily production of the mature cows is 5 cows * 10 liters = 50 liters.

2. Second, we have 3 young cows that produce 7.5 liters of milk per day. Hence, their combined daily production would be 3 cows * 7.5 liters = 22.5 liters.

3. Daily total milk production is the sum of the production from mature and young cows or 50 liters + 22.5 liters = 72.5 liters.

4. In a week, the total milk production is 7 days * 72.5 liters = 507.5 liters.

5. However, we also have a special condition stated - that one of the mature cows might not give milk due to her health conditions every 7th day. If that occurs, that day's total milk production will be less than 72.5 liters by 10 liters (because the cow not producing is a mature cow). That day's production would be 72.5 liters - 10 liters = 62.5 liters.

6. Therefore, in a week of 7 days, we would have 6 days with the total milk production as 72.5 liters and 1 day with 62.5 liters.

7. To find the weekly total with this condition, we can multiply the 6 days by the usual 72.5 liters and add the 62.5 liters of the 7th day: (6 days * 72.5 liters) + 62.5 liters = 437.5 liters + 62.5 liters = 500 liters.

8. To find the average daily amount of milk collection in a week, we need to divide the total weekly production by 7 days. 

Let's calculate that.</span></div></div>

After spending on candy, the money he had left is 50 cents - 20 cents = 30 cents. 

Next, we consider the coins he received from his friend. These were 3 coins * 25 cents = 75 cents. After receiving these coins, the total money he had is 30 cents + 75 cents = 105 cents.

Finally, consider the 2 coins he found which were 50 cents each making 2 coins * 50 cents = 100 cents.

The run rate was 3 runs per over for the first 25 overs. 

So, the number of runs in the first 25 overs = Run rate for first 25 overs * number of overs 
                                                              = 3 runs/over * 25 overs

The total number of runs scored in the match is 200. Therefore, the runs scored in the last 25 overs can be calculated as the total runs minus the runs scored in the first 25 overs.

So, Runs scored in last 25 overs = Total runs - Runs in first 25 overs
                                                = 200 runs - 75 runs

The run rate is defined as the average number of runs a team scores per over. 

So, the run rate for the last 25 overs = Runs in last 25 overs / Number of overs
                                                              = 125 runs / 25 overs

Because you can't have a fraction of a table, this rounds down to 18 tables.

Next, find out how many people can be seated at each table now, considering the 50% social distancing guideline. 

Each table originally seats 4 people, so its 50% capacity would calculate as:

4 * 0.5 = 2 people.

Now that we know how many tables can be occupied and the new seating capacity per table, multiple these two results together to find out the total seating capacity for the restaurant under these restrictions:

18 * 2 = 36 people.

First, figure out how many pencils you can fit into each type of box:
- A small box can hold 12 pencils.
- A medium box can hold 2 small boxes, so it can hold 2 * 12 = 24 pencils.
- A large box can hold 3 medium boxes, so it can hold 3 * 24 = 72 pencils. 

From the above, we know that 72 pencils can be stored in one large box. But there are only 36 pencils to be stored which means no large boxes can be used as they cannot be filled to capacity with just 36 pencils.

From here, we use the medium boxes. 

Each medium box can store 24 pencils, but we only have 12 pencils remaining after filling 1 medium box with 24 pencils (36 - 24 = 12 pencils). Therefore, one medium box is filled to capacity and is stored away.

We then have 12 pencils left over, which is exactly the capacity of a small box so we use one small box to store these remaining pencils.

To do this, divide total amount of money you have by the cost of one bag of candy after tax:

$20.00 / $5.25 â‰ˆ 3.8. 

But, you can't buy 3.8 bags of candy, so you can only afford to buy 3 bags without going over your budget of $20. 

In conclusion, you are able to buy 3 bags of candy.</span></div></div>

Now that we have the speed of the train in each of the two hours, we can calculate the distance it travels. Distance is speed multiplied by time. 

In the first hour, the train will cover a distance of 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.

In the second hour, the train will cover a distance of 66 mph * 1 hour = 66 miles. 

To get the total distance the train travels in the two hours, we add the two distances together. Hence, 60 miles + 66 miles = 126 miles.

Step 1:
Start by finding the total number of the fruit. Adding up the quantities of all the types of fruits gives:

Number of fruits = Number of apples + Number of oranges + Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 32 apples + 8 oranges + 10 bananas + 5 pears
= 55 fruits in total

Since we are interested in the proportion of the fruit that is apples, we calculate the proportion of apples in terms of quantity by dividing the number of apples by the total number of fruits:

Proportion of apples (in quantity) = 32 apples / 55 fruits
= approximately 0.582 or 58.2% of the fruit are apples

Step 2:
Next, we calculate the total weight of the fruits. First, we need to find the weights of all fruit types. We know the total weight of apples is 3.2 kg. The weight of each orange is 150 grams, each banana is 120 grams, and each pear is 200 grams. Therefore, the total weight of oranges is 8 oranges * 150 grams/orange = 1.2 kg; the total weight of bananas is 10 bananas * 120 grams/banana = 1.2 kg; the total weight of pears is 5 pears * 200 grams/pear = 1 kg. 

The total weight of the fruits is the sum of the weights of all the fruit types plus the weight of the basket, which is given as 500 grams (0.5 kg). So:

Total weight = Weight of apples + Weight of oranges + Weight of bananas + Weight of pears + Weight of basket
= 3.2 kg  + 1.2 kg + 1.2 kg + 1 kg + 0.5 kg
= 7.1 kg

Once again, since we are interested in the proportion of the fruit that is apples, we calculate the proportion of apples in terms of weight by dividing the weight of apples by the total weight:

Proportion of apples (in weight) = 3.2 kg / 7.1 kg
= approximately 0.451 or 45.1% of the total weight is apples.

To summarize:

The proportion of fruits that are apples in terms of quantity is approximately 58.2% and in terms of weight is approximately 45.1%.</span></div></div>

Step 1: Calculate the total cost:

The total cost would be the sum of the cost of the dress, the designer belt, and the vintage brooch. So, $50 (dress) + $20 (belt) + $10 (brooch) = $80. 

Step 2: Calculate the profit:

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the selling price. In this case, that would be $120 (selling price) - $80 (total cost) = $40.

Step 3: Calculate the profit percentage:

The profit percentage is calculated by dividing the profit by the total cost and then multiplying the result by 100. So, ($40 profit / $80 total cost) * 100 = 50%.

1. First, we know that Nancy is 35 years old.

2. Perry is 2 years older than Nancy. So Perry is 35 + 2 = 37 years old.

3. James is 3 years older than Perry. So James is 37 + 3 =40 years old.

Now, we can perform some other checks to make sure our calculations were correct.

4. Nancy is said to be 10 years younger than Benjamin. So, Benjamin is 35 + 10 = 45 years old.

5. According to the problem, James is two-thirds of Benjamin's age. If we multiply Benjamin's age by 2/3, we should get James' age: 45 * 2/3 = 30 years, which does not match with our previous result.

There seems to be a contradiction here. Either the information given is incorrect or our calculations went wrong. However, we strictly followed the information given in the text.

This would be 2 boxes to 10 books or in simpler terms, 1 box for every 5 books. 

It's because 2 boxes/10 books simplifies to 1 box/5 books by dividing both sides of the ratio by 2. 

Having 200 books to store, we keep the ratio of 1 box for every 5 books. 

Therefore, to find out the number of boxes needed, you simply divide the number of books, which is 200, by the number of books that fit in one box, which is 5.

This will result in the total number of boxes required for 200 books. 

We are also told that each box cannot exceed a maximum weight limit of 20 kg and the largest book dimension can't exceed the box dimension, but no additional information is given about the weight or size of the books. Hence, for the purposes of this problem, we will assume that in our initial ratio of 2 boxes for 10 books, these conditions are already met. Therefore, we only need to apply the ratio we've defined.

So the final calculation is 200 books / 5 books per box = 40 boxes.

Therefore, we can first calculate the percentage increase from the first to the second test. This can be done as follows:
Percentage increase from 70 to 80 = ((80 - 70) / 70) * 100 = 14.29% 

The percentage increase from the second to the third test also needs to be 14.29%. So, let's calculate the score he obtained in the third test by increasing the second test's score by this percentage. This can be done as follows:
Score in the third test = 80 + (80 * 14.29 / 100) = 91.43
But it's given that he scored 90 on the third test, so there seems to be some error here, let's cross-check the percentage difference between the second and third test scores:
Percentage difference between second and third test = ((90 - 80) / 80) * 100 = 12.5%

This is different from the 14.29% we calculated - seems like there was a mistake in the problem statement saying the percentage increase was the same.

Regardless of that, to find out the score Mark got in his fourth test, we need to know that the average of all four tests scores was 85. Therefore, the total of all four test scores is 85 * 4 = 340. 

To find the score Mark got on the fourth test, we then subtract the total of Mark's first, second, and third test scores from 340. 
Then 340 - (70 + 80 + 90) = 100

Finally, we'll total these two groups to find the total number of kittens and grandkittens.

1) First calculate the total number of kittens:
7 (original cats) * 4 (kittens per original cat) = 28 kittens.

2) Then calculate the total number of grandkittens:
28 (kittens) * 3 (kittens per matured kitten) = 84 grandkittens.

1. Acceleration:
The average speed of an object accelerating from 0 km/hr to 60 km/hr is half of the final speed.
So during the acceleration phase, the average speed = (0 + 60)/2 = 30 km/hr.
Given that the acceleration lasted for 28 minutes, we need to convert this time into hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 28 minutes = 28/60 = 0.47 hours (approx).
The distance covered during the acceleration phase = average speed x time = 30 km/hr x 0.47 hours = 14.1 km (approx).

2. Constant speed:
During the part of the journey where the train was moving at a constant speed, the distance covered = speed x time.
Time here is 89 minutes which is 89/60 = 1.48 hours (approx).
So the distance covered = 60 km/hr x 1.48 hours = 88.8 km (approx).

3. Deceleration:
The deceleration phase is similar to the acceleration phase. During deceleration, the train slows from 60 km/hr to 0 km/hr, so the average speed is again 30 km/hr.
Given that the deceleration lasted for 22 minutes, time in hours is 22/60 = 0.37 hours (approx).
Distance covered during deceleration = average speed x time = 30 km/hr x 0.37 hours = 11.1 km (approx).

The total distance the train traveled is the sum of the distances covered in all three phases.
Total distance = distance in acceleration phase + distance at constant speed + distance in deceleration phase
Total distance = 14.1 km + 88.8 km + 11.1 km = 114 km.

The selling price of the item would be the original price minus the discount, so:

selling price = original price - discount

selling price = $50 - $15 = $35

Now, we know that the profit is 20% of the selling price, so:

profit = selling price * profit rate

profit = $35 * 0.20 = $7

So, the original price of the item was $50, it was sold for $35, and the shopkeeper made a profit of $7.</span></div></div>

From the problem:
- Todd is twice as old as Jane -> Todd = 2 * Jane
- Jane is 5 years younger than Mary -> Jane = Mary - 5
- Mary is half the age of Alex -> Mary = 0.5 * Alex
- Alex is ten years younger than Lisa -> Alex+10 = Lisa
- Lisa is 15 years older than Todd -> Lisa = Todd + 15

Step 2: Use a combination of substitution and simple algebra to solve the problem.
Since we are asked to solve for Todd's age, we are looking at solving for the variable 'Todd'. Follow these steps:
- Substitute Lisa in Alex's equation -> Alex +10 = Todd + 15
- Solve for Todd -> Todd = Alex - 5

Substitute Alex in Mary's equation (Knowing that Mary is half Alex's age):
- Mary = 0.5 * (Todd + 5)

Substitute Mary in Jane's equation:
- Jane = Mary - 5 = 0.5 * (Todd + 5) -5

Substitute Jane in Todd's equation:
- Todd = 2 * Jane = 2 * [0.5 * (Todd + 5) - 5]

Step 3: Solve this equation for Todd.
- Todd = Todd + 10 - 20 -> Collect like terms.
- Todd = 10

So, according to the statements given, Todd is 10 years old.</span></div></div>

Initially, there are 20 oranges. The problem says half of the oranges were removed, so remaining oranges are 20 / 2 = 10.

The number of apples and bananas remain the same, 60 and 40 respectively, because no changes are mentioned for these fruits.

15 pears are added to the basket. 

So we have:

- Oranges: 10

- Apples: 60

- Bananas: 40

- Pears: 15

We want to find the new ratio of oranges to the combined total of apples, bananas, and pears. 

First add up the numbers of apples, bananas, and pears: 60 + 40 + 15 = 115.

The required ratio is therefore 10 (oranges) to 115 (apples + bananas + pears). This ratio can be written as 10:115. We can simplify dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. 

So the simplified ratio is 10 / 5 : 115 / 5 = 2 : 23. 

So, the ratio of oranges to the combined number of apples, bananas, and pears is 2:23.</span></div></div>

Let's consider the month to have 4 weeks for simplicity. Note that each week, the water consumption increases by 5% from the previous week.

The water consumption pattern for each week is as follows:

- Week 1: 10 gallons/day * 7 days = 70 gallons
- Week 2: 10 gallons/day * 1.05 (5% increase) * 7 days = 73.5 gallons
- Week 3: 10 gallons/day * 1.05 * 1.05 (another 5% increase) * 7 days = approximately 77.175 gallons
- Week 4: 10 gallons/day * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 (another 5% increase) * 7 days = approximately 81.03375 gallons

So, you would add up all the totals for each week to get total water consumption for the month:

70 gallons (week 1) + 73.5 gallons (week 2) + 77.175 gallons (week 3) + 81.03375 gallons (week 4) = approximately 301.70975 gallons

Time = 3 hours
Distance = Speed x Time = 50 miles/hour x 3 hours = 150 miles

Then we calculate the distance for the second part of the journey:

Speed = 30 miles/hour
Time = 1.5 hours
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 45 miles

Finally we calculate the distance for the third part of the journey:

Speed = 60 miles/hour
Time = 2 hours
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

Adding all these distances together gives us:

Since he is putting a different amount of cookies in half of the boxes, we will consider each half separately.

First, we calculate the number of boxes for the 15 cookies per box portion. We can determine this by dividing the total number of cookies by 2, to find out how many cookies are in this half, and dividing it by the number of cookies per box.

Similarly, we also calculate the number of boxes for the 12 cookies per box portion.

Adding these two result will give us the total number of boxes.

If Mike puts 15 cookies in each box, he would be able to put 570 / 2 = 285 cookies in those boxes. Thus, the number of 15-cookie boxes he needs would be 285 / 15 = 19 boxes.

The other half of the cookies, if they are put into boxes of 12, would also be 570 / 2 = 285 cookies. This would require 285 / 12 = 23.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fractional box, we will round up to 24 boxes since Mike will still need an extra box for the remaining cookies.

In total, the number of boxes required is 19 + 24 = 43 boxes.

Step 2 - Add the increase to the original price:
We add the $12 increase to the original price of $60 which amounts to 60 + 12 = $72. Thus, after the increase, the shirt costs $72.

Step 3 - Find the 50% sale discount:
Next, we'll apply the 50% discount to the new price of $72. The 50% discount of $72 is calculated as 72 * (50/100) = $36.

Step 4 - Subtract the discount from the increased price:
The sale price is then found by subtracting the $36 discount from the increased price of $72. This gives 72 - 36 = $36.

However, in a worst case scenario, you could lose 8 days a month (every Sunday plus the first of the month). 

Since you have to try 28 flavors and you can theoretically try one flavor per day, it'd take you 28 days if the ice cream shop was open seven days a week. But given the shop's schedule, we need to account for the closures.

To make the calculation, let's consider the worst case scenario:

- Weekdays: there are 28 to 30 or 31 days in a month, out of which seven (every Sunday) plus one (the first day of month) would not count, giving us 20 to 23 or 24 possible weekdays in a month.
  
However, in calculating for a worst-case scenario (meaning we're assuming you're the most unlucky and every possible rest day falls within your 28-day period), we'll consider the shop only opens 20 days in a month.

Now let's divide the number of flavors (28) by our worst case number of days, which is 20 days. 

28 / 20 = 1.4

Given that the answer is not a whole number, you need to round upâ€”meaning in this worst-case scenario, you would need to take two months. 

This is the maximum number of months it will take you. However, depending on how the days fall and when you start, you could finish in less time.

The typist works for two hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

We know that the typist takes a 5-minute break after every 20 minutes. This means that for every 25 minutes (20 minutes of work + 5 minutes of break), the typist is actually typing for 20 minutes. 

Divide 120 by 25 to find out how many 25-minute intervals are in 2 hours. This equals 4.8 intervals. 

Since we can't really have a fraction of an interval, let's round this down to 4 because the typist won't have enough time to complete the fifth 25-minute interval (20 minutes of typing + 5 minutes of break).

So, the total typing time is 4 intervals multiplied by 20 minutes of typing, which equals 80 minutes of typing.

Now, if the typist types 60 words per minute, and they're typing for 80 minutes, multiply those numbers together to find the total number of words typed. 

So, the calculation should be 80 (minutes) * 60 (words/minute)

Final Answer: The typist will be able to type 4,800 words in this time frame.</span></div></div>
