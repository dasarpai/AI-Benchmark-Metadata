They had a toy gun that made a loud noise when they pulled the trigger. They liked to pretend they were strong heroes who fought bad guys.\n\nOne day, they were playing in the backyard when they heard a knock on the door. It was their neighbor, Mrs. Lee, who was very old and kind. She brought them some cookies and asked them what they were playing.\n\n\&quot;We are strong heroes, Mrs. Lee,\&quot; Tim said. \&quot;We have a gun and we can stop any bad guys.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;That sounds like fun,\&quot; Mrs. Lee said. \&quot;But be careful with that gun, boys. It might scare someone who doesn't know it's a toy.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;OK, Mrs. Lee, we will,\&quot; Sam said. \&quot;Thank you for the cookies.\&quot;\n\nMrs. Lee smiled and left. Tim and Sam ate some cookies and then continued their game. They ran around the backyard, shooting their gun and making noises.\n\nBut they didn't notice that a real bad guy was hiding behind a bush.

He thought they were making fun of him.\n\nHe jumped out of the bush and pointed his gun at them.

She had a pink dress, a wand and wings. She wanted to show her friends her fairy costume. She asked her mom if she could go outside.\n\nMom said yes, but she had to be careful. She said there was a big hole in the path near the park. She said Lily had to stay away from the hole. She said it was very deep and dangerous.\n\nLily said okay and ran outside. She saw her friends playing on the swings. She waved her wand and said hello. Her friends liked her fairy costume. They asked her if she could do magic.\n\nLily said yes, she could. She said she could make anything available with her wand. She said she could make candy, toys, or flowers. Her friends asked her to make something for them.\n\nLily said okay and looked around. She saw a big tree with red apples. She pointed her wand at the tree and said, \&quot;Apples, apples, come to me!\&quot; She hoped the apples would fall and roll to her.\n\nBut the apples did not fall. Instead, the tree shook and made a loud noise. Lily and her friends were scared. They saw a big squirrel come out of the tree. The squirrel was angry. It had a big nut in its mouth. It had been saving the nut for winter.\n\nThe squirrel saw Lily and her wand. It thought Lily wanted to take its nut. It did not like that. It ran towards Lily and squeaked.

But you have to listen to me. Magic is not real. You can't make things available with your wand. You can only pretend. And you have to watch where you're going. The hole is real. It can hurt you.\&quot;\n\nLily said, \&quot;I know, Mom. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Can we go home?\&quot;\n\nMom said, \&quot;Yes, we can. But first, let's say goodbye to your friends.

We hope they like them.\&quot;\n\nMr. Lee thanked them and said, \&quot;That's very kind of you, children. You are very generous. The other children will love your toys and books.

Summary: Sara and Ben were playing in the park, but Sara wanted to go home because it was cold and dark. Ben convinced her to stay and play, but eventually agreed to go home and have hot cocoa.
Story: 



Sara and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to climb the big oak tree and pretend they were birds. They made nests with leaves and twigs and sang songs.

But today, the sky was gloomy and the wind was cold. Sara felt sad and cold. She wanted to go home and have some hot cocoa.

"Ben, I want to quit," she said. "It's too cold and dark. Let's go home."

Ben looked at Sara and frowned. He liked the oak tree and the park. He wanted to stay and play.

"No, Sara, don't quit," he said. "It's fun here. Look, there's a squirrel. Let's chase it."

Sara shook her head. She didn't want to chase the squirrel. She wanted to go home and have some hot cocoa.

"Please, Ben, let's go home," she said. "We can play here another day. I'm cold and hungry."

Ben saw that Sara was shivering and looked unhappy. He loved his sister and didn't want her to be sad. He nodded and smiled.

"Okay, Sara, let's go home," he said. "We can have some hot cocoa and cookies. And we can play with our toys."

Sara hugged Ben and thanked him. They climbed down the oak tree and ran to their mom, who was waiting for them. They told her about their adventure and asked for some hot cocoa and cookies. Mom smiled and agreed. She was proud of her children for being brave and kind. They went home and had a cozy and happy time.</span></div></div>

Story: 



Lily liked to ride her bike. She rode it every day after work. Work was a place where she helped her mom and dad with chores. She liked work, but she liked riding her bike more.

One day, she saw a new bike in the store. It was shiny and red and had a bell. Lily wanted the new bike very much. She asked her mom and dad if they could buy it for her. They said no. They said the new bike was too expensive and that she already had a good bike.

Lily was upset. She did not listen to her mom and dad. She thought they were mean and unfair. She decided to take the new bike without paying. She waited until the store was busy and then she sneaked out with the bike.

She rode the new bike very fast. She felt happy and proud. She rang the bell and smiled. She did not see the car coming. The car hit her and the bike. Lily and the bike flew in the air and then crashed on the ground.

Lily was hurt very badly. She cried and screamed. The store owner and her mom and dad came running. They saw what she had done. They were angry and sad. They called an ambulance and the police. Lily had to go to the hospital and then to jail. She lost her old bike and her new bike. She also lost her mom and dad's trust and love.

The moral of the story is: do not steal. Stealing is wrong and dangerous. It can hurt you and others. Be happy with what you have and listen to your mom and dad. They know what is best for you.</span></div></div>

Summary: Two brothers, Tim and Sam, played pretend heroes with a toy gun until a real bad guy threatened them. Their neighbor, Mrs. Lee, saved them with a broom and called the police. They gave Mrs. Lee their toy gun and promised to never play with guns again.
Words: mention, gun, strong
Story: 



Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play pretend. They had a toy gun that made a loud noise when they pulled the trigger. They liked to pretend they were strong heroes who fought bad guys.

One day, they were playing in the backyard when they heard a knock on the door. It was their neighbor, Mrs. Lee, who was very old and kind. She brought them some cookies and asked them what they were playing.

"We are strong heroes, Mrs. Lee," Tim said. "We have a gun and we can stop any bad guys."

"That sounds like fun," Mrs. Lee said. "But be careful with that gun, boys. It might scare someone who doesn't know it's a toy."

"OK, Mrs. Lee, we will," Sam said. "Thank you for the cookies."

Mrs. Lee smiled and left. Tim and Sam ate some cookies and then continued their game. They ran around the backyard, shooting their gun and making noises.

But they didn't notice that a real bad guy was hiding behind a bush. He had a real gun and he wanted to rob their house. He saw the boys playing with their toy gun and he got angry. He thought they were making fun of him.

Mom said yes, but she had to be careful. She said there was a big hole in the path near the park. She said Lily had to stay away from the hole. She said it was very deep and dangerous.

Lily said yes, she could. She said she could make anything available with her wand. She said she could make candy, toys, or flowers. Her friends asked her to make something for them.

Lily said okay and looked around. She saw a big tree with red apples. She pointed her wand at the tree and said, "Apples, apples, come to me!" She hoped the apples would fall and roll to her.

But the apples did not fall. Instead, the tree shook and made a loud noise. Lily and her friends were scared. They saw a big squirrel come out of the tree. The squirrel was angry. It had a big nut in its mouth. It had been saving the nut for winter.

Mom said, "It's okay, Lily. I'm glad you're safe. But you have to listen to me. Magic is not real. You can't make things available with your wand. You can only pretend. And you have to watch where you're going. The hole is real. It can hurt you."

Lily said, "I know, Mom. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Can we go home?"

Mom said, "Yes, we can. But first, let's say goodbye to your friends. And let's say sorry to the squirrel. Maybe we can give it an apple. Maybe it will forgive you."

Lily said, "Okay, Mom. I will say sorry. I will be nice. I will be careful. I love you, Mom."

Mom said, "I love you too, Lily. You're my little fairy."

They ran to the pitch and started to kick the ball. They had fun, but they did not share. Tom wanted to score all the goals, and Lily wanted to keep the ball. They did not pass or help each other. They got angry and shouted.

Then, they saw a boy and a girl who were playing on the pitch too. They were older and bigger. They had a different ball that was flexible and could spring. They could bend it and bounce it and do tricks. They looked happy and friendly. They passed and helped each other. They smiled and laughed.

Tom and Lily stopped and watched. They felt silly and sad. They realized that they were not having fun. They wanted to play like the other kids. They decided to share and be nice. They said sorry to each other and hugged.

They went to the other kids and asked if they could join. The other kids said yes and gave them their flexible ball. They taught them how to spring it and bend it and do tricks. They played together and had fun. They learned that sharing and being nice is better than fighting and being selfish. They made new friends and enjoyed the pitch.</span></div></div>

"Look, an owl!" Lila said. "I want to see it better. Come, Ben, let's go closer."

"No, Lila, we can't. Mama said we have to stay away from the big tree. It is not safe. There might be bees or snakes or thorns." Ben said.

They learned their lesson. They never went to the big tree again. They played in the yard. They looked for bugs and rocks and flowers. They were happy.</span></div></div>

"Look, mom, that monkey is so funny!" Lily said, pointing at a brown monkey that was making faces at them.

"Yes, he is, but be careful, don't get too close to the glass. Monkeys can be dangerous sometimes." Mom said.

Tom wanted to see the monkey better. He climbed on a bench and leaned on the glass. He smiled at the monkey and tried to copy his face. The monkey smiled back and reached out his hand. Tom reached out his hand too, but he did not see the wet floor. He slipped and fell off the bench. He hit his head on the ground and started to cry.

"Tom, are you okay?" Mom asked, running to him. She picked him up and hugged him. She checked his head and saw a small bump. "You are very lucky, it's not a big injury. But you should listen to me and be careful. Monkeys are not toys, they are wild animals. They can bite or scratch you if you get too close."

"I'm sorry, mom, I just wanted to be friends with the monkey." Tom said, rubbing his head.

"I know, honey, but you have to respect the animals and their space. They have feelings too, and they don't like to be bothered. You can watch them and learn from them, but don't touch them or tease them. That's how you can be a good friend to the animals." Mom said.

Tom nodded and said he understood. He said sorry to the monkey and waved goodbye. The monkey waved back and made a funny face. Tom and Lily laughed and followed their mom to see the other animals. They had a fun day at the zoo, but they also learned a lesson: to be careful and respectful of the animals.</span></div></div>

Summary: Lily and Ben find a hurt bird and bring it to their mommy to help.
Story: 

Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their cart. They put their toys and books in the cart and pushed it around the yard. Sometimes they pretended it was a car, or a train, or a spaceship.

One day, they found a small bird in the grass. It had a broken wing and looked very sad. Lily and Ben felt sorry for the bird and wanted to help it. They gently picked it up and put it in their cart.

"Let's take it to Mommy," Lily said. "Maybe she can make it better."

They pushed the cart carefully to the house, where their mommy was waiting for them. She saw the bird and smiled.

"You are very clever and kind, Lily and Ben," she said. "You found a hurt bird and brought it to me. I will comfort it and wrap its wing. Then we can give it some water and seeds."

Lily and Ben were happy that their mommy could help the bird. They watched as she comforted it and made it a cozy nest in a box. They hoped the bird would heal soon and fly again. They gave it a name: Fluffy. They decided to share their cart with Fluffy until it was better. They thought Fluffy was a very brave and beautiful bird.</span></div></div>

One day, they saw a new magnet in the box. It was very big and shiny. It had a fancy picture of a star on it. Ben and Lily wanted to play with it. They took it out of the box and held it in their hands.

But the new magnet was not a toy. It was a very strong magnet that their dad used for his work. It was not safe for children. The new magnet pulled all the other magnets out of the box and made them fly in the air. The magnets hit Ben and Lily and hurt them. They cried and dropped the new magnet.

The new magnet fell on the floor and broke. It also broke the TV and the lamp and the phone. It made a big mess and a loud noise. Their dad heard the noise and came to see what happened. He was very angry and sad. He scolded Ben and Lily and took away their magnets. He said they could not play with them anymore. He said they had to go to bed early and say sorry.

Story: 

Sara and Ben were playing in the living room when they heard a knock on the door. They ran to see who it was. It was the mailman with a big package for them. He smiled and said, "This is from your grandma. She sent you a surprise. Do you want to open it?"

Sara and Ben nodded excitedly and thanked the mailman. They took the package to the couch and tore off the paper. Inside, they found a box of cookies, a book, and a toy car. They were very happy and hugged the package.

"Let's try the cookies first," Sara said. She opened the box and took out a cookie. She bit into it and made a face. "Yuck! This cookie is sour!"

Ben looked at the box and saw a label. It said, "Lemon cookies. Grandma's favorite." He laughed and said, "Grandma likes sour cookies, but we don't. Maybe we can trade them with someone who does."

Sara agreed and said, "Let's read the book and play with the toy car instead. Maybe they are more fun." They put the cookies aside and opened the book. It was a story about a brave knight and a dragon. They liked the pictures and the words. They took turns reading and listening.

Then they played with the toy car. It was red and shiny and made noises. They pretended it was a race car and zoomed it around the room. They had a lot of fun and forgot about the sour cookies.

They did not notice that their dog, Spot, had smelled the cookies and sneaked up to the package. He sniffed the box and licked a cookie. He liked the sour taste and ate the whole box. He wagged his tail and burped.

Sara and Ben heard the noise and looked at the package. They saw Spot with crumbs on his mouth. They were surprised and said, "Spot, you ate our cookies!"

Spot barked and licked their faces. He was happy and full. Sara and Ben laughed and said, "It's okay, Spot. We love you anyway. And we love grandma, too. Even if she likes sour cookies." They hugged Spot and the package and smiled.</span></div></div>

"I want to cut the hair," Tommy said. He did not understand why Lily was upset.

"No, Tommy, no!" Lily shouted. She grabbed the doll and hugged it. "You can't cut the hair. It will not grow back. The doll will be sad and ugly. You are bad, Tommy. Bad!"

Tommy was confused and sad. He did not want to be bad. He did not want to make Lily and the doll sad. He wanted to make them happy. He put down the scissors and looked at Lily.

"Can you explain to me why I can't cut the hair?" he asked. He wanted to learn and understand.

Lily calmed down a bit. She saw that Tommy was sorry and curious. She decided to explain to him.

"Look, Tommy, the hair is not like paper. Paper is not alive. You can cut it and make shapes. But hair is alive. It grows from the head. It is part of the doll. If you cut it, it will not grow back. It will stay short forever. The doll will look different and feel bad. Do you understand?"

Tommy nodded. He understood. He felt sorry for the doll. He said sorry to Lily and the doll. He hugged them both.

"I'm sorry, Lily. I'm sorry, doll. I won't cut the hair again. I love you both."

Lily smiled. She forgave Tommy. She loved him too. She said thank you to Tommy. She hugged him back.

"It's okay, Tommy. I know you didn't mean to hurt the doll. Thank you for saying sorry. I love you too."

Story: 

Tom and Lily are playing with their toy cars and trucks in the living room. They have a big red ambulance that can open and close its doors and make a siren sound. They like to pretend that they are helping people who are hurt.

"Look, Lily, there is a man who fell off his bike and hurt his leg. We need to load him into the ambulance and take him to the hospital," Tom says, picking up a small doll and putting it on a stretcher.

"Okay, Tom, I will drive the ambulance. You can be the doctor and check his leg," Lily says, getting behind the wheel of the ambulance and pressing the button to make the siren sound.

They drive the ambulance around the living room, making noises and dodging the other toys. They reach the couch, which they pretend is the hospital. Tom opens the back door of the ambulance and takes out the stretcher with the doll.

"Hello, doctor, we have a patient who needs your help. He has a broken leg and needs a bandage and a kiss," Tom says, carrying the stretcher to the couch.

"Hello, nurse, thank you for bringing him. I will take good care of him. Don't worry, he will be fine soon," the doctor says, taking the doll and wrapping a piece of cloth around his leg. He then gives him a kiss on the cheek and smiles.

"Thank you, doctor, you are very kind. Can we take him back to his home now?" Tom asks, putting the doll back on the stretcher.

"Of course, nurse, he is ready to go. But first, let's make sure the ambulance is empty and clean. We don't want to leave anything behind," the doctor says, helping Tom to load the stretcher into the ambulance and closing the door.

They drive the ambulance back to where they found the doll and put him next to his bike. They wave goodbye and say, "We hope you feel better soon. Be careful next time."

They then look for another person who needs their help. They have so much fun playing with their empty ambulance.</span></div></div>

But Mom did not listen. She grabbed their toys and put them in a box. She told them to go to their rooms and not come out until she said so. She was very mad.

Tom and Mia cried. They had to surrender their toys and go to their rooms. They felt sad and lonely. They wished they had played nicely and shared their toys. They learned a hard lesson. They had a bad ending.</span></div></div>

Story: 

Tom was a curious boy who liked to touch and see everything. One day, he saw a big knob on the wall of his room. He wondered what it was for. He climbed on his bed and reached for the knob.

"Tom, what are you doing?" his mom asked, coming into the room.

"I want to see what this knob does," Tom said.

"That knob is not a toy, Tom. It is for the heater. It makes the room warm or cold. If you turn it too much, you might get too hot or too cold," his mom explained.

Tom looked at the knob and his mom. He wanted to try it, but he also did not want to be too hot or too cold. He decided to listen to his mom.

"Okay, mom. I will not touch the knob. Can you show me how it works?" he asked.

"Sure, Tom. I will show you. But first, you have to get down from the bed. It is not safe to stand on the bed," his mom said.

Tom nodded and got down from the bed. He held his mom's hand and watched her turn the knob a little bit. He felt the air change in the room.

"See, Tom? If I turn the knob this way, the room gets warmer. If I turn it the other way, the room gets cooler. But we have to be careful not to turn it too much, or it will be uncomfortable," his mom said.

Tom understood. He thanked his mom for explaining the knob to him. He was still curious, but he also knew how to be careful. He hugged his mom and went to play with his toys. He was happy to learn something new.
Summary: Tom is a curious boy who wants to touch a knob on the wall, but his mom explains that it's for the heater and teaches him how it works.</span></div></div>

Story: 

Lily and Ben were twins who loved to eat sausages. Every morning, their mom would cook them some sausages for breakfast. They liked them so much that they would not share them with anyone, not even their dog Spot.

One day, their mom had to go to the store and left them alone for a while. She told them not to touch the stove or the sausages. But Lily and Ben did not listen. They wanted to eat more sausages. They turned on the stove and put some sausages on a pan. They did not know how to cook them well. They just waited for them to get hot and brown.

Soon, the sausages started to burn and smoke. The smoke filled the kitchen and made Lily and Ben cough. They were fearful of the fire and the noise. They tried to turn off the stove, but they burned their fingers. They ran out of the kitchen and called for their mom. But she was not there. They did not know what to do.

Spot heard their cries and came to help. He saw the smoke and the fire. He barked loudly and ran to the door. He scratched the door until he opened it. He ran outside and found their mom. He barked and pulled her by the sleeve. He led her to the house. She saw the smoke and the fire. She was scared and angry. She grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the fire. She checked on Lily and Ben. They were crying and hurt. She hugged them and took them to the doctor.

Lily and Ben learned a hard lesson. They suffered because they were greedy and disobedient. They apologized to their mom and Spot. They promised to never touch the stove or the sausages again. They also learned to share their food with others, especially with Spot. He was a good dog and a good friend. He saved them from a big trouble. They gave him some sausages as a treat. He wagged his tail and licked their faces. They were happy and grateful.</span></div></div>

Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big orange ball. They liked to bounce it, roll it, and throw it in the air.

One day, their mom said it was time for lunch. She made them some sandwiches and cut some vegetables for them. She told them to seat at the table and eat their food. Lily and Ben did not like vegetables. They made faces and said, "Yuck!"

Mom said, "You have to eat your vegetables. They are good for you. If you eat them, you can play with your ball later." Lily and Ben did not want to eat their vegetables, but they wanted to play with their ball. So they took a bite of their vegetables and swallowed them quickly.

Mom smiled and said, "Good job! Now you can go and play with your ball. But be careful, don't go too far or too fast." Lily and Ben said, "Okay, mom!" and ran outside with their ball.

They bounced it, rolled it, and threw it in the air. They had fun, but they did not listen to mom. They went too far and too fast. They did not see the big truck that was coming down the road. The truck did not see them either. The truck hit their ball and made it pop. The ball flew in the air and landed on a power line. The power line sparked and caught fire. The fire spread to the trees and the houses. Lily and Ben screamed and ran back to mom. Mom was scared and angry. She said, "What have you done? You did not listen to me. You were not careful. You caused a big fire. Now we have to leave our home. You are in big trouble." Lily and Ben cried and said, "We are sorry, mom. We did not mean to. We just wanted to play with our ball." Mom said, "Your ball is gone. And so is our home. And maybe our neighbors too. You should have eaten your vegetables. Maybe then you would have been smarter and safer." Lily and Ben felt very bad. They wished they had eaten their vegetables. They wished they had listened to mom. They wished they still had their ball. They wished they still had their home. But it was too late.

"No, you can't. It's not our boat. It belongs to someone else. You have to stay here with me," their mom said.

But Lila and Tom did not listen. They waited until their mom was busy talking to a friend and ran to the boat. They climbed on board and looked around. They saw a lot of yummy things on a table. There were cookies, cakes, fruits, and juice.

"Wow, look at all the yummy things!" Tom said.

"Let's eat some!" Lila said.

They grabbed some cookies and cakes and started to eat. They did not see the man who came out of a cabin. He was the owner of the boat. He was angry when he saw the twins eating his food.

"Hey, what are you doing here? This is my boat and my food! Get off!" he shouted.

He grabbed Lila and Tom by their arms and dragged them to the edge of the boat. He threw them into the water. They splashed and screamed. They did not know how to swim. They were scared and cold.

Their mom heard their screams and ran to the port. She saw them in the water and jumped in to save them. She pulled them out and hugged them. She was glad they were alive, but she was also very mad.

"How could you do this? You disobeyed me and went on a stranger's boat. You could have drowned or been hurt. You were very naughty and selfish. You have to say sorry to the man and to me," she said.

Lila and Tom felt ashamed and sorry. They said sorry to the man and to their mom. They learned their lesson. They never went on a stranger's boat again.

Then, he said he needed a helper for his next trick. He looked around and pointed at Tom. He said, "You, little boy, come here. I have a ticket for you." Tom was surprised and excited. He got up and walked to the ring. The clown gave him a ticket and said, "This is a magic ticket. It will make you do something amazing. Hold it in your hand and say the magic word."

Story: 

Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play in the kitchen. One day, they decided to introduce themselves to the things in the cupboard. They opened the door and saw many plates, cups, bowls and spoons.

"Hello, I am Lily and this is Tom. We are friends who like to play in the kitchen. What are your names?" Lily asked the things in the cupboard.

The things in the cupboard did not answer. They were not alive. They were just things. But Lily and Tom did not know that. They thought the things in the cupboard were shy.

"Maybe they are scared of us. Let's be nice to them. Maybe they will talk to us then." Tom said.

He took a cup and a spoon and put them on the table. He pretended to have tea with them. He said, "This is a nice cup and a nice spoon. They are my friends. Do you want some tea?"

Lily thought that was a good idea. She took a plate and a bowl and put them on the floor. She pretended to have soup with them. She said, "This is a nice plate and a nice bowl. They are my friends. Do you want some soup?"

They played like that for a while. They did not notice that their mom was watching them. She smiled and shook her head. She thought they were very cute but also very foolish. She said, "Lily and Tom, you are very silly. The things in the cupboard are not alive. They are not your friends. They are just things. You cannot talk to them. They cannot talk to you."

Lily and Tom looked at their mom. They felt confused. They said, "But mom, we wanted to introduce ourselves to them. We wanted to be nice to them. We wanted to have fun with them."

Their mom hugged them and said, "I know, my loves. You have very big imaginations. That is good. But you also have to learn the difference between real and pretend. The things in the cupboard are pretend. They are for eating and drinking. They are not for talking and playing. Do you understand?"

Lily and Tom nodded. They said, "Yes, mom. We understand. We are sorry. We will not be foolish again."

Their mom kissed them and said, "It's okay. I love you. Now, let's put the things back in the cupboard and have some real tea and soup. How does that sound?"

Lily and Tom smiled and said, "That sounds good, mom. Thank you."

They helped their mom to put the things back in the cupboard. They said goodbye to them. They said, "Bye, cup and spoon. Bye, plate and bowl. You are not our friends. You are just things. But you are still nice. Thank you for letting us play with you."

Then they had some real tea and soup with their mom. They enjoyed it very much. They learned a new lesson. They were not foolish anymore. They were happy.</span></div></div>

Summary: Lily and Ben find an old cabin in the woods and discover a pot of mud with worms in it. They realize it's a trap and run away from the angry bear who lives there. They learn a lesson about being respectful and not eating other people's food.
Story: 

Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in the woods. One day, they found a little cabin near a lake. It looked old and empty, but they wanted to see inside.

"Let's go, Lily," Ben said. "Maybe we can find something fun."

"OK, Ben," Lily said. "But be careful. We don't know who lives here."

They opened the door and walked in. The cabin was dark and dusty. There was a bed, a table, a chair, and a fireplace. On the table, there was a big pot and a spoon.

"Look, Lily," Ben said. "Someone was cooking here. Maybe they left some food for us."

He picked up the spoon and dipped it in the pot. He smelled it and made a face.

"Yuck, Lily," he said. "This is not food. This is mud. And it has worms in it."

Lily came closer and looked at the pot. She saw the worms and screamed.

"Ben, this is not a cabin," she said. "This is a trap. Someone wants to catch us and cook us. We have to run."

They dropped the spoon and ran out of the door. They heard a loud roar behind them. It was a big bear, who lived in the cabin. He was angry that someone touched his mud and worms.

"Hey, you little thieves," he shouted. "Come back here. I'm hungry and you look tasty."

Lily and Ben ran as fast as they could. They reached the woods and hid behind a tree. They were scared and sorry.

"Ben, we were wrong," Lily said. "We should not go into other people's cabins. We should ask first."

"Yes, Lily," Ben said. "We should. And we should not eat other people's food. We should cook our own."

They hugged each other and waited for the bear to go away. Then they went back to their home, where their mom was waiting for them. She was happy to see them and cooked them some soup and bread. They ate and told her what happened. She was glad they were safe and taught them a lesson.

"Remember, Lily and Ben," she said. "Don't be curious and greedy. Be polite and respectful. And don't play with bears. They are not friendly."</span></div></div>

"Let's put it in the oven," Tom said. He was impatient. He wanted to eat the cake soon.

"No, we can't," Lily said. "Mom will see it and get mad. She told us not to touch the oven. It's hot and dangerous."

"Then where can we cook it?" Tom asked. He looked around the kitchen. He saw the door to the garage. He had an idea. "I know! Let's cook it in the garage. There's a heater there. It's warm and safe."

Lily was not sure. She thought the garage was dark and scary. But Tom grabbed the bowl and ran to the door. He opened it and went inside. Lily followed him. She did not want to be alone.

They put the bowl on the heater and turned it on. They waited and waited. They did not see any smoke or smell any cake. They got bored and hungry.

"Maybe it's done," Tom said. He reached for the bowl. He did not know the heater was very hot. He burned his hand. He screamed and dropped the bowl. The cake mix spilled all over the heater and the floor.

Mom heard the screams and the fire alarm. She ran to the garage. She saw the fire and the kids. She was very angry and scared. She grabbed the kids and ran outside. She called the firemen. They came and put out the fire.

They cried and said they were sorry. But it was too late. They had made a big mess. They had learned a hard lesson.</span></div></div>

Summary: Lily and Ben are asked to donate some of their old toys and books to a charity, but they initially refuse. After being reminded of the importance of sharing and caring, they decide to give away some of their unused toys and books and feel proud and happy for doing a good thing.
Words: pinch, van, generous
Story: 

Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big van parked outside their house. The van had many toys and books inside. A man came out of the van and said, "Hello, children. I am Mr. Lee. I work for a charity that helps other children who have no toys or books. Do you want to donate some of your old toys or books to them?"

Lily and Ben thought about it. They had many toys and books, but they also loved them very much. Lily said, "I want to keep my doll and my puzzle. They are my favorites." Ben said, "I want to keep my car and my ball. They are my favorites." They looked at each other and said, "No, thank you, Mr. Lee. We don't want to give away our toys or books."

Mr. Lee smiled and said, "That's okay, children. It's your choice. But remember, sharing is caring. There are many children who have nothing to play with or read. They would be very happy if you gave them some of your toys or books. Think about how you would feel if you had no toys or books. Wouldn't you like someone to be generous and share with you?"

Lily and Ben felt a little guilty. They knew Mr. Lee was right. They had more than enough toys and books, and they could make other children happy by sharing. But they still wanted to keep their favorites. They decided to give away some of their other toys and books that they didn't play with or read much. They picked out some toys and books and put them in a bag. They gave the bag to Mr. Lee and said, "Here, Mr. Lee. These are for the other children. We hope they like them."

Mr. Lee thanked them and said, "That's very kind of you, children. You are very generous. The other children will love your toys and books. You have made them very happy. And you know what? You will also be happy, because you have done a good thing. Sharing is caring, and caring is happiness."

Lily and Ben felt proud and happy. They hugged each other and said, "We are happy, too. We have shared and cared. We have done a good thing." They waved goodbye to Mr. Lee and the van. They went back to their house and played with their favorite toys and books. They didn't pinch each other or fight over them. They shared and cared. They were happy.</span></div></div>

Ben was scared. He did not know what to do. He saw a man running to them. The man was the dog's owner. He was not polite. He was angry.

"Hey, what are you doing?" the man said. "Why did you touch my dog? He is not for hugging. He is a guard dog. He does not like strangers. You are stupid and naughty. Go away!"

Story: 

Tim and his dog Spot went for a walk in the park. Tim held Spot's leash so he would not run away. Spot liked to sniff the flowers and chase the birds. Tim liked to watch the cars and trucks on the road.

"Look, Spot, a big truck!" Tim said, pointing to a yellow truck with a loud horn. "It can carry many things. Do you want to see it?"

Spot barked and wagged his tail. He wanted to see the truck too. Tim crossed the street with Spot, looking both ways. They got close to the truck and saw the driver inside.

"Hello, mister!" Tim said to the driver. "What is your truck for?"

The driver smiled and rolled down his window. "Hello, little boy and dog. My truck is for moving dirt. I dig up dirt from one place and take it to another. Do you want to see how I do it?"

Tim nodded eagerly. He loved to see how things worked. The driver showed him a big shovel at the back of the truck. He pushed a button and the shovel moved up and down. He pushed another button and the shovel scooped up some dirt. He pushed a third button and the shovel dumped the dirt into the truck.

"Wow, that's cool!" Tim said, clapping his hands. "Can you do it again?"

The driver laughed and said, "Sure, why not?" He pushed the buttons again and repeated the process. Tim and Spot watched with wonder.

But then, something bad happened. The driver pushed the wrong button and the truck started to reverse. He did not see Tim and Spot behind him. He did not hear Tim's scream or Spot's bark. He did not feel the leash get caught in the shovel.

Tim and Spot were in trouble. The leash pulled them closer to the truck. The shovel lifted them off the ground. The truck moved back and back.

"Help! Help!" Tim cried. "Stop the truck! Stop the truck!"

A man who was walking by heard Tim's cry. He ran to the truck and banged on the door. He shouted at the driver to stop. The driver heard the noise and stopped the truck. He looked back and saw Tim and Spot hanging from the shovel. He gasped and said, "Oh no! What have I done?"

He got out of the truck and ran to the shovel. He freed the leash and lowered Tim and Spot to the ground. He checked if they were hurt. They were not hurt, but they were very scared.

"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!" the driver said, hugging Tim and Spot. "I did not see you or hear you. I pushed the wrong button. I was so stupid. Are you okay?"

Tim and Spot nodded. They were okay, but they were very shaken. They did not want to see the truck anymore. They wanted to go home.

"Thank you, mister, for saving us," Tim said to the man who helped them. "You are very brave and kind."

The man smiled and said, "You're welcome, little boy and dog. I'm glad you're okay. But you should be more careful. Don't go near big trucks. They can be dangerous."

Tim and Spot agreed. They learned their lesson. They said goodbye to the man and the driver. They crossed the street again, looking both ways. They went back to the park and finished their walk. They never went near big trucks again.</span></div></div>

Story: 

Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play with their toys, but sometimes they fight. One day, Sam sees a new truck that Ben got for his birthday. He wants to play with it, but Ben says no.

"Give me the truck!" Sam demands. He tries to grab it from Ben's hands, but Ben holds it tight. "It's mine! Go away!" Ben shouts. He pushes Sam away, and Sam falls on the floor.

Sam starts to cry. He runs to his mom and tells her what happened. Mom is not happy. She goes to Ben and scolds him. "You need to share with your brother. He is sad because you were rough and mean. How would you feel if he did that to you?" she asks.

Story: 

Sara liked to play with her dad's microscope. She wanted to see the tiny things that he saw when he worked. One day, when dad was not home, she took the microscope from his desk and put it on the floor. She found a leaf and a feather and put them under the microscope.

She looked through the eye-piece and saw the leaf had many lines and dots. She saw the feather had many hairs and colors. She was happy and said, "Wow, this is so cool!"

But then she heard a noise. It was dad coming home. She was scared and tried to hide the microscope under a pillow. She hoped dad would not be angry.

Dad came into the room and saw Sara sitting on the floor. He smiled and said, "Hello, Sara. What are you doing?"

Sara looked at dad and said, "Nothing, dad. Just playing."

Dad saw the pillow and said, "What is under the pillow, Sara?"

Sara felt guilty and said, "Sorry, dad. I took your microscope. I wanted to see the tiny things."

Dad was not angry. He was proud and said, "That's okay, Sara. I'm glad you are curious. But you have to be careful with the microscope. It is very delicate and expensive. Next time, ask me first, okay?"

Sara nodded and said, "Okay, dad. I'm sorry. Can you show me more tiny things?"

Dad hugged Sara and said, "Of course, Sara. Come, let's raise the microscope and put it on the table. I'll show you some more tiny things. And then we can have some warm cookies and milk. How does that sound?"

Sara smiled and said, "That sounds great, dad. I love you."

Dad said, "I love you too, Sara. You are my little scientist."
Summary: Sara takes her dad's microscope without permission to look at a leaf and a feather, but hides it when her dad comes home. Her dad is not angry and instead shows her more things under the microscope, and they have cookies and milk together.</span></div></div>

Summary: Joey the kangaroo and his mother unite with other kangaroos to fight off men who want to capture and sell them, and they succeed in scaring the men away.
Features: Dialogue
Story: 

One day, a little kangaroo named Joey was playing with his friends in the grass. He liked to hop and bounce and chase butterflies. He was very happy.

But then, he heard a loud noise. It was a big truck with men and nets. They wanted to catch the kangaroos and take them away. Joey was very frightened. He ran to his mother and hid in her pouch.

"Mommy, what are they doing?" he asked.

"They are bad men, Joey. They want to hurt us and sell us. We have to run away and hide," his mother said.

"But where can we go, Mommy? They are everywhere," Joey said.

His mother looked around and saw other kangaroos running and hiding too. She had an idea.

"Joey, we have to unite. We have to stick together and help each other. If we are many, we are strong. If we are alone, we are weak. Do you understand?" she said.

"Yes, Mommy. I understand. Let's unite with the other kangaroos," Joey said.

So, his mother and Joey joined the other kangaroos and formed a big group. They hopped and bounced and kicked and scratched the men and the truck. They made a lot of noise and scared the men away. They saved themselves and their friends.

Joey was very proud of his mother and his group. He was not frightened anymore. He was happy.

He hugged his mother and said, "Mommy, you are the best. We did it. We united and we won."

His mother smiled and said, "Yes, Joey. We did. We united and we won. And we are safe and free."</span></div></div>

"Can I go to the park, Mom?" she asked.

"Hello, Mister," Lily said. "What are you doing?"

"Hello, little girl," the man said. "I'm changing the bulb. It's broken and it doesn't light up at night."

"Can I see the bulb?" Lily asked.

"Sure, here you go," the man said. He handed her the bulb. It was round and glassy and had a metal part at the end.

Lily looked at the bulb and felt its smooth surface. She wondered how it could make light. She wanted to keep it, but she knew it was not hers.

"Thank you, Mister," she said. "Here's your bulb back."
