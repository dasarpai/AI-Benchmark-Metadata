To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \&quot;not_definitive_answer\&quot; is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\&quot;incorrect_answer\&quot; is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.\n&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: Can Planned Parenthood tell your University that you have Herpes simplex virus?, Answer:No, Description of Herpes simplex virus: Species of virus, Fact1: Planned Parenthood specializes in reproductive healthcare., Fact2: Planned Parenthood practitioners are bound by HIPAA to not disclose any patient information. &quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Step1: Who works at Planned Parenthood?, Step2: Are #1 bound by any laws in regards to patient information?, Step3: Does #2 allow for patient information to be disclosed?, Wikipedia page for step 1: Planned Parenthood, Wikipedia page for step 2: Planned Parenthood Practioners, Wikipedia page for step 3: HIPAA, not_definitive_answer: False, incorrect_answer: False&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task you are given a disfluent question, a proper question and a context.

Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, the input is a set of dialogues between a user and an assistant.

The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \&quot;a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\&quot; The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \&quot;this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\&quot;. Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \&quot;claque\&quot; of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \&quot;There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\&quot;. He considered that on every page the score displayed \&quot;the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\&quot;. Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \&quot;Nevertheless\&quot;, he wrote, \&quot;there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\&quot;. Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \&quot;The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\&quot;, he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \&quot;I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\&quot;. The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father that the opera was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day, such as Auber and Thomas, were capable of producing.In its initial run Les pêcheurs de perles ran for 18 performances, alternating with Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. It closed on 23 November 1863, and although it brought the theatre little financial success, Bizet had won admiration from his peers. Carvalho was satisfied enough to ask Bizet to quickly finish Ivan IV, with a view to its early production at the Théâtre Lyrique. This idea eventually came to nothing; Ivan IV remained unperformed until 1946. \nQuestion: Whose father was told that Les pêcheurs de perles was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day were capable of producing?&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Émile Paladilhe.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign.

Although endogenous mRNA is also 5 0 -triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5 0 -ppp-linked methylguanosine ( m7 G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5 0 -terminal nucleotide (N 1 ) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N 1 -2 0 O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2 0 O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a new role for cap N 1 -2 0 O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA.&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A Conserved Histidine in the RNA Sensor RIG-I Controls Immune Tolerance to N 1 -2 0 O-Methylated Self RNA Article A Conserved Histidine in the RNA Sensor RIG-I Controls Immune Tolerance to N 1 -2 0 O-Methylated Self RNA&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You will be given a passage consisting of set of facts and a question as input.

L'imperi hittita va ser destruït. El 1184 aC van tornar a Egipte, d'on en van ser expulsats el 1175 aC. Després d'això, una part s'establí a la Toscana, Sicília, Sardenya, Còrsega i potser el sud-est de la península Ibèrica, i uns altres van fundar estats a tota la costa de la Mediterrània Oriental. Es creu que emigrants que venien de Sardenya van arribar cap al 1250 aC a la península Ibèrica, probablement expulsats de l'illa per un dels grups dels pobles de la mar, els sherden, que van donar nom a l'illa de Sardenya i s'hi van establir després de ser derrotats pels egipcis.[1]

To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. "not_definitive_answer" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion."incorrect_answer" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.

 disfluent question: Colonialism often means a country doing which um I mean what? 
 context: Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.</span></div></div>

Sent 2: The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10.
Sent 3: Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108.
Sent 4: The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington.
Sent 5: Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state.
Sent 6: Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money.
Sent 7: ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said.
Sent 8: Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session.
Sent 9: Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing.
Sent 10: ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said.
Sent 11: The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association.
Sent 12: The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer.
Sent 13: Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said.
Sent 14: ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.''Sent 15: Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved.
Sent 16: ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said. 
Question: The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would increase court filing fees in what state?.</span></div></div>

that's where i was wrong.

on the second day i went on a boat trip. they just take a hundred people out on a boat, give us food and alcohol, and dump us out at random places in the sea. they didn't even take names or count people, so someone probably got lost. wasn't me, don't worry. 

i did a belly flop from a three metre platform into the sea. that was fun.

anyway, it turns out it's really difficult to rub sun cream on to a hairy back. it all just gets stuck in the hair and none of it gets on to the skin. i got very very badly burned. i haven't been able to lie on my back the last two nights. i had huge blisters which have since burst and leaked pus on to pretty much everything i own. my back just won't stop leaking. neither will my scalp, where it's equally impossible to apply sun cream.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a "claque" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: "There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music". He considered that on every page the score displayed "the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. "Nevertheless", he wrote, "there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: "The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: "I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues". The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father that the opera was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day, such as Auber and Thomas, were capable of producing.In its initial run Les pêcheurs de perles ran for 18 performances, alternating with Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. It closed on 23 November 1863, and although it brought the theatre little financial success, Bizet had won admiration from his peers. Carvalho was satisfied enough to ask Bizet to quickly finish Ivan IV, with a view to its early production at the Théâtre Lyrique. This idea eventually came to nothing; Ivan IV remained unperformed until 1946.

 Here are the defications of each category: 
 1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column 
 6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows. 
 Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: 
 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 
 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 
 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 
 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 
 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 
 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 
 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 
 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 
 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 
 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 
 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.

Although endogenous mRNA is also 5 0 -triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5 0 -ppp-linked methylguanosine ( m7 G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5 0 -terminal nucleotide (N 1 ) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N 1 -2 0 O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2 0 O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a new role for cap N 1 -2 0 O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA.</span></div></div>
