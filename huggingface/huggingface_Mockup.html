The numbers one through ten, plus the court cards, each carry a general energy that can help you better understand the messages of the Minor Arcana: Aces represent beginnings. They indicate initiative, drive, potential, and the earliest stages of an endeavor. Twos carry messages of balance and dichotomy. When a Two arises in your Tarot reading, you cannot move forward until equilibrium is reached. Threes are about communication and interactions. They indicate the influence that others have over your life, work, and emotions. The four cards represent a break or rest period. In order to move forward, you need to stop now and contemplate where you've been, and where you're going. The fives are cards of adversity. These cards indicate conflict, loss, and other negative experiences in your life that must be overcome. Sixes represent growth overcoming challenges, leaving bad situations behind, and gaining a greater understanding of who you are right now. The seven cards teach that you must have faith in yourself and the universe. There are many things happening to you, but confidence, determination, and truth will see you through. Eights are cards of work and change. These cards tell you that the only way to get where you want to be is to change what you're doing right now. The nines represent fruition. Things are coming together, and you may or may not like what you see now. The tens are about final outcomes and the end of a current cycle. They carry messages about the rewards or consequences you'll experience for the amount of work you've put in. The Page cards represent messages and beginnings. The Pages indicate a new phase where you know what you want to do, but not how to do it. These cards tell you to gather all the information you can before you take your next steps. The Knights are all about movement. You know where you're going, and the Knights tell you it's time to set your wheels in motion. The Queen cards are feminine messages of power, potential, and advice. These cards often advise you to seek the help of a wiser, more experienced person. The Kings flex their muscles with authority and power. These cards tell you that you have what it takes to succeed, but you must believe in everything that you are.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Minor Arcana Tarot Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;By the numbers&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Ace of Cups shows a hand holding up an overflowing cup, which fountains forth an endless stream of refreshment and healing.

This card highlights a karmic tie between individuals -- the point when two become one, and everyone wins. When the Two of Cups appears in your Tarot reading, put your focus on the closest relationship in your life, and nurture it in every way you can.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Cups Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Two of Cups&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Three of Cups calls on you to celebrate the kindred spirits in your life.

When the Three of Cups turns up in your Tarot reading, it asks you to realize all the support and understanding that is available to you.

When the Four of Cups comes up in your Tarot reading, beware becoming so self-absorbed and ungrateful that you cannot even see the joyful opportunities that are right in front of you. A more open outlook can change everything.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Cups Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Four of Cups&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Five of Cups traditionally portrays the mess that is left after an emotional upheaval.

When the Five of Cups appears in your Tarot reading, you may find yourself wallowing in regret and disappointment over the outcome of a particular situation. To change these feelings, you must let go and practice forgiveness -- toward others, and yourself. Hope is not lost; let your troubles become lessons, and move on.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Cups Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Five of Cups&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Six of Cups harkens back to childhood, when you were young and enthusiastic and the future was wide open. It carries messages of openness and innocence, a willingness to learn, and an optimism that things will get better. If the Six of Cups shows up in your Tarot reading, try to remember this same freshness and those new possibilities -- they are still with you now. Whether your past was a joy or a disappointment, real magic lies in the present moment; it's never too late.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Cups Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Six of Cups&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Seven of Cups typically refers to your imagination, and the idea of inventing a present or future that is different than the life you are currently living. This card reminds you that your outcome is not set in stone. You can raise your hopes and expectations and upgrade your results. However, you can also become so entranced by your wishes that you lose sight of reality.

Again, it will be more likely if both members of the couple share the exchange, but even if it's only one-way, remain cautious. Remember, if you and your love share one of these inter-aspects, it doesn't have to be a relationship deal-breaker. The key is awareness and a willingness to work through any difficulty together. If, however, your synastry is overwhelmed with several difficult links, the personal cost of remaining together might not be worth it. Love, after all, isn't supposed to hurt. *Note: The square and opposition are primarily considered the adverse links. If you have a sextile or trine aspect between planets, their energies work beautifully. If you have a conjunction, it's an intensification of energies and you want to carefully consider the other aspects between you before you judge whether the conjunction is beneficial or stressful.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ROMANTIC INCOMPATIBILITY: Red Flags in Synastry&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mars-Pluto&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:62,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Indicates a positive outcome If you receive the Yes outcome in your Yes or No Tarot Reading, you are being given a clear indication that you can move ahead in the direction indicated.

A little forethought can keep you from storming around aimlessly and help guide you in the right direction.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Swords Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Knight of Swords&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Queen of Swords knows what she wants. She is smart, honest, self-sufficient, and independent. She is not a conformer and is too wise to be confined to traditional roles. When the Queen of Swords arises in your Tarot reading, it's a message to act with independence and to fight for yourself. Never let anyone mold you into something different -- be strong and stand up for all that you are.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Swords Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Queen of Swords&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:94,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The King of Swords is a force of wisdom. He does not carry an emotional air -- his strength lies in the mind, in intelligence, truth, and fairness. He has gained his knowledge through much experience, and approaches life in an objective way that garners respect from those around him. While the King of Swords can seem cool or detached, he is here to offer great support. When this card comes up in your Tarot reading, you may be in the position of lending guidance to others, or could benefit from asking for advice yourself. When you seek guidance from the King of Swords, you can expect nothing but the truth.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Swords Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;King of Swords&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Ace of Pentacles is usually pictured with a garden or agricultural backdrop to emphasize its connection to Earth, and the potential of this Ace to serve as a seed of future fulfillment. If your talents are planted and tended carefully, this seed will sprout and reward you with a good harvest. The Ace represents the first step to your goal, but if that step is repeated, it can cover great distances. When the Ace of Pentacles arises in your Tarot reading, it is a message of support, and advises that you move gradually, steadily, and with intention in order to reach your long-term goals.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Pentacles Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ace of Pentacles&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Two of Pentacles generally features a figure juggling, with two Pentacles flying about him in figure-eight fashion. It is clear that until one or the other Pentacle drops, the final call cannot be made; there is more to learn before an action can be taken. Therefore, the Two of Pentacles counsels patience, so do not allow circumstances to hustle you. You have all the time you need to work this out, no matter how urgent things appear right now. When the Two of Pentacles comes up in your Tarot reading, changes are in the works, but you will do better to stay calm until you have more information. Everything is in flux.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Pentacles Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Two of Pentacles&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Three of Pentacles is traditionally the Tarot card of genius. It often depicts a master craftsman consulting with his colleagues on how to complete a masterwork. On occasion, the genius is portrayed at his studio, alone and burning the midnight oil in a creative ferment. When the Three of Pentacles arises in your Tarot reading, it is a message to enjoy what you do, and to stay focused on the task at hand. Through realistic plans, collaboration, and a dedication to improvement, you can turn your great visions into realities.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Pentacles Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Three of Pentacles&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Four of Pentacles represents the paradox of material security -- the double-edged reality that comes when you have been well supported and protected, yet this prosperity brings the pressure of big decisions and responsibilities. This card urges you to adopt skills to sensibly handle your finances and your environment, and to not be daunted by surprise developments. When this Tarot card arises in your reading, it is a message to make sound judgements -- do not waste, but do not cling, either. Disconnect your self-worth from your material worth. You may be holding on too tightly, trying desperately to maintain control, and would benefit by loosening your attachment to your finances and other materialistic concerns; these are not the ways to true contentment.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Pentacles Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Four of Pentacles&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Five of Pentacles is the card of desire and gratification. Doing something for short-term gratification will often lead to long-term disappointment. This Tarot card encourages you to be discerning in what you go after. When money and success are your driving forces in life, a setback in these areas can deliver a great blow to your esteem. Or maybe you've neglected the people in your life who've helped you get where you are, and now feel unhappy and alone. Money is a part of life, but don't let it be your whole life -- the Five of Pentacles reminds you that riches come in many different forms.&quot;},&quot;Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tarot Suits: The Pentacles Cards&quot;},&quot;Section_Title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Five of Pentacles&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:36852,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzA3MCwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL01vY2t1cC9hdXRvdHJhaW4tZGF0YS13cml0aW5nIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTI2NjcwLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.OslnXYn74vZZtRUnnb_bT-xxJyVmLlg0-9o7QNqN8i83hP_7yiLnZojIfR3G0MP_Ueltj_j2zfK23hQy0Ud5DA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;Mockup/autotrain-data-writing&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;63e303cf5dd0688d9362b20f&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/a5e7585700d860b35519fe0e78fcf3fb.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Bonnie Roseberry&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mockup&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

The numbers one through ten, plus the court cards, each carry a general energy that can help you better understand the messages of the Minor Arcana: Aces represent beginnings. They indicate initiative, drive, potential, and the earliest stages of an endeavor. Twos carry messages of balance and dichotomy. When a Two arises in your Tarot reading, you cannot move forward until equilibrium is reached. Threes are about communication and interactions. They indicate the influence that others have over your life, work, and emotions. The four cards represent a break or rest period. In order to move forward, you need to stop now and contemplate where you've been, and where you're going. The fives are cards of adversity. These cards indicate conflict, loss, and other negative experiences in your life that must be overcome. Sixes represent growth overcoming challenges, leaving bad situations behind, and gaining a greater understanding of who you are right now. The seven cards teach that you must have faith in yourself and the universe. There are many things happening to you, but confidence, determination, and truth will see you through. Eights are cards of work and change. These cards tell you that the only way to get where you want to be is to change what you're doing right now. The nines represent fruition. Things are coming together, and you may or may not like what you see now. The tens are about final outcomes and the end of a current cycle. They carry messages about the rewards or consequences you'll experience for the amount of work you've put in. The Page cards represent messages and beginnings. The Pages indicate a new phase where you know what you want to do, but not how to do it. These cards tell you to gather all the information you can before you take your next steps. The Knights are all about movement. You know where you're going, and the Knights tell you it's time to set your wheels in motion. The Queen cards are feminine messages of power, potential, and advice. These cards often advise you to seek the help of a wiser, more experienced person.

Ultimately, a link such as this can lead to resentment and anger. The Mars person wants to go and the Saturn person wants caution. Timing always seems to be off for this couple, and it may also express itself in the bedroom because Mars rules our libido.</span></div></div>

Again, it will be more likely if both members of the couple share the exchange, but even if it's only one-way, remain cautious. Remember, if you and your love share one of these inter-aspects, it doesn't have to be a relationship deal-breaker. The key is awareness and a willingness to work through any difficulty together. If, however, your synastry is overwhelmed with several difficult links, the personal cost of remaining together might not be worth it. Love, after all, isn't supposed to hurt. *Note: The square and opposition are primarily considered the adverse links. If you have a sextile or trine aspect between planets, their energies work beautifully. If you have a conjunction, it's an intensification of energies and you want to carefully consider the other aspects between you before you judge whether the conjunction is beneficial or stressful.</span></div></div>

It often depicts a master craftsman consulting with his colleagues on how to complete a masterwork. On occasion, the genius is portrayed at his studio, alone and burning the midnight oil in a creative ferment. When the Three of Pentacles arises in your Tarot reading, it is a message to enjoy what you do, and to stay focused on the task at hand. Through realistic plans, collaboration, and a dedication to improvement, you can turn your great visions into realities.</span></div></div>

This card urges you to adopt skills to sensibly handle your finances and your environment, and to not be daunted by surprise developments. When this Tarot card arises in your reading, it is a message to make sound judgements -- do not waste, but do not cling, either. Disconnect your self-worth from your material worth. You may be holding on too tightly, trying desperately to maintain control, and would benefit by loosening your attachment to your finances and other materialistic concerns; these are not the ways to true contentment.</span></div></div>

Doing something for short-term gratification will often lead to long-term disappointment. This Tarot card encourages you to be discerning in what you go after. When money and success are your driving forces in life, a setback in these areas can deliver a great blow to your esteem. Or maybe you've neglected the people in your life who've helped you get where you are, and now feel unhappy and alone. Money is a part of life, but don't let it be your whole life -- the Five of Pentacles reminds you that riches come in many different forms.</span></div></div>
