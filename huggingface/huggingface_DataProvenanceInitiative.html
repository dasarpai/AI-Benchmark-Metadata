The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?\nA: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs. The answer is 584.\nQuestion: Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week using a detergent pod for each load. His detergent pods come 39 to a pack. How many packs of detergent pods will he need to do a full year of laundry?\nAnswer: He uses 3 detergent pods a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses 3 * 52 = 156. His detergent has 39 pods per pack and he needs 156 pods, so he will need 156 / 39 = 4 packs of detergent pods. The answer is 4.\n[Question]John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob. If Bob has 10 roommates, how many roommates does John have?\n[Answer]Twice ten roommates is 2 * 10 = 20. John has 5 more than 20 roommates which is 20 + 5 = 25 roommates. The answer is 25.\nQ: Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams. Together, they have $150. How much money, in dollars, does Jackson have?\nA: Let x be the amount of money Williams has. Jackson has 5 * x dollars. 5 * x + x = 150. 6 * x = 150. x = 25. Jackson has 25 * 5 = 125 dollars. The answer is 125.\nQuestion: There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?\nAnswer: After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days. After the 100 people leave, there will be 300 - 100 = 200 people left. The 200 people will eat 200 / 300 = 2 / 3 as much food as the original group of people in the castle. The 60 days' worth of food will last this smaller group for 60 days / (2 / 3) = 90 more days. The answer is 90.\nQ: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May.

The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs.\nThe answer is 584.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nTo let Ruth know how long her fish will live, her father tells her that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs live.

If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.\nAnswer: If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26 - 4 = 22. John also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22 - 6 = 16 pink hard hats in the truck. If John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. The total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15 - 12 = 3. In the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = 19 hard hats in the truck. Altogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = 43 hard hats remained in the truck.

Andy buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, but half the total minks are set free by activists. How many coats can he make?\nA: First find the total number of baby minks: 30 minks * 6 babies / mink = 180 minks. Add this to the number of adult minks: 180 minks + 30 minks = 210 minks. Then divide this number in half to find how many aren't set free: 210 minks / 2 = 105 minks. Then divide the remaining number of minks by the number of minks per coat to find the number of coats: 105 minks / 15 minks / coat = 7 coats. The answer is 7.\nQuestion: With one mighty blow, Maria cracked open the pinata, and candies spilled all over the floor. There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?\nAnswer: Three times the number of red candies is 40 * 3 = 120. So, for yellow candies, there were 20 less than 120 candies, or a total of. 120 - 20 = 100 yellow candies. Half as many blue candies as yellow candies is 100 / 2 = 50 blue candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, then only the 40 red and 50 blue candies remained for a total of 40 + 50 = 90 candies. The answer is 90.\n[Question]Martin is organizing a party, and he invited many of his colleagues. He invited 5 people from his hometown and twice as many people from his school. Martin invited also as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. How many people can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing?\n[Answer]Martin invited 5 * 2 = 10 people from his school. People from the sports club got 5 + 10 = 15 invitations. So in total from the sports club, hometown and school, Martin invited 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 people. All other invitations are 20% of the previous total, which means 20 / 100 * 30 = 6. That means Martin invited to his party 30 + 6 = 36 people. The answer is 36.\nQ: A bulk warehouse is offering 48 cans of sparkling water for $12.00 a case. The local grocery store is offering the same sparkling water for $6.00 and it only has 12 cans. How much more expensive, per can, in cents, is this deal at the grocery store?\nA: The bulk warehouse has 48 cans for $12.00 so that's 12 / 48 = $0.25 a can. The local grocery store has 12 cans for $6.00 so that's 6 / 12 = $0.50 a can. The grocery store offer is $0.50 a can and the warehouse is $0.25 a can so the grocery store is .50 - .25 = $0.25 more expensive per can.

Baby, the younger of two daughters, plans to study economics in underdeveloped countries and enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake, is the doctor and friend of Max Kellerman, the resort proprietor. Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor, Johnny Castle, and meets his cousin, Billy. The staff holds secret after-hours parties in their quarters, and Baby is surprised by their \&quot;dirty dancing\&quot;.

Despite his hard outer shell, he is revealed to have a sensitive personality, developing feelings of guilt over using his new-found companions to his own ends. Garry Shandling as Verne, a naturally cynical ornate box turtle, the leader of the foragers. He has his own ways of doing the daily tasks, but his world is turned upside-down when RJ introduces his free-spirited lifestyle into the mix. Though Verne genuinely cares for his family, he tends to condescend to them. A couple of running gags throughout the film are everyone calling him an amphibian and him correcting them with reptile (though Dwayne already knew he was a reptile, but first mistook him as an amphibian), as well as his shell constantly falling off. Steve Carell as Hammy, a hyperactive American red squirrel, whose mouth moves as fast as his feet and loves cookies. He is naive and childish in nature, with an extremely short attention span. The double entendre of Hammy's constantly trying to find his nuts is a third running gag in the film. Wanda Sykes as Stella, a short-tempered, sassy striped skunk who is constantly being told by the other foragers that she needs a man in her life. Eugene Levy as Lou, a North American porcupine father and family patriarch with an overly friendly and optimistic attitude.

The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?
A: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs. The answer is 584.

Question: There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?
Answer: After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days. After the 100 people leave, there will be 300 - 100 = 200 people left. The 200 people will eat 200 / 300 = 2 / 3 as much food as the original group of people in the castle. The 60 days' worth of food will last this smaller group for 60 days / (2 / 3) = 90 more days. The answer is 90.

[Question]Jenny's local library received 50 visitors on Monday. On Tuesday, the library received twice that number. On the remaining days of the week, an average of 20 visitors went to the library. What's the total number of visitors who went to the library that week?
[Answer]On Monday, there were 50 visitors. On Tuesday, there were twice as many, so 2 * 50 = 100 visitors. The total number of visitors after Tuesday will be 100 + 50 = 150 visitors. For the remaining 5 days, an average of 20 visitors attended, giving a total of 5 * 20 = 100 visitors. The total number of visitors who visited the library for the week was 100 + 150 = 250 visitors. The answer is 250.

Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?
Step-by-step reasoning process: They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets for small children. They'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets for older children. They'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets for the adults. And they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets for the seniors. Along with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets. So they will need 2 * 292 = 584 eggs.
The answer is 584.

Answer the following question.
To let Ruth know how long her fish will live, her father tells her that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs live. On average, dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters live. And hamsters live an average of 2.5 years. How long can a fish live?
Step-by-step reasoning process: Knowing that dogs live 4 times the age of hamsters, dogs live 4 * 2.5 = 10 years. If Ruth takes care of the fish, it can live 10 + 2 = 12 years.
The answer is 12.

Yeon's number of watermelon seeds is three times as many as the number that Gwi has, meaning Yeon has 3 * 340 = 1020 watermelon seeds. Together, the three friends have 1020 + 640 = 1660 watermelon seeds. The answer is 1660.

Question: In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.
Answer: If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26 - 4 = 22. John also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22 - 6 = 16 pink hard hats in the truck. If John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. The total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15 - 12 = 3. In the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = 19 hard hats in the truck. Altogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = 43 hard hats remained in the truck. The answer is 43.

Q: Every Sunday, Sean picks up 1 almond croissant and 1 salami and cheese croissant that are $4.50 each. He also grabs a plain croissant for $3.00 and a loaf of focaccia for $4.00. On his way home he stops and picks up 2 lattes for $2.50 each. How much did he spend?
A: The almond croissant and the salami and cheese croissant are $4.50 each so that's 2 * 4.50 = $9.00. He buys 2 lattes that are $2.50 each so that's 2 * 2.50 = $5.00. The flavored croissants are $9.00, the lattes are $5.00 and he also grabbed a plain croissant for $3.00 and focaccia for $4.00 for a total of 9 + 5 + 3 + 4 = $21.00. The answer is 21.
Question: Steve owns a lake shop that sells fish. He has a stock of 200 fish. He sells 50 fish and because his refrigerators stop working a third of the remaining fish become spoiled. A new stock of 200 more fish arrives. How many fish does he have in stock now?
Answer: If he had 200 fish and sells 50, he is left with 200 - 50 = 150 fish. If a third of them get spoiled 1 / 3 * 150 = 50 fish get spoiled. The remaining number of fish is now 150 - 50 = 100. He then gets 200 more to make 100 + 200 = 300 fish. The answer is 300.

Q: It takes 15 mink skins to make a coat. Andy buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, but half the total minks are set free by activists. How many coats can he make?
A: First find the total number of baby minks: 30 minks * 6 babies / mink = 180 minks. Add this to the number of adult minks: 180 minks + 30 minks = 210 minks. Then divide this number in half to find how many aren't set free: 210 minks / 2 = 105 minks. Then divide the remaining number of minks by the number of minks per coat to find the number of coats: 105 minks / 15 minks / coat = 7 coats. The answer is 7.
Question: With one mighty blow, Maria cracked open the pinata, and candies spilled all over the floor. There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?
Answer: Three times the number of red candies is 40 * 3 = 120. So, for yellow candies, there were 20 less than 120 candies, or a total of. 120 - 20 = 100 yellow candies. Half as many blue candies as yellow candies is 100 / 2 = 50 blue candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, then only the 40 red and 50 blue candies remained for a total of 40 + 50 = 90 candies. The answer is 90.
[Question]Martin is organizing a party, and he invited many of his colleagues. He invited 5 people from his hometown and twice as many people from his school. Martin invited also as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. How many people can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing?
[Answer]Martin invited 5 * 2 = 10 people from his school. People from the sports club got 5 + 10 = 15 invitations. So in total from the sports club, hometown and school, Martin invited 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 people. All other invitations are 20% of the previous total, which means 20 / 100 * 30 = 6. That means Martin invited to his party 30 + 6 = 36 people. The answer is 36.
Q: A bulk warehouse is offering 48 cans of sparkling water for $12.00 a case. The local grocery store is offering the same sparkling water for $6.00 and it only has 12 cans. How much more expensive, per can, in cents, is this deal at the grocery store?
A: The bulk warehouse has 48 cans for $12.00 so that's 12 / 48 = $0.25 a can. The local grocery store has 12 cans for $6.00 so that's 6 / 12 = $0.50 a can. The grocery store offer is $0.50 a can and the warehouse is $0.25 a can so the grocery store is .50 - .25 = $0.25 more expensive per can. The answer is 25.

Baby, the younger of two daughters, plans to study economics in underdeveloped countries and enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake, is the doctor and friend of Max Kellerman, the resort proprietor. Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor, Johnny Castle, and meets his cousin, Billy. The staff holds secret after-hours parties in their quarters, and Baby is surprised by their "dirty dancing". Intrigued, Baby receives a brief, impromptu dance lesson from Johnny.

Answer this question based on the passage: where is dirty dancing supposed to take place?

Student A:Bruce Willis as RJ, a raccoon who is duplicitous, selfish, and extremely intelligent. Despite his hard outer shell, he is revealed to have a sensitive personality, developing feelings of guilt over using his new-found companions to his own ends. Garry Shandling as Verne, a naturally cynical ornate box turtle, the leader of the foragers. He has his own ways of doing the daily tasks, but his world is turned upside-down when RJ introduces his free-spirited lifestyle into the mix. Though Verne genuinely cares for his family, he tends to condescend to them. A couple of running gags throughout the film are everyone calling him an amphibian and him correcting them with reptile (though Dwayne already knew he was a reptile, but first mistook him as an amphibian), as well as his shell constantly falling off. Steve Carell as Hammy, a hyperactive American red squirrel, whose mouth moves as fast as his feet and loves cookies. He is naive and childish in nature, with an extremely short attention span. The double entendre of Hammy's constantly trying to find his nuts is a third running gag in the film. Wanda Sykes as Stella, a short-tempered, sassy striped skunk who is constantly being told by the other foragers that she needs a man in her life. Eugene Levy as Lou, a North American porcupine father and family patriarch with an overly friendly and optimistic attitude. Catherine O'Hara as Penny, the porcupine family mother and matriarch; she serves as a ground between their family and the other animals. Shane Baumel, Sami Kirkpatrick, and Madison Davenport as Spike, Bucky and Quillo, Lou and Penny ′ s three identical children. They're big on video games and are the most enthusiastic about exploring the world beyond the hedge.

Based on this passage, who does bruce willis play in over the hedge?
Student B:OK... To answer this question, we should know that: Bruce Willis as RJ, a raccoon who is duplicitous, selfish, and extremely intelligent.
RJ , a raccoon who is duplicitous , selfish , and extremely intelligent.

Student A:Passage: According to historian Saul Cornell, states passed some of the first gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky's law to "curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in 1813." There was opposition and, as a result, the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws, in keeping with this new "pervasive spirit of individualism." As noted by Cornell, "Ironically, the first gun control movement helped give birth to the first self-conscious gun rights ideology built around a constitutional right of individual self-defense."

Question: Based on this passage, when was the first gun law passed in the us?
Student B:OK... To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: According to historian Saul Cornell, states passed some of the first gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky's law to "curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in 1813."
1813.

Student A:In aerobic organisms the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the mitochondria via the electron transport chain. In addition to energy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the potential to cause cellular damage are produced. ROS can damage lipid, DNA, RNA, and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the physiology of aging.

Answer this question based on the passage: where are reactive oxygen species produced in the body?
