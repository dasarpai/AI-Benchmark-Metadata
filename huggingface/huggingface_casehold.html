Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb.

See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

Taylor v. Mill, 310 S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1992). Thus, this Court has already noted that section 6323 operates to establish priority, not extinguish ection in this manner will stifle tax sales, potential buyers must research tax sale property purchases and would be put on notice of any federal tax liens. Finally, Appellants argue that the master erred by not giving section 6323, a more specific statute, priority over section 7425, a general statute. See Capco of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H.

Mr. Norwood concedes that the guideline range would have remained the same based on the findings that the district court had made at sentencing. Appellant’s Opening Br. at 9. But Mr. Norwood challenges these findings, arguing that the district court violated the U.S. Constitution by failing to allow the jury to decide matters involving relevant conduct. In our view, this argument is not available under § 3582(c)(2). A § 3582(c)(2) motion is available to request a sentence reduction only for the sentencing range that was lowered by the Commission’s amendment, not to challenge other aspects of a defendant’s sentence.

Because dangerous people do not differentiate between misdemeanors and felonies, the law should not either. It is a fact that many officers are killed during traffic stops for mere infractions. But, here’s the rub: the facts are disputed, and the disputed facts here should have been submitted to the jury, even when qualified immunity from suit was an issue. Issues of credibility belong to the trier of fact. The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution so requires. Thompson v.

If a “special school” is to be compared to the ordinary local school and must only differ to some extent, then the Charter Schools Commission could create all sorts of commission charter schools that should satisfy constitutional scrutiny, even if the three charter schools at issue in this case are not “different” enough to satisfy the majority.

On appeal, N.S. argues that a parent in a dependency proceeding does not fall within the plain language of the statute, which provides as follows: A state self-insurance fund, designated as the “State Risk Management Trust Fund,” is created to be set up by the Department of Financial Services and administered with a program of risk management, which fund is to provide insurance, as authorized by s.

Under the mootness doctrine, this Court has no jurisdiction to render a judgment and opinion granting or denying either of those mooted motions.

Because Miles may reasonably have thought such a statement would decrease her practical exposure to criminal liability, the statement was not reliable as being against her penal interest. Cf. Williamson, 512 U.S. at 601, 114 S.Ct. at 2435 (stating that court “may not just assume ... that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of a fuller confession, and this is especially true when the statement implicates someone else”); id. at 604, 114 S.Ct. at 2437 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (<HOLDING>); Earnest, 87 F.3d at 1134 (noting that proper&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding improperly admitted testimony was cumulative to the other properly admitted evidence and was therefore harmless&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that codefendants statement was not properly admitted because a reasonable person in declarants position might even think that implicating someone else would decrease his practical exposure to criminal liability at least as far as sentencing goes&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that discrepancy between declarants testimony at preliminary hearing compared to his translated statement offered at trial went to weight not admissibility of statement&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that appellants statement i think i need a lawyer     is just as ambiguous as the statement made by the defendant in davis&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that when the testimony relating each of the statements by codefendants was admissible against at least one of the codefendants the statements were not rendered inadmissible because each statement would be hearsay as to the other two defendants&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:13,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;13&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;sentences for bank robbery consecutively or concurrent ly. However, the statute does not permit the court to decide whether any future sentence would be consecutive or concurrent to those five sentences. Rather, when sentences are imposed at different times, § 3584(a) only authorizes a court to determine whether a sentence should be consecutive or concurrent if the defendant is “already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.” 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a) (emphasis added). Another sentence must exist at the time a district court imposes its sentence; a court cannot impose its sentence consecutively to a sentence that does not yet exist. The better-reasoned cases from our sister circuits have reached the same conclusion. See Romandine v. United States, 206 F.3d 731, 738 (7th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Plaintiff argued that no remedial action could take place until a final remedial plan had been officially approved. Id. at 811.

The anti-retaliation provision of the FCRA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a person for opposing an unlawful employment practice or for making a charge of discrimination. Fla. Stat. § 760.10(7). The district court correctly found that Jiles had not put forth any evidence to show a causal connection between the protected activity of his administrative charge of race discrimination in May 2006 and his January 2007 termination. Further, the district court did not err when it reasoned that the time-frame of eight months does not sufficiently proximate to establish a causal connection.

A party may move — at any time, even after judgment — to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that issue. By its plain terms, Rule 15(b)(2) only applies to claims that are tried, and this case was disposed of on summary judgment. Further, Doan did not consent to trying the handcuffing claim — he objected to the claim in both his motion for summary judgment and at oral argument on that motion. Cf. Siler v.

In other words, Mr. Jones cannot establish a causal link between his allegedly protected activity and UPS’s refusal to return him to work unless he can show that UPS knew he was engaging in protected activity.

First, it appears that defendant’s use of the past tense was a slip of the tongue because he was responding to a question asked of him in the present tense. In addition, he began his response with the word “currently.” Moreover, defendant’s lawyer, in his cross-examination of Lieutenant Commander Donald Ray Opedal, elicited testimony to the effect that defendant represented at the August 9, 1985 meeting that he was unemployed. Finally, the Court instructed the jurors that the arguments of counsel were not evidence and that their recollection of the evidence controlled. See, e.g., United States v.

Phillips argues in her brief that it is not necessary for her to prove chemotherapy would have saved the Decedent’s life. First, she refers to the fright and anxiety both she and the Decedent suffered because of the delay in chemotherapy. In this regard, Phillips confuses the causation issue. In a survival action, damages for the Decedent’s physical suffering and mental anxiety as a result of the alleged deprivation of medical care would have been appropriate. In a wrongful death context, however, no damages are available until the plaintiff has cleared the causation hurdle. See Wilks v. Am. Tobacco Co., 680 So.2d 839, 842 (Miss.1996) (<HOLDING>).

Did the plain error affect Thomas’s substantial rights? An error affects a defendant’s “substantial rights” if it is “prejudicial” and it “affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.” Gore, 154 F.3d at 47. “Though ‘prejudice’ is also required to show that an error is not ‘harmless,’ pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a), the important difference of plain error prejudice [in most cases] is that ‘[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of pers , 2001), with United States v.

Likewise, Plaintiffs requested injunctive relief — that the Individual Defendants change Plaintiffs grade and permit her to continue her studies at Hunger College — is purely prospective, as it would require state officials to take future action to prevent present and future harm. See Flint, 488 F.3d at 825. The fact that this injunction also remedies a past harm does not “render[ ] an otherwise forward-looking injunction retroactive. If it did, the rule allowing prospective relief would be substantially undermined because the need for prospective relief often arises out of a past injury.” Russell v.

That case involved an order that changed a custody order’s time-sharing arrangement to give one of the parties more time with the child, not a change in custody. As noted in Boykin, the test for proving entitlement to custody modification has two prongs: 1) whether there is a substantial and material change of circumstances; and 2) whether the child’s welfare will be promoted by a change in custody. The party seeking custody modification must overcome the “extraordinary burden of proving both elements.” 843 So.2d at 320.

In fact, Ms. Robinson’s testimony suggests that only the girls were subject to this more extensive search. 3 . The same standard applies here despite the presence of a law enforcement officer because, as found by the trial court, the search was conducted by school administrators and staff, and the school resource officer’s role was limited to observation, as he did not participate in the actual search.

Premier fully participated in the review, and has no control over it’s suppliers cooperation. Section 1677e(b) of Title 19 states that when Commerce finds “that an interested party failed to cooperate .. . [the agency] may use an” adverse inference. Premier’s suppliers are not interested parties. Therefore, the Court will not apply adverse facts to Premier as a result of its suppliers’ deficiencies. See generally Kompass Food Trading Int'l v.

Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the constitutional right allegedly violated was clearly established “before the defendant acted or failed to act.” Rice v. Burks, 999 F.2d 1172, 1174 (7th Cir.1993) (citing Rakovich v. Wade, 850 F.2d 1180 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 968, 109 S.Ct. 497, 102 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988)). This requires the plaintiff to offer either a closely analogous case or evidence that the defendants’ conduct is so patently violative of the constitutional right that reasonable officials would know without guidance from the courts.

Thus, any prejudice against the Defendant was at best minimal and could have been turned to the Defendant’s advantage by his counsel. Even if any prejudice did result, it most certainly did not permeate the entire trial and impact the result as it appears only once in the transcript and never was mentioned later during the trial. See United States v. Beckett, 706 F.2d 519, 520 (5th Cir.1983) (“Prosecutorial misconduct, fortunately occurring only occasionally, mars any trial in which it occurs and gives grounds for appeal. But a conviction should not be set aside if the prosecutor’s conduct, however, wrongful, did not in fact contribute to the guilty verdict and was, therefore, legally harmless.”); see also United States v.

Plaintiffs observe that after receiving-class notice in the ordinary case, a would-be class member cannot refuse to opt out and later object to class certification. Plaintiffs argue that through declining to opt out, the class member has in essence consented to the propriety of class certification. Courts have held, for example, that a decision not to opt out of a class should foreclose attacks on whether the class has adequate representation. See, e.g., Shore v. Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc., 606 F.2d 354, 357-58 (2d Cir.1979) (observing that right to opt-out of the proposed settlement protects class members’ interests from alleged inadequate representation); see also Torrisi v.

This distinction appears immaterial under the language of sec. 409.402(7), Stats. 7 In other contexts, a security interest properly perfected at one time may later become unperfected through creditor inaction. See, e.g. sec. 409.103(l)(d)l, (2)(b), (3)(e), Stats, (four month grace periods preserving perfection in collateral removed from jurisdic tion); sec. 409.403(2) (lapse of financing statements after 5 years unless continued). 8 Interestingly, the Ansley court held that a filing under \&quot;the name Ansley Farms instead of the debtor's true name — Emory Ansley — is seriously misleading, making [the]. . . security interest unperfected.. . .\&quot; Id,., 467 F.Supp. at 55.

The definition in the 1928 and 1949 Manuals was as follows: An attempt to commit a crime is an act done with intent to commit that particular crime, and forming part of a series of acts which will apparently, if not interrupted by circumstances independent of the doer’s will, result in its actual commission. Para. 152c, Manual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army, 1928; para. 183c, Manual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army, 1949. The Articles for the Government of the Navy also did not have any general statutory prohibition of attempts; but apparently they often were punishable as lesser-included offenses. See, e.g., section 91, Naval Courts and Boards, 1937 (<HOLDING>) According to naval law: If an attempt is not&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that where an agent is guilty of independent fraud for his benefit knowledge of the fraud is not imputed to the principal&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;recognizing attempted fraud as a lesserincluded offense of fraud in violation of article 14 for the government of the navy&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that under the pre1986 jurisdictional limitation a claim by the state which discovered the fraud investigated the fraud disclosed the fraud to the federal government and which was the original source of the information was jurisdictionally barred&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the issue of fraud was precluded because the previous jury necessarily considered fraud as the basis for chapter 93a liability&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a plaintiff cannot avoid the securities fraud exception by pleading mail fraud or wire fraud if the conduct giving rise to those offenses also amounts to securities fraud&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:42,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;42&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;unique facts and circumstances of each case” to determine whether an individual voluntarily consented to a search. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 233, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The district court’s sifting of the unique facts and circumstances in this case changed from its first order to its second order. When the district court reviewed the evidence through the lens of an unlawful seizure, it was then-and only then-the court found Loos’s and Escobar’s consents were constitutionally deficient. The district court properly considered the legal effect of the officer’s lie about the drug dog alerting when pondering whether Loos and Escobar voluntarily consented to the searches of their luggage. The Supreme Court has “stated that even when of 86, 1191 (8th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Realizing there is “a vast difference between&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a fiftynine minute detention to wait for a drug dog was reasonable where the officer requested the dog immediately after developing reasonable suspicion&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a district court did not clearly err in finding consent where two agents testified that the defendant orally consented but the defendant denied having orally consented and would not sign a written consent form&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that officers release of police dog to assist in arrest was discretionary act&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding district courts finding of consent was not clearly erroneous when the defendant consented after officers told him they could get a drug dog even though the defendant knew the dog would alert&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that defendant voluntarily consented where defendants only basis for coercion was that the officers said that if he did not consent they would get a warrant which would take a while&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:43,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;43&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;§ 6323(a), leave which is never afforded to nonmilitary personnel. Furthermore, the cases Defendants cite in support of their contention address situations in which employers had unilateral policies affording additional benefits or rights to absent military personnel. While courts have consistently held that employers do not commit a USERRA violation in revoking these extra benefits, these cases do not address USERRA rights provided by statute. See Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon, 567 F.3d 860, 865 (7th Cir.2009) (rescission of a flexible work scheduling program did not constitute a USERRA violation); Gross v. PPG Indus., Inc., 636 F.3d 884, 889 (7th Cir.2011) (rescission of differential pay policy did not violate US-ERRA); Welshans v. U.S. Postal Serv., 550 F.3d 1100, 1104 (Fed.Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>).

Baucom, 428 So.2d 1383, 1385 (Fla.1983). “In order to give timely notice of a charging lien an attorney should either file a notice of lien or otherwise pursue the lien in the original action.” Daniel Mones, P.A. v. Smith, 486 So.2d 559, 560 (Fla.1986) (citing Sinclair, Louis, 428 So.2d at 1385). Notice is timely where the charging hen is filed prior to entry of the final judgment. See Gaebe, Murphy, Mullen &amp; Antonelli v. Bradt, 704 So.2d 618 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997). Conversely, an attorney’s charging hen is untimely and may not be established in proceedings after final judgment has been entered. See Milio v. Leinoff &amp; Silvers, P.A., 668 So.2d 1108 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996) (<HOLDING>). Here, Mr. Johnson did not give notice of&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding premature notice of appeal was treated as entered on date of entry of final judgment&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding in part as a general rule a trial courts judgment becomes final thirty days after its entry unless a party files a timely notice of appeal or specified posttrial motion&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify its final order more than 30 days after its final judgment&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding attorney may not wait more than thirty days from the entry of final judgment give notice of nonrepresentation and then seek to enforce a hen not noticed before the entry of the final judgment&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a district court judgment is not a final judgment appealable by the defendant unless it includes the final adjudication and the final sentence&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:45,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;45&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;S.W.2d 759, 767 (Tex.Ciim.App.1973) (stating that seizure conducted within parameters of a valid search warrant did not violate defendant’s constitutional rights where officers acted in accordance with procedural guidelines). Accordingly, we overrule appellant’s third and fourth issues. In his fifth and sixth issues, appellant contends that the method of seizure violated the constitutional provisions prohibiting ex post facto laws found in article I, section 10, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 16 of the Texas Constitution. Ex post facto prohibitions apply to civil statutes only when the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.

In sum, the Court rejects Plaintiff's attempt to rely on this prior settlement discourse as a means to establish a viable amendment. 3 . Plaintiff could have amended her administrative claim at this time because the INS had not yet denied her claim. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). However, Plaintiff elected not to file an amendment. 4 . Plaintiff contends that Defendant has the burden of showing that Plaintiff's injury was not reasonably foreseeable when Plaintiff filed her administrative claim. (PL’s Reply at 2-3.) Plaintiff is wrong. It is well settled that a plaintiff has the burden of proving “newly discovered evidence\&quot; under 28 U.S.C. § 2675(b). See Milano v.

Here, Plaintiffs confessed the state claims against Cox for misrepresentation, breach of contract, and estoppel against Cox. They did not confess the remainder of causes of action against him, including the state claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. Because Cox was required to expend efforts beyond the filing of the motion to dismiss, an award of fees under § 13-17-201 is warranted.

Plaintiff cannot simply make a conclusory allegation that a conspiracy existed; rather, plaintiff must provide facts showing agreement and concerted action. Sooner Prods. Co. v. McBride, 708 F.2d 510, 512 (10th Cir.1983). In this case, plaintiffs allegation of a conspiracy, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for conspiracy.

When the trial court renders a judgment for the recovery of real property, the amount of “security must be at least ... the value of the property interest’s rent or revenue.” Tex.R.App. P. 24.2(a)(2)(A). Therefore, to determine the proper amount t did not hold an evidentiary hearing on Reyes’s motion to set superse-deas, a reporter’s record of the hearing was not required. Cf. Michiana Easy Livin’ Country, Inc. v. Holten, 168 S.W.3d 777, 782 (Tex.2005) (<HOLDING>).

This appeal is untimely only if the District Court’s 1993 decision — which ordered only that ISP submit a plan to remedy the constitutional flaws in its policy — was a final judgment, appealable to this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We believe that the District Court’s 1993 order was no more final under § 1291 than the one at issue in Sherpell v. Humnoke School Dist., 814 F.2d 538 (8th Cir.1987), which held that a district court order to a school district to submit a plan to remedy an unconstitutional atmosphere of racial hostility was not an appealable final judgment. Id. at 539; see also Hendrickson v. Griggs, 856 F.2d 1041, 1044 (8th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>).

If the government does not conform to the limitations placed upon the right granted to search, the search is impermissible. In justifying a consensual search, the government bears the burden of establishing that the search was conducted within the purview of the consent received. When an individual gives a general statement of consent without express limitations, the scope of a permissible search is not limitless. Rather it is constrained by the bounds of reasonableness: what a police officer could reasonably interpret the consent to encompass. United States v. Strickland, 902 F.2d 937, 941 (11th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). See also State v. Nabarro, 55 Haw. 583, 583-87, 525 P.2d 573, 574-75 (1974) (<HOLDING>) (internal quotation mark omitted).

D. Downward Departures Kornegay claims that the district court erroneously denied him a downward departure on either of two bases. Both departure arguments relate to the 14-month state drug conviction sentence which Kornegay served after the drug deal at issue in this case but before he was indicted. The first ground for departure was premised on the government’s delay in prosecuting Kornegay in order to protect Chaney from being detected as an informant. Kornegay argued that this delay foreclosed the possibility of his federal sentence running concurrently with his state sentence and that a departure should be granted so that he would not be prejudiced. See United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>).

In this case, the juvenile moved to dismiss at the original adjudicatory hearing because none of the State’s witnesses was present and, therefore, the State could not go forward with the hearing. The State acknowledged that it could'not go forward with the hearing and did not object to dismissal of the petition.

However, this conclusion cannot be squared with controlling precedent. The Supreme Court has expressly declined to recognize any “inherent power” on the part of a federal court to enforce a settlement agreement simply because the agreement resolved a federal proceeding.

Here, despite the majority’s conclusions to the contrary, the testimony provided on the record by the two transport officers was credible and, based on this evidence, it was within the trial court’s discretion to rule that defendant was competent to stand trial. Defendant has therefore failed to show prejudice. ¶ 35. Because defendant has not shown that any prejudice occurred from whatever errors the trial court may have made, any alleged violations of defendant’s due process rights are also harmless.

Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B), “administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.” We interpret this statute to call for review under the substantial evidence test, under which the IJ’s finding will be upheld if “supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole.” Elzour, 378 F.3d at 1150.

Here, no “manifest injustice” results from the denial of Seadinovski’s petition, as the relevant regulation provides that “[a] motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). As the plain language of the regulation provides, failure to comply with the requirement is a ground for denial of the motion. See Zhen Nan Lin v.

On this point, we also agree with Defendants.

Bankruptcy Rule 7013 is similarly unhelpful. While it concerns the filing of counterclaims and cross-claims, the rule does not cover their severance.

DiGiovanni’s continued investigation after issuing the warning was entirely reasonable in light of these factors. First, any detention incident to that investigation was of limited duration. The encounter between Rodriguez and law enforcement personnel, from the moment he was pulled over until the currency’s discovery, lasted approximately forty minutes. Under these circumstances, even if Rodriguez’s detention occupied that entire time interval, it might not suggest a Terry Stop of unreasonable scope. See United States v. McFarley, 991 F.2d 1188, 1194 (4th Cir. 1993) (<HOLDING>).

See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110-11, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990). In Osborne, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether Ohio could ban the possession of child pornography. Id. at 108, 110 S.Ct. 1691. In finding it could, the Court relied not only on the harm caused to the children who are used in its production (i.e., Ferber), but also on the harm that children suffer when child pornography is used to seduce or coerce them into sexual activity. Id. at 111, 110 S.Ct. 1691. Thus, in Osborne, the Court indicated that protecting children who are not actually pictured in the pornographic image is a legitimate and compelling state interest. See Id. See also United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 70 (1st Cir.)

Here, the claim is based on Chase’s failure to pay flood insurance premiums from the escrow account. Further, plaintiff alleges that defendant breached a duty that was owed to her specifically, not a general duty owed to the public. See Harrison v. Gore, 27,254 (La.App. 2 Cir.8/23/95); 660 So.2d 563, 568 (“The classical distinction between ‘damages ex contractu’ and ‘damages ex delicto’ is that the former flow from the breach of a special obligation contractually assumed by the obligor, whereas the latter flow from the violation of a general duty owed to all persons.”). The Court, therefore, finds that plaintiffs detrimental reliance claim sounds in contract and is subject to a ten-year prescriptive period. See Stokes v. Georgia-Pac. Corp., 894 F.2d 764, 770 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, plaintiffs claim has not&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding in the context of a non  212c iirira retroactivity challenge that if reliance were required we would insist at most upon objectively reasonable reliance and not subjective reliance&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that reasonable reliance is not an element of the defense&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that under ohio law fraud claim failed because there was no evidence of reliance&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding detrimental reliance claim was subject to tenyear prescriptive period&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that each class member was not required to prove justifiable reliance when an inference of reliance arises if a materially false representation was made to persons whose acts thereafter were consistent with reliance upon the representations&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:78,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;78&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;under § 3730(e)(4)(A). Finally, we consider whether the GAO report was a “public disclosure” under § 3730(e)(4)(A). The GAO report disclosed generally that some contractors performing the 254 ESPCs granted between 1999 and 2003 had engaged in the activity Relators allege is fraudulent, but the report did not disclose the names of any contractors or specify any locations where an ESPC may have involved fraud. Because of the large number of ESPCs granted and the GAO report’s lack of specificity, the report did not contain sufficient information to enable the government to pursue an investigation against Honeywell. Accordingly, the GAO report was not a “public disclosure” under § 3730(e)(4)(A). See United States v. Alcan Elec. and Eng’g, Inc., 197 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>).

See Perry II, 671 F.3d at 1088, 2012 WL 372713, at *21 (“There is no rational reason to think that taking away the designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples would advance the goal of encouraging ... opposite-sex couples to procreate more responsibly.”) To the extent some people may have a bias in favor of preferring biological parents over other couples, there is no such recognition of this distinction under federal or state law. See id. There has been no showing that DOMA alters any state or federal law governing childbearing, procreation or family structure. Given the state of the law, the rationale of promoting responsible child-rearing finds no “ ‘footing in t 85, 186 (1971) (<HOLDING>)). Again, the argument that the definition of&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding in a case involving not intraunion politics but rather a matter of an employer requiring the union to carry out the penalty provision of a collective bargaining agreement that the statutory term otherwise disciplined is narrowly confined to regulatory actions that affect a union members rights or status as a member of the union that the sanctions imposed were employmentrelated rather than internal union related and that the safeguards in  411a5 were not available for such action&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the law to be applied in determining the validity of  an outofstate marriage is the law of the state in which the marriage occurred&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a vermont civil union is not the equivalent of a marriage&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that as long as alleged breach of a continuing duty occurred within six years of the filing of the lawsuit the claim is timely&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the institution of marriage as a union of man and woman uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family is as old as the book of genesis&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:80,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;80&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;did wrong, and when. The target is not required to play a guessing game in that respect.”). Once Defendants cured the specific problems identified in Plaintiffs’ Notice, if Plaintiffs believed that Defendants remained in violation and wanted to motivate Defendants to change their conduct with the possibility of a citizen suit, Plaintiffs needed to provide Defendants’ with another notice, one with sufficient information to address the problems that would eventually be the subject of a federal lawsuit. The Court rejects the idea it is foisting an impossible burden on Plaintiffs by requiring that this suit be supported by a notice containing details not available at the time of the first (and only) Notice. That Notice was good, but just not for the claims Plaint 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). B.

Defendants further argue that FWS is entitled to summary judgment on the remaining part of Count VIII alleging that BLM and FWS consultations on the proposed leasing program and decision to proceed were inadequate because they failed to consider the impacts on critical habitat. The parties agree that plaintiffs’ claim that FWS violated the ESA by failing to designate critical habitat for the spectacled eider and the Steller’s eider is moot. The parties disagree as to whether that claim should be dismissed with or without prejudice. A dismissal on mootness grounds is without prejudice to future suits on the merits of the same claim.

The judge also cut off Henson's attorney somewhat abruptly when he requested an opportunity to argue on the issue of damages, but Henson has not raised this or any other procedural issue on appeal. 10 . It appears that Prue's premises may have been in the nature of a rooming house, and Henson may have been a roomer rather than a tenant. If he was, then the prohibition against self-help evictions may not have been applicable. Cf. Harkins v. Win Corp., 771 A.2d 1025, 1029 (D.C.2001) (<HOLDING>).

The physical taking issue turns on the court’s interpretation of the requirements arising under the WARA and is an issue of law that can be adjudicated on a motion for summary judgment.

Even McGreal found the purportedly missing reports in the Liquor Commission files. Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks also point out that McGreal filed Judicial Inquiry Board complaint about Judge Sterba without fully investigating the circumstances. McGreal’s letter highlighted the differences between the sentence that Sean Taylor actually received and the one that Lt. Snooks related to McGreal. McGreal then drew the inference that these differences were in response to McGreal’s initial inquiries into the matter, instead of a simple mistake on the part of Lt. Snooks. Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks argue that McGreal’s speech was motivated by personal interests in making these statements, and therefore the First Amendment does not protect the speech.

The trial judge has permitted the plaintiff to replead a separate fraud count, the allegations of which essentially duplicate the ones above. Fraud is a distinct cause of action in Illinois. To that extent, we do not believe the allegations of fraud are germane to a count alleging professional negligence, be it that of a psychotherapist or a cleric. Cf. Williams v. Chicago Osteopathic Health Systems, 274 Ill. App. 3d 1039, 1048, 654 N.E.2d 613 (1995) (<HOLDING>).

In the instant case, as the district court admitted and as seems readily apparent, the error was based on inadvertence. Thus, Rule 60(b)(1), with its one year time limitation, clearly applied. The district court attempted to circumvent the apparent harshness of the one year limitation by reading Rule 60(b)(6) as permitting nd Procedure § 2864 (1973).

Jefferson Lighthouse Sch., 98 F.3d&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that school officials could prevent a student from distributing invitations in a public elementary school a nonpublic forum because the restraint was reasonable&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the courthouse lobby was a nonpublic forum&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a federal charity drive a nonpublic forum could limit participation to a number of select charities as long as the restriction was reasonable and viewpointneutral&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a statesponsored televised election debate was a nonpublic forum and state officials could exercise broad editorial discretion in deciding which candidates to invite as long as the decisions were reasonable and viewpointneutral&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a courthouse was a nonpublic forum but an unenclosed courthouse plaza was a designated public forum&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:96,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;96&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;who wore beards as a matter of their religious obligation. See id. at 360-61. This kind of unequal treatment, the Court of Appeals held, “indicates that the [police department] has made a value judgment that secular (i.e., medical) motivations for wearing a beard are important enough to overcome its general interest in uniformity, but that religious motivations are not.” Id. at 366. Subsections (b)(1) and (2) are also rooted in Establishment Clause jurisprudence where the Supreme Court has disapproved of unequal treatment of religious activities measured against secular ones. See Kir-yas Joel Village, 512 U.S. at 704, 114 S.Ct. 2481 (stating that “civil power must be exercised in a manner neutral to religion”); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952) (<HOLDING>). This bar to unequal treatment is, of course,&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding jury is sole judge of witness credibility and may believe some witnesses and refuse to believe others&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that no meaningful distinction exists between those who leave their native country and those who already outside decline to return&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that government may not prefer those who believe in no religion over those who do believe&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed it&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding jury as judge of credibility may believe all some or none of the testimony&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:97,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;97&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;was unavailable in the state court.” Id. at 72. HSBC also cites several cases where federal courts have applied res judicata in this context. However, in each of these cases the state court upheld a dismissal of the plaintiffs claim. See, e.g., Day, 656 F.Supp.2d 331; Kremer, 456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262. Because the respective state courts granted the plaintiffs no relief, there could be no issue as to the ability of the state court to grant full relief; they are, accordingly, immaterial. 2. Subject Matter Jurisdiction HSBC argues that this Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over an action for attorney’s fees only. Section 2000e — 5(f)(3), the statutory provision granting subject matter jurisdiction to federal district courts over actions bro h Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>), Lewis v. Ames Dept. Stores, Inc., No. 3:97&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that because plaintiff no longer has available administrative remedies his action must be dismissed with prejudice&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;recognizing that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to bringing a  1983 action&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that state court judgment affirming an administrative decision did not bar a subsequent federal action for additional relief because of national policy that title vii remedies be available to supplement state remedies for employment discrimination&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that if adequate administrative remedies are available it is improper to seek relief in court before those remedies are exhausted&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that federal law governs remedies available under title ix&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:98,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;98&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;both husband and wife conceded that there was no goodwill to be had and that they simply did not think that the business was worth valuing as a going concern. Nevertheless, at the end of trial, the court assigned $10,000 of goodwill to the trucking business. The trial court issued its opinion letter in March 2000 assigning a goodwill value to the business and issued its judgment in August 2000. Between that time, husband did not object to the trial court’s assignment of goodwill. It is this lack of objection that leads wife to conclude that husband did not preserve his argument. We agree with wife that husband did not properly preserve his objection to the trial court’s decision on goodwill. See McDougal v. Griffith, 156 Or App 83, 86-87, 964 P2d 1135 (1998), rev den, 328 Or 330 (1999) (<HOLDING>). However, we may reach this issue under the&quot;},&quot;holding_0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that the failure to object at trial customarily means that a party has not preserved the claim on appeal&quot;},&quot;holding_1&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for review&quot;},&quot;holding_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a plaintiff who did not object to the trial courts memorandum opinion giving defendants more on their counterclaim than they had requested had not preserved that issue for appeal&quot;},&quot;holding_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appeal&quot;},&quot;holding_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it  &quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;example_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:99,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;99&quot;},&quot;citing_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). However, the non-moving party may not rest on its pleadings, but bears the burden to \&quot;make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to [the] case, based on the affidavits or by depositions and admissions on file.” See Harter v. GAF Corp., 967 F.2d 846, 852 (3d Cir. 1992). 6 . The court presumes that plaintiffs’ civil rights claims arise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, although the complaint does not specifically say so. The civil rights claims appear to be based on allegations of false arrest and malicious prosecution; thus, the court treats these claims as allegations of a violation of Gatter's rights under the Fourth Amendment. See Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271-74, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (<HOLDING>); Hilfirty v.

When the district court reviewed the evidence through the lens of an unlawful seizure, it was then-and only then-the court found Loos’s and Escobar’s consents were constitutionally deficient. The district court properly considered the legal effect of the officer’s lie about the drug dog alerting when pondering whether Loos and Escobar voluntarily consented to the searches of their luggage. The Supreme Court has “stated that even when of 86, 1191 (8th Cir.1992) (&lt;HOLDING>). Realizing there is “a vast difference between</span></div></div>

Because of the large number of ESPCs granted and the GAO report’s lack of specificity, the report did not contain sufficient information to enable the government to pursue an investigation against Honeywell. Accordingly, the GAO report was not a “public disclosure” under § 3730(e)(4)(A). See United States v. Alcan Elec. and Eng’g, Inc., 197 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.1999) (&lt;HOLDING>).

HSBC also cites several cases where federal courts have applied res judicata in this context. However, in each of these cases the state court upheld a dismissal of the plaintiffs claim.

Between that time, husband did not object to the trial court’s assignment of goodwill. It is this lack of objection that leads wife to conclude that husband did not preserve his argument. We agree with wife that husband did not properly preserve his objection to the trial court’s decision on goodwill. See McDougal v.
