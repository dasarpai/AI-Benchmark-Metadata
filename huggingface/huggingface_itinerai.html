During our trip to Florida, we were looking for activities for the kids. We purchased our tickets online, and the park was not as crowded, which was ideal for our visit. We attempted to rent a bicycle to ride around the park, but they were all booked for the entire two hours. We chose to take the tram ride around the Zoo. The ride lasted 45-50 minutes, with the conductor explaining each animal that passed by. The ride took us behind the park for the first 5 minutes, so there wasn't much to see. It was a pleasant experience for the children, and it beats walking. Other activities that can be done while walking through the water park and feeding the giraffes include viewing the animals in an enclosed rock dome. There is an activity area in an enclosed building at the zoo's entrance that was a fun experience for the kids with virtual butterflies, a maze, and other activities., Thank you so much for your recommendation and review., Written , June 3, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.&quot;,&quot;Great Zoo that's still getting better, It's been 17 years since my last visit to Zoo Miami and my how things have changed (and improved) here since then.  This has always been a large, well run zoo but it was even better with this latest visit.  Price for admission is about on par with other zoos this size, though seniors do get a 25% off reduction.  It can be a bit of a challenge to get here, especially on days when the traffic is heavy.  But, it's worth the trip.\n\nUsually, large zoos such as this one have zoo maps and sometimes animal footprints painted on the pathways so you know where you are going.  This zoo does not have either, so it helps to print the zoo map from their website before you visit.  Basically, Zoo Miami is broken down into three major pathways, with each route taking roughly two hours to cover on foot.  As you enter, the flamingo exhibit is very nice and allows you get very close to these amazing birds.  Just past this on the right is the exhibit for the Sumatran Tiger, another must see item.  You can then go left, straight, or to the right into the various world zones, but be sure to cover all three thoroughly.\n\nOur favorite exhibits included the jaguar exhibit which contains a cave that you can enter to see this magnificent cat up close if you are lucky.  The two female African elephants are both 47 years old and put on their own little show if you time your visit when the trainer is feeding them.  We also loved the Lowland Gorilla exhibit with it's two powerful silverback males, the painted wild dogs from Africa are a must see, and the precocious pygmy hippopotamus is quite entertaining and even used her water fountain jet by the pool as a personal bidet!  Finally, the collection of adult and juvenile giraffes is equally impressive, and allows visitors to climb up a ramp onto a platform and feed them.\n\nZoo Miami offers a fair amount of shade, but on hot days you may want to take several breaks because there is a fair amount of walking here, or catch the tram if you prefer.  COVID has shut down the zoo's monorail system, which hopefully will be operational again some day soon.\n\nThere are plenty of places to grab refreshments both near the entrance and on the various paths, and a nice gift shop can wrap your visit before exiting.  \n\nSuggestions for improvement would include re-introducing zoo maps when you pay for admission, color-themed painted animal tracks to better separate the zone you are in (similar to other large zoos like the Metro Toronto Zoo), and re-establishing the monorail system  now that COVID is winding down.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful zoo and easily ranks among the top three that we have ever visited.  It comes highly recommended., Thanks for the recommendation! Hope to see you soon., Written , March 11, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.&quot;,&quot;Nice day at the zoo, Visited the 2nd Friday in December.  The zoo was conveniently located off the turnpike and it wasn't crowded during our visit.  We bought our tickets and decided we would walk the zoo instead of renting their safari bikes which cost $54 for a small cycle and $69 for a large cycle. The zoo also offers tram rides lasting 45 minutes and cost $7 for non-members and $6 for members.  A sign said they discontinued the monorail last year because it was cost prohibitive for the zoo and it was getting difficult to get replacement parts for it.   We did a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes if you go and decide to walk.  \n\nDuring our visit, we saw countless animals from multiple continents and there was a sign there that illustrated the times they were feeding some of the animals as well as zoo keepers giving speeches on various animals in their care.  It was a mostly cloudy day and wasn't that hot, so the animals seemed a little more active than normal.

During our trip to Florida, we were looking for activities for the kids. We purchased our tickets online, and the park was not as crowded, which was ideal for our visit. We attempted to rent a bicycle to ride around the park, but they were all booked for the entire two hours. We chose to take the tram ride around the Zoo. The ride lasted 45-50 minutes, with the conductor explaining each animal that passed by. The ride took us behind the park for the first 5 minutes, so there wasn't much to see. It was a pleasant experience for the children, and it beats walking. Other activities that can be done while walking through the water park and feeding the giraffes include viewing the animals in an enclosed rock dome. There is an activity area in an enclosed building at the zoo's entrance that was a fun experience for the kids with virtual butterflies, a maze, and other activities., Thank you so much for your recommendation and review., Written , June 3, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Great Zoo that's still getting better, It's been 17 years since my last visit to Zoo Miami and my how things have changed (and improved) here since then.  This has always been a large, well run zoo but it was even better with this latest visit.  Price for admission is about on par with other zoos this size, though seniors do get a 25% off reduction.  It can be a bit of a challenge to get here, especially on days when the traffic is heavy.  But, it's worth the trip.\\n\\nUsually, large zoos such as this one have zoo maps and sometimes animal footprints painted on the pathways so you know where you are going.  This zoo does not have either, so it helps to print the zoo map from their website before you visit.  Basically, Zoo Miami is broken down into three major pathways, with each route taking roughly two hours to cover on foot.  As you enter, the flamingo exhibit is very nice and allows you get very close to these amazing birds.  Just past this on the right is the exhibit for the Sumatran Tiger, another must see item.  You can then go left, straight, or to the right into the various world zones, but be sure to cover all three thoroughly.\\n\\nOur favorite exhibits included the jaguar exhibit which contains a cave that you can enter to see this magnificent cat up close if you are lucky.  The two female African elephants are both 47 years old and put on their own little show if you time your visit when the trainer is feeding them.  We also loved the Lowland Gorilla exhibit with it's two powerful silverback males, the painted wild dogs from Africa are a must see, and the precocious pygmy hippopotamus is quite entertaining and even used her water fountain jet by the pool as a personal bidet!  Finally, the collection of adult and juvenile giraffes is equally impressive, and allows visitors to climb up a ramp onto a platform and feed them.\\n\\nZoo Miami offers a fair amount of shade, but on hot days you may want to take several breaks because there is a fair amount of walking here, or catch the tram if you prefer.  COVID has shut down the zoo's monorail system, which hopefully will be operational again some day soon.\\n\\nThere are plenty of places to grab refreshments both near the entrance and on the various paths, and a nice gift shop can wrap your visit before exiting.  \\n\\nSuggestions for improvement would include re-introducing zoo maps when you pay for admission, color-themed painted animal tracks to better separate the zone you are in (similar to other large zoos like the Metro Toronto Zoo), and re-establishing the monorail system  now that COVID is winding down.\\n\\nOverall, this is a wonderful zoo and easily ranks among the top three that we have ever visited.  It comes highly recommended., Thanks for the recommendation! Hope to see you soon., Written , March 11, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Nice day at the zoo, Visited the 2nd Friday in December.  The zoo was conveniently located off the turnpike and it wasn't crowded during our visit.  We bought our tickets and decided we would walk the zoo instead of renting their safari bikes which cost $54 for a small cycle and $69 for a large cycle. The zoo also offers tram rides lasting 45 minutes and cost $7 for non-members and $6 for members.  A sign said they discontinued the monorail last year because it was cost prohibitive for the zoo and it was getting difficult to get replacement parts for it.   We did a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes if you go and decide to walk.  \\n\\nDuring our visit, we saw countless animals from multiple continents and there was a sign there that illustrated the times they were feeding some of the animals as well as zoo keepers giving speeches on various animals in their care.  It was a mostly cloudy day and wasn't that hot, so the animals seemed a little more active than normal.  Throughout the zoo, the most popular animals were all the iguanas running around as well as dozens of squirrels seeking snacks from visitors.\\n\\nThere were several places throughout the zoo where you could buy refreshments or a snack, etc.  The zoo was larger than we expected and we spent about 4 1/2 hours walking around and taking photos from 1 animal exhibit to another before visiting the gift shop and leaving., Thank you so much for your recommendation and review.

We carry more than 40 exotic species at our facility with many available for interactive activities involving our guests. The five acre zoo houses everything from domestic animals and primates to large predatory birds and mammals. Some of our popular selection of exotic zoo animals are Chimpanzees, Gibbon Apes, Sloths, Lemurs, Owls, Snakes, Anteater, Lions Cub,, Tiger Cubs, Ligers, Black Jaguar, and mischievous Capuchin monkeys - like those used in many movies. The Zoological Wildlife Foundation offers intimate tours and private encounters by appointment. Contact us to schedule a special tour with our exotic animals! It's an experience you will never forget!\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;DESTINATION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miami&quot;},&quot;RATING&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;},&quot;REVIEWS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;Up close and personal with wild life, We paid for a one hour tour and spent almost a full two hours learning about and engaging with the animals. Our guide was great. She had worked there about 3 years and was knowledgeable about all of the animals and their unique stories and personalities. At the end of the tour, you get to hold baby alligators, blue younger skinks, boas and pythons and pet an owl. We also paid for additional time with a monkey and a baby kangaroo. They were worth every penny. It’s a once in a lifetime engagement. The pictures we got especially with the monkey were priceless. I would highly recommend this private zoo experience. I would also recommend going in the evening when the animals are more active., Traveled with family&quot;,&quot;Unforgettable Experience, My family had a wonderful experience at ZWF. I have to give props to our tour guide; she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the animals. I would truly like to thank her again for her positive vibes and for how patient she was with us and the other guests that were also present during the tour part of our day. I cannot imagine there is a better guide. There was about 10 people present for the tour and she asked at each stop if everyone got a chance to interact with the animals. She kept things moving but was able to observe us and slowed down when it was clear the group needed an extra moment to snap pictures with a critter or pass a few more snacks to the animals. I could tell she really loved the animals. The animals appeared to be well cared for, even the animals that were not so exotic like the field with the chickens and cows seemed well maintained. We also did the feline encounter after the tour. We were happy to have the same guide who did our tour sit with us during the encounters. It was worth the money for my family which included my 11 year old stepson. He got multiple chances to interact with each animal during the tour. He loved seeing the animals up close and since the guide was so nice he was very comfortable getting out of his comfort zone while feeding the monkeys and even petting a boa at one point.  We got to spend time playing with a serval kitten and a lion cub. We had plenty of time to take pictures and play with the babies. It seemed like we got about 10-15 minutes with each one. To me this was reasonable, and both animals seemed happy, healthy, and had a lot of personality. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the serval kitten and lion cub, she seemed to have a lot of experience taking good care of them. I would come back next time we are in Florida.&quot;,&quot;Amazing - I will do it again, An incredible experience for anyone who loves animals. I came to Miami from Boston specifically to visit the zoological wildlife foundation, and it was worth it. I purchased the special wildlife experience for myself (old man) and two young adults (18 and 24). All of us agreed the highlights were getting to touch and interact with wild cats (a baby Jaguar named Jasper sat in my lap and played with a toy),  lemurs, and gibbons - although all of the animals (too numerous to list) were great as well. Even in cases where you can’t actually touch the animals (adult lions and tigers) you are still getting a much closer look than you do at a traditional zoo.\n\nThe staff are helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Our guide was great, her passion for animals was obvious, and she was very knowledgeable. One really cool aspect, that you definitely don’t get at a traditional zoo, is the intimacy of the experience. The park only offers guided experiences, so it is not crowded, you feel like you are getting a very special private tour (you are!). I couldn’t tell you how many other visitors were there, but it couldn’t have been more than a handful. The staff coordinate to make you feel like you have the place to yourself. Our tour lasted about three hours, it was the perfect amount, and we never felt rushed from one interaction to the next. Although the description says you only get ~5 minutes with the animals, there was no clock watching by the guide, the interactions with animals never felt hurried.\n\nA few thoughts on how to make your  visit the best possible.\n1. You are interacting with wild animals, not house cats, if you act like a spaz and spook them that is your fault - if you startle the big cat cubs and they get scared there really isn’t much your guide can do in the time that you have to calm the animal back down. I doubt that most young children have maturity to not spook the animals and I personally wouldn’t recommend this park for large families or young (under 12) kids. This an incredibly intimate encounter with wild animals, and requires the guests to be calm and deliberate for maximum enjoyment.\n\n2. We went early in the day, and the weather was nice (mid 70s). I imagine that in the middle of the summer the animals might not be quite as active.\n\n3. This facility is not a traditional zoo, don’t expect costumed mascots or ‘artificial’ scenery. The facility is clean and in good condition, but you are visiting these animals in their homes, functionality takes priority over aesthetics.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;Up close and personal with wild life, We paid for a one hour tour and spent almost a full two hours learning about and engaging with the animals.

Like most tourist traps we visited on the trip we took from May 24th to July 3rd, this one was no exception.  We were about to go to the visitors center, when a tour group entered, with only two people wearing masks.  This lack of caution was typical everywhere we went.  If it was too crowded, as in this particular case, we refrained from \&quot;joining the crowd.\&quot;  Even though the virus was \&quot;lying low\&quot; during this particular time, just as I anticipated, later in the year, it raised its ugly head again. \nAs for Little Havana, it was interesting, in spite of being a little disappointed for not getting any souvenirs at the visitors center.  The \&quot;vibe\&quot; was nice.  We were parked across the street from the visitors center, at about 9 a.m.  At the time, someone was sweeping around the outdoor seating of the restaurant next to us.  Salsa music was playing, so we started dancing, salsa of course!  He offered to take our picture, so of course I took him up on the offer, and we have a unique souvenir of us dancing in front of the \&quot;Welcome to Little Havana\&quot; sign on the building behind us.\nAlso, someone was doing a photo shoot of four beautiful young ladies in music video style outfits in front of the restaurant.  (Yeah, I took some photos too!  It's a public location and I have a wedding quality camera.)\nOne of the highlights of this place, is all of the rooster statues one sees everywhere.  Great photo ops.  Even the Goodwill store, further down the road, has artwork on the sides of the building and their own rooster.  \nIf you visit Miami, you might want to stop in Little Havana.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;A Bit of Fun and Culture, We decided to do this on a not too warm of a day in Miami (rare occurrence) and to kill some time.

Like most tourist traps we visited on the trip we took from May 24th to July 3rd, this one was no exception.  We were about to go to the visitors center, when a tour group entered, with only two people wearing masks.  This lack of caution was typical everywhere we went.  If it was too crowded, as in this particular case, we refrained from \\\&quot;joining the crowd.\\\&quot;  Even though the virus was \\\&quot;lying low\\\&quot; during this particular time, just as I anticipated, later in the year, it raised its ugly head again. \\nAs for Little Havana, it was interesting, in spite of being a little disappointed for not getting any souvenirs at the visitors center.  The \\\&quot;vibe\\\&quot; was nice.  We were parked across the street from the visitors center, at about 9 a.m.  At the time, someone was sweeping around the outdoor seating of the restaurant next to us.  Salsa music was playing, so we started dancing, salsa of course!  He offered to take our picture, so of course I took him up on the offer, and we have a unique souvenir of us dancing in front of the \\\&quot;Welcome to Little Havana\\\&quot; sign on the building behind us.\\nAlso, someone was doing a photo shoot of four beautiful young ladies in music video style outfits in front of the restaurant.  (Yeah, I took some photos too!  It's a public location and I have a wedding quality camera.)\\nOne of the highlights of this place, is all of the rooster statues one sees everywhere.  Great photo ops.  Even the Goodwill store, further down the road, has artwork on the sides of the building and their own rooster.  \\nIf you visit Miami, you might want to stop in Little Havana.\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;PICTURE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;NAME&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Little Havana&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34438-d107606-Reviews-Little_Havana-Miami_Florida.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;categories\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Parks\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;description\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;DESTINATION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miami&quot;},&quot;RATING&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;REVIEWS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;Exceptionally well maintained park with excellent views, This park is huge and very clean and even at night we felt quite safe as it was lit very well.

The CFA opened to the public in 1984 as a partnership between Metropolitan Dade County Government and the Center for the Fine Arts Association Inc., a private 501(c) (3) corporation. In 1994, on the occasion of its tenth anniversary, the CFA's leadership determined to transform this County department from a space solely for temporary exhibitions into a private institution with a permanent collection dedicated to international art of the 20th and 21st centuries that reflected Greater Miami's diverse community and pivotal geographic location at the crossroads of the Americas.\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;DESTINATION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miami&quot;},&quot;RATING&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;REVIEWS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;Must experience Liminal Spaces, PAMM to me, has alway sbeen about the quality of whatever special exhibit is on view as the permenant collection to me feels a little thin, notwithstanding the captions written by wanna be literary art critics reaching for meaning when often then isn't much.

Once you’ve had the monkeys dancing at your feet and crawling over your shoulders you’ll start to wish you could experience this joy every day of your life.  The guides are informative and friendly and the grounds of the Monkey Jungle are clean and well maintained.  The true treat of the experience comes when you are privileged to feed the squirrel monkeys directly.  They squeak and they dance as they descend from the trees to your location at feeding time.  Some of them just grab the treats and run while others hang out and take company with you but the swarm of monkey’s does not stop during the entire feeding time.  Some love the peanuts others the fruits as they sit effortlessly on your small plate and chirp with glee at the treats.  Its hard to express what a positive and rewarding experience it is to see these marvelous creatures up close as they climb over and around and on top of you.

The staff were very friendly and answered any questions we had but I was a bit disappointed. Because Monkeys can contract covide they are only offering private tours which are $150 per person. I understood that we would get a tour of the rainforest to see Squirrel, Capuchin  and Howler Monkeys. We only got to see the Squirrel and Macaques Monkeys and the tortoises. I thought that they would let us see the other ones in their cages but after you visit the swimming pool, you feed the tortoises and then go into the forest which don't get me wrong was great but I would have really loved to see all the other Monkeys instead you are taken straight out of th park. Overall I didn't feel like the experience was really worth $150 but can say the people that work there are just awesome, very friendly and you can tell they love all the animals there so that alone is priceless but do think they should include a park tour as well.

I do agree that it is unique and nice having a small group so we had time to ask questions. However, we were sad to not be able to just be left to wander around the grounds and enjoy ourselves without the other people's children come running over to the monkeys we were playing with. We were able to feed the huge tortoise and that was fun, but again, we were in a group of around 18 people and had to wait our turn for some families to have their smaller children push in front of us and take a very long turn. One family was late in arriving so our tour did not start on time and we were not given the extra time at the end of our set time frame, staff were leaving the facility as we were being shown the way out, which we felt was not fair to us as we paid for a full hour of time that we did not get. The staff were very well informed and their love of the animals really showed, it was not just a job for them to be there.

One of my favorite part is the outside which can enjoy the amazing relaxing view of the bay, if you lucky can find manatee in the water., Traveled with family&quot;,&quot;Transport Yourself to 1920s Florida, We had a great time touring the grounds and buildings within the Estate and learning about Charles Deering and family whose brother actually built Viscaya just north of it closer to Miami.\n\nThe grounds, although not the Vizcaya manicured gardens are beautiful.   The different buildings are reflective of life in the are in the early 1900's.   The highlights for sure are the Stone House and the Richmond Cottage because of it's history dating to the days before Deering purchased the land.\n\nThe Boat Basin is unique and a haven for manatees.  It was so fun to see a good number of them breaching for air and enjoying their natural habitat.   However, I was concerned for them as we witnessed a tour boat that appeared to be part of Miami-Dade Parks called the MDPros Explorer come into the basin with their full blasting engines to drop off a group of people.  It is my understanding that boats with such engines are to at least lower their speed and or raise their engines none of which happened.   We mentioned it to the skipper as people were getting off the boat and he didn't seem to care which was concerning given the fact manatees are protected and in danger species. \n\nOverall, a great visit and a very interesting place., Thank you for your review. , Written , February 20, 2021, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.&quot;,&quot;Lovely stop, This is a great stop - staff was very helpful (alerted us to possible manatee sighting in the tidal basin, which turned out to be true!). Unlike Vizcaya up the road (the estate of the other Deering brother), on a weekday we could wander here without any crowding. Do go upstairs in the house - the bedrooms and baths are very authentic to the time, and many items owned by the family are still onsite (or have been returned to the house).  Gardens aren't as extensive as Vizcaya, and mangrove boardwalk was still broken when we visited.  Do walk to the Chinese bridge about a mile from the house.  All in all, a lovely stop with very nice and helpful people. One constructive suggestion - the explanatory postings on the art could be more helpful about dates and sources of the work.  , Thank you for your review! Jan - April are generally good times to see manatees in the basin, we are glad you were able to see them during your visit. , Written , March 1, 2020, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;Amazing afternoon, Beautiful estate to enjoy with family.

One of my favorite part is the outside which can enjoy the amazing relaxing view of the bay, if you lucky can find manatee in the water., Traveled with family\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Transport Yourself to 1920s Florida, We had a great time touring the grounds and buildings within the Estate and learning about Charles Deering and family whose brother actually built Viscaya just north of it closer to Miami.\\n\\nThe grounds, although not the Vizcaya manicured gardens are beautiful.   The different buildings are reflective of life in the are in the early 1900's.   The highlights for sure are the Stone House and the Richmond Cottage because of it's history dating to the days before Deering purchased the land.\\n\\nThe Boat Basin is unique and a haven for manatees.  It was so fun to see a good number of them breaching for air and enjoying their natural habitat.   However, I was concerned for them as we witnessed a tour boat that appeared to be part of Miami-Dade Parks called the MDPros Explorer come into the basin with their full blasting engines to drop off a group of people.  It is my understanding that boats with such engines are to at least lower their speed and or raise their engines none of which happened.   We mentioned it to the skipper as people were getting off the boat and he didn't seem to care which was concerning given the fact manatees are protected and in danger species. \\n\\nOverall, a great visit and a very interesting place., Thank you for your review. , Written , February 20, 2021, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Lovely stop, This is a great stop - staff was very helpful (alerted us to possible manatee sighting in the tidal basin, which turned out to be true!). Unlike Vizcaya up the road (the estate of the other Deering brother), on a weekday we could wander here without any crowding. Do go upstairs in the house - the bedrooms and baths are very authentic to the time, and many items owned by the family are still onsite (or have been returned to the house).  Gardens aren't as extensive as Vizcaya, and mangrove boardwalk was still broken when we visited.  Do walk to the Chinese bridge about a mile from the house.  All in all, a lovely stop with very nice and helpful people. One constructive suggestion - the explanatory postings on the art could be more helpful about dates and sources of the work.  , Thank you for your review! Jan - April are generally good times to see manatees in the basin, we are glad you were able to see them during your visit. , Written , March 1, 2020, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;PICTURE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/5e/62/df/deering-estate-at-cutler.jpg?w=500&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1,&quot;width&quot;:1},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:true},&quot;NAME&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Deering Estate&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34438-d298695-Reviews-Deering_Estate-Miami_Florida.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;categories\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Shopping Malls\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;Three levels of shops and restaurants form downtown's \\\&quot;city-within-a-city,\\\&quot; Brickell City Centre, which is flanked by a flagship Saks Fifth Avenue and trendy eateries like Tacology.\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;DESTINATION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miami&quot;},&quot;RATING&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;},&quot;REVIEWS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;Safe and plenty to do, This area of Miami is what you likely picture when you think of Miami:  Lambos and Rolls, glass buildings, high-end shopping, eclectic restaurants and of course the nightlife.

It is discrimination because 2 guys traveled together., Traveled as a couple&quot;,&quot;Cruise Ship Capital, I always enjoy finding a historical marker so I can learn a little more about the history of an area. The Port Miami historic marker is located in front of Bayside and at the entrance to the port, at the intersection of Biscayne Boulevard U.S. 1 and Port Boulevard. Marker F-818 was erected in 2014 by Florida East Coast Industries, Florida East Coast Railway, Foreign Affairs Center, Inc., Florida Trade Association and the Florida Department of State.\n\nAfter reading the marker I learned that the history of Port Miami goes back to 1895 when local land owners Julia Tuttle and and William and Mary Brickell convinced Henry Flagler to bring the railroad to Miami. The area was unincorporated and had only 300 residents when the first passenger train arrived in 1896. The original Port of Miami was where Maurice Ferré Park now sits. After making a channel, Flagler began offering passenger service between Miami and Key West in 1897. Flagler also owned a steamship company, Peninsular and Occidental (P&amp;O) which provided shipping service between Miami, Grenada, and Nassau. In the early 1900s, Government Cut was dredged along with a new channel to what is now called Bicentennial Park in downtown Miami. This new access to the mainland created the Main Channel which greatly improved the shipping access to the new port.\n\nAfter World War II Port Miami experienced a boom due to its proximity to the Caribbean and South America.  A port expansion resolution was adopted by the city of Miami on April 6, 1960. The port was moved to Dodge Island which was created from three historic islands Dodge, Lummus and Sam's Islands which were combined into one. The port was formally named Dante B. Fascell, in honor of 19-term Florida Congressman Dante Fascell, Port of Miami is also now known as the \&quot;Cruise Capital of the World\&quot; and \&quot;Cargo Gateway of the Americas.\&quot; The port is connected to Downtown Miami by Port Boulevard, a causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway and to the Watson Island via the Port Miami Tunnel. It is the largest passenger port in the world and one of the largest cargo ports in the United States. Over 5.5 million people a year pass through the port as they board such cruise lines as Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Disney, and MSC. The port provides hundreds of thousands of jo\\bs and it positively impacts Florida's economy by providing over 40 billion dollars each year.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;Well organized port, We disembarked from our cruise and found the lines moved quickly and efficiently in the terminal.

It is discrimination because 2 guys traveled together., Traveled as a couple\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Cruise Ship Capital, I always enjoy finding a historical marker so I can learn a little more about the history of an area. The Port Miami historic marker is located in front of Bayside and at the entrance to the port, at the intersection of Biscayne Boulevard U.S. 1 and Port Boulevard. Marker F-818 was erected in 2014 by Florida East Coast Industries, Florida East Coast Railway, Foreign Affairs Center, Inc., Florida Trade Association and the Florida Department of State.\\n\\nAfter reading the marker I learned that the history of Port Miami goes back to 1895 when local land owners Julia Tuttle and and William and Mary Brickell convinced Henry Flagler to bring the railroad to Miami. The area was unincorporated and had only 300 residents when the first passenger train arrived in 1896. The original Port of Miami was where Maurice Ferré Park now sits. After making a channel, Flagler began offering passenger service between Miami and Key West in 1897. Flagler also owned a steamship company, Peninsular and Occidental (P&amp;O) which provided shipping service between Miami, Grenada, and Nassau. In the early 1900s, Government Cut was dredged along with a new channel to what is now called Bicentennial Park in downtown Miami. This new access to the mainland created the Main Channel which greatly improved the shipping access to the new port.\\n\\nAfter World War II Port Miami experienced a boom due to its proximity to the Caribbean and South America.  A port expansion resolution was adopted by the city of Miami on April 6, 1960. The port was moved to Dodge Island which was created from three historic islands Dodge, Lummus and Sam's Islands which were combined into one. The port was formally named Dante B. Fascell, in honor of 19-term Florida Congressman Dante Fascell, Port of Miami is also now known as the \\\&quot;Cruise Capital of the World\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;Cargo Gateway of the Americas.\\\&quot; The port is connected to Downtown Miami by Port Boulevard, a causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway and to the Watson Island via the Port Miami Tunnel. It is the largest passenger port in the world and one of the largest cargo ports in the United States. Over 5.5 million people a year pass through the port as they board such cruise lines as Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Disney, and MSC. The port provides hundreds of thousands of jo\\\\bs and it positively impacts Florida's economy by providing over 40 billion dollars each year.\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;PICTURE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/7c/d8/28/port-of-miami.jpg?w=500&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1,&quot;width&quot;:1},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:true},&quot;NAME&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Port of Miami&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34438-d10037103-Reviews-Port_of_Miami-Miami_Florida.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;categories\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Theaters\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;The Olympia Theater opened in 1926 as downtown Miami's grandest silent movie palace and Vaudeville house.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, The Kampong's living collections include such tropical fruits as pomelo, 23 cultivars of avocado and 65 varieties of mango, palms, flowering trees, ficus, aroids and bamboo. In addition to the living collections, The Kampong also has living quarters for researchers, teachers and scientists, as well as meeting facilities for larger groups. The site also is well configured for weddings and outdoor events.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Very Photogenic!, I had a delightful time at The Kampong.  I decided to bring my grandmother for the 11:30 self-guided tour and we adored it. A beautiful and relaxing residence, the Kampong is a perfect location for leisurely walks, dates, photography and I'm even thinking about throwing my wedding there when I get married in the future; they have a gorgeous, spacious event space. I fell in love  with the asian style decor and the oolite limestone columns ( which, was my favorite part of the entire building). \\n\\nAnd, of course, how large of a selection they had of plants and trees. a very well kept garden, the trails are fairly easy to follow and the majority of plants/trees have name tags. \\n\\nMy favorite tree was the banyan at the entrance. A tree with rich history, this one is perfect for photos, and of course... just getting lost in. \\n\\nCherry on top: My aunt's car battery died during her tour, and the staff were very eager to assist. \\n\\nThank you Kampong Gardens :)\&quot;,\n  \&quot;A nature hidden gem!, You'll love The Kampong if you enjoyed visiting the Miami Tropical Fairchild Garden. This garden is more curated and have a beautiful varieties of tropical fruits that are introduced to the United States from Asia. They have different types of mangoes, pineapples, avocados, pomegranates... Just make sure to buy your tickets online before showing up.

If you’re in the area chances are you’ve been walking under the sun, even if for a little while. And although there are several watering holes in the area -even with a lot of construction going on, I bet few, if any, are as refreshing, satisfying, and invigorating as Veza Sur Brewing Co; especially if you’re a beer lover. This place boasts a wide range of home-brewed beers, including seasonal ones and beer-based cocktails, which are beyond refreshing. Just having so many options from where to choose, makes a beer enthusiast happy!!! If you’re new to this place have a sampler and decide what beer you’re going for, don’t forget to listen to your server’s advice!!! And though you might not be here for the food, bites are agreeable, tasty, well portioned, and reasonably priced.

If you don't do the tour you might not be that excited about your visit. \n\nOther fees - I think there is another fee to enter the state park of maybe $2 or so but we had an annual state parks pass.\n\nThe park is where one of the pioneers of Coconut Grove lived and we really enjoyed the guided tour which is the only way to see the house.\n\nThere are a lot of comfortable chairs on the porch and over the property to sit and relax and enjoy the view as well.&quot;,&quot;Hidden Gem, The Barnacle is a true hidden locals gem in Coconut Grove, FL.

Over the years it has been so fun to visit the Rubell Collection when it was in Wynwood and now Allapattah.  Like the Medicis, the Rubells, and other collectors and making their own museums, raising up local and international artists and just out-running traditional museums since they are not beholden to anyone. \n\nWe visited and loved the spaces, loved the Kusama silver balls flooding the central hallway, loved the room full of Purvis Youngs, the Mauricio Cattelan self-portrait sculpture, the Kehinde Wiley, I could go on!  \n\nMy only complaint is that charging extra for small Kusama Infinity Rooms seems a little silly.  They are cool, we've stood in them but they are not $40 cool.  Make them free and let people just queue up to enjoy them.  Rubells have enough money and so does Kusama, nickle and diming for a peek is just a little tacky.&quot;,&quot;Contemporary art gallery is second to none, One of the largest and far reaching private collections of contemporary art we have visited notable for its geographic diversity. The breadth of artists is amazing. The Rubells were early patrons of Jeff Koons, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Their continuing artist in residence continues to spotlight emerging artists. Cannot say enough good things about this expertly curated collection and it’s display. A very satisfying, informative and thought provoking experience. It was the largest collection of Keith Herring I ever expect to see in my life. Amazing paintings of twins and cowboys by Ghanaian Otis Kwame Kye Quaicoe the 2021 Artist in Residence. Swede Cajsa von Zeipel creates these acrylic sculptures that are grotesque and seductive all at once. Too much to describe. Not to mention there were 2 Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room installations there at the time of our visit. Sadly that was a temporary exhibit that is over. They were what initially attracted us to go but the entire collection is strong enough to stand on its own without them., Traveled as a couple&quot;,&quot;Must see in Wynwood, Love this museum. It is a perfect size with enough collections to make you feel like it was worth the money (15 per person) but not so big that you are overwhelmed. You can do the whole gallery in 1-1.5 hours. Artists like Basquiat and Hirst, as well as newer contemporary artists.

It is a perfect size with enough collections to make you feel like it was worth the money (15 per person) but not so big that you are overwhelmed. You can do the whole gallery in 1-1.5 hours. Artists like Basquiat and Hirst, as well as newer contemporary artists. Great representation of many perspectives.\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;PICTURE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/e3/3b/ce/photo1jpg.jpg?w=500&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1,&quot;width&quot;:1},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:true},&quot;NAME&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Rubell Museum&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34438-d9703218-Reviews-Rubell_Museum-Miami_Florida.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;categories\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Art Galleries\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;Cubaocho is for most the best place for live music in Miami.

The digital art on the walls you could sort of interact with.  For instance, if you touched a flower on the wall, it would then die.  It did not work for me, but it worked for others I saw! The other room was really cool too! I wish they only let in a certain amount of people at a time because it would’ve been cooler if there were less people in the room for better videos.  The two best parts of this museum were the cloud room and the mirror room. The cloud room was so cool! It was like you were walking around amongst the clouds! And if your friend does not go in with you they can see you on the outside by some windows.  The mirror room was awesome as well you were surrounded by mirrors mirrors and mirrors! Great for photos and videos! I even ran into some corners which was cool.  Lol!  One experience I totally did not get at all. It was like you were staring at a big wall of light. I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. And everyone’s just staring at it for a whole minute. I was like “what are we looking at?”  Another downside, and I hate to say it, but it was the people that worked there. I would try to make a joke with them, and they were all just very negative, very not happy people. I thought at first it was just the guy that was at the desk that charged us admission, but then the next guy we ran into in the first room giving directions was the same way as well as the girl that I talked to to buy my ticket for the cloud room.  I wanted to say if you don’t like your job leave.  But I don’t know if they actually get paid or are volunteers.    Maybe it’s a toxic environment to work in. I don’t know. But that’s the only reason I gave this a four instead of a five…BUT I do highly recommend going to this museum if you’re in town. It was a really cool experience!  Just don’t talk to the people that work there much🤣., Traveled with friends&quot;,&quot;Immersive and expensive, Admission was $43 per person, once you go through the exhibit you can’t go back again. We spent an hour here. \n\nBasically there were three immersive experiences.  First we saw two rooms with floor to ceiling seasonal changes. We saw buds come from the ground, bloom with colorful flowers all around us, watch the leaves blow and the seasons change. There were mirrors on the walls and the floor which kept moving. I thought this was very cool and loved being immersed in the art.\n\nWe then put on booties, passed 3 holograms and were given instructions before going into a room where the color of light continuously changed. What was interesting about this exhibit was we couldn’t see the end of the room there were no boundaries the white walls meshed with the corners ceiling and floor. It was creative.\n\nThe third exhibit was a wow.  We started with a short film and then the door /screen opened up and we were in a maze of mirrors. We looked up and down and they were mirrors &amp; reflections everywhere.  There was a water feature and we stood on the side of the water and saw a reflection in the mirrors.  \n\nWe ended in a small, limited, very expensive gift shop. There was valet parking for $15 but we parked on the street at a meter., Traveled as a couple&quot;,&quot;OK for adult, overpriced for a toddler, I had just been to San Francisco's teamLab's exhibit at the Asian Art Museum called Continuity and loved it so much that I decided to check out Superblue.\n\nIt was just ok, especially because I went with my 4 year old and it was too abstract (and too expensive) for him. teamLab was very exciting for him (even though Miami's wasn't interactive the way SF's was) and the last room seemed like we had landed in Planet Krypton so we had fun in that maze.\n\nThe adult price felt ok but it is overpriced at $35 for a a child under 12 who couldn't quite evoke emotions out of him.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;Super blue, This art exhibit was really cool!

The museum is deeply committed to providing open, public access to artistic excellence by offering year-round free admission.\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;DESTINATION&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miami&quot;},&quot;RATING&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;REVIEWS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;Glad I went, I don't usually like modern art, but, did enjoy the collection on exhibit here when I came in June.

They have many enclosed cases filled with models and other memorabilia.

The museum is located on an Airport. It is  located at Kendall-Tamiami Airport in Miami-Dade County. You can just drive into the airport and the museum is clearly sign posted. There was plenty of parking outside the museum building. We entered through the gift shop and paid $20 for 2 adults( kids were $6 and pensioners were $7). The place opens from 10am to 5pm Wed- Sat and Sunday 12pm to 5pm. It is closed on Monday and Tuesdays.\n\nAfter we had paid we went into a door that took us into a museum. There were lot's about the 2nd world war and military stuff and tents and history about the war. Pilots helmets and an engine cut in half which you could actually see working. We then went into another huge hanger where all the planes were kept. Going back a few years , a pilot called Kermit Weeks had an Aviation Museum here but as his collection grew and grew he needed more space and moved everything away. People in the area missed the museum so some people decided to open their own up. \n\nFour military and classic plane enthusiasts got together and decided to change the existing hanger into “Wings Over Miami Air Museum”. The museum’s new  founders were  Walter Orth, Larry Ploucha, Vincent Tirado and Tom Righetti and they  dreamed of a flying museum. They worked with Kermit Weeks who helped them get everything together. \n\nWe went into the large hanger and saw loads of classic and military planes that had been beautifully restored. There were some men working on some of the planes and we spoke to some of them. One man said that the helmet in the museum near the entrance was actually his. Most of the planes are still flown and are taken out now and then. There were jet planes and older propeller planes and a few newer modern planes. Such as a  1945 North American SNJ-6 and a 1968 Aero L29-R Delfin Jet and a 1995 Yakovlev Yak 52. All the planes were so clean and shiny they looked new. Clearly the people who have restored these planes loved doing so. There were bout 15 planes inside the hanger and 1 large plane outdoors. Each plane had a description of what it was and what it could do etc. Height, speed etc. People were about so you could ask any questions too. \n\nWe then went outdoors and looked at the large black plane. It was a seaplane which needed restoring. We spent about 1 hour and 15 minutes looking round the museum and really enjoyed it. Thought the entrance fee was sensible. As you exit you go back through the gift shop which has rest rooms which we used. When we were at the museum we were the only visitors there which was quite a surprise. Maybe because it was January and most people had gone back to work. I am glad I went here as it was very interesting. As we were leaving we saw the men pulling a plane outdoors that they were going to fly that day. I think this place is more for adults as kids may get abit bored after a while. If you are into flying and planes and the history of planes you will love it all. I am not that into it but I really enjoyed it( hubby is more into planes etc than me). Well worth going to .

You pay for the ambience. Very nice outdoor seating for social distancing. WARNING regarding the parking: The parking located adjacent to the Ironside property is run by a company called Professional Parking Management. Feel free to look them up. Parking is payable via the PayByPhone app which is fine, BUT if you are over by any amount of time these guys will politely mail you a ticket with photos and time stamps just like the traffic cameras for a traffic violation but it will be an expired parking session. Make sure you plan for at least 30 minutes more than you expect via the PayByPhone app to make sure you don't get a bill for 85.00 a few days after your visit.

You pay for the ambience. Very nice outdoor seating for social distancing. WARNING regarding the parking: The parking located adjacent to the Ironside property is run by a company called Professional Parking Management. Feel free to look them up. Parking is payable via the PayByPhone app which is fine, BUT if you are over by any amount of time these guys will politely mail you a ticket with photos and time stamps just like the traffic cameras for a traffic violation but it will be an expired parking session. Make sure you plan for at least 30 minutes more than you expect via the PayByPhone app to make sure you don't get a bill for 85.00 a few days after your visit.

  "The Hearst Castle of the East, When I first saw Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami, Florida, even before I began my tour of the extraordinary 70-room villa and estate built by businessman James Deering of the Deering McCormick International Harvester fortune, it reminded me of American circus mogul John Ringling's Ca' d'zan in Sarasota, Florida. Located on Biscayne Bay in the present day neighborhood of Coconut Grove, the 50-acre complex was constructed between 1914 and 1923 at a cost of $15 million. It includes the villa, extensive Italian Renaissance gardens, native woodland landscape and historic village outbuildings. The villa contains rooms of distinctive architectural interiors decorated with numerous antiques, with an emphasis on 15th through early 19th century European decorative art and furnishings. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, the villa was used by Deering as his winter residence from 1916 until his death in 1925. Because of the villa's exterior and garden architecture that was a composite of different Italian Renaissance villas and gardens, Vizcaya has often been described as the \"Hearst Castle of the East,\" a reference to William Randolph Hearst's San Simeon in California. It features Gilded Age technology, including doorbells, a dumbwaiter and the first telephone system in Miami-Dade County. In the swimming pool grotto, visitors can see one of only two public places in the world to feature a surviving mural by prominent American artist Robert Winthrop Chandler.",
  "Worth a visit, The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens are worth a visit. The museum is fascinating. We appreciated that there is information about the people who worked there before it was a museum and the impact of climate changes. \n\nIt was nice to stroll through the gardens. February is probably not the best time to see them. They are likely much more impressive in the spring and summer.\n\nWater views are beautiful.\n\nParking is easy. \n\nStaff in museum and cafe are very responsive and welcoming. \n\nP.S. According to the website and signage upon arrival, you have to buy tickets on-line. Unfortunately, this is clunky on a mobile phone and personal information is requested to \"register\" that is not really necessary. You can just walk up to the ticket counter and buy tickets.",
  "Absolutely  Amazing, What a lovely place full of history and great architecture. We really did not expect such old European architecture in the USA. It's a beautiful place to learn about the history of the Deering Estate and relax and enjoy the garden. As of now, you can only purchase tickets online so please ensure you do so before visiting especially if you do not have a data plan. It's only when I got there I realise that I needed to book online, luckily I had a data plan and was able to book.\n\nAn audio tour comes with the purchase so download the Vizcaya app befoe and ensure you walk with headsets.\n\nFor those wondering how to get there, you can take the Train from downtown Miami and stop at the Vizcaya station. From here you can walk just ask someone for directions."

  "description": "At Wynwood Walls, you can view over 35 hand-sprayed murals and visit two street art galleries. Wonder at works by household names of the graffiti scene like Os Gemeos and many others, and take as many pictures as you like. Don't forget to pop by the gift shop for cool souvenirs afterward. The museum is located in the heart of Miami's Wynwood Art District, which is famous for its world-class street art but also boasts numerous art galleries and attractions like the Original Selfie Museum.\n\nJoining a street art tour is a great way to see all of the area's its hidden gems.\n\n– Tripadvisor"

  "Spray paint the walls!, This place is super fun and in a great area to hang out and explore prior or after your art experience at wynwood walls. The prices are around 10-12$ for an adult ticket but kids are cheaper and STUDENTS PAY 5$. So don’t forget to bring ur student ID. We spent over an hour there looking at all the art on walls outside and there are little rooms inside  to show case some art work in a more immersive setting. MOST FUN PART was spray painting the walls. I will leave a picture of that down here. Overall, def recommend and the gift shop is loaded with awesome items and souvenirs to take home for yourself or a friend., Traveled with friends",
  "Awesome display of street art and more, The Wynwood  site is so much bigger that our last visit 5 years ago with tons more art and improvements including a Welcome Center, upgraded seating, refreshments and astro-turf in certain areas because of large number of visitors.  Well worth the $10 admission for a senior that we bought on site mid-week shortly after they opened at 10am.  The displays are some of the best graphic, graffiti and street artists in the world and are vibrant with color with fascinating designs. Easy access off I-95 and parking on street is $3.25/hour 1 block away with the PaybyPhoneApp.   We spent about 2 hours taking tons of pics with cameras and cellphones.  The surrounding neighborhood has additional art.  Seeing art outside (and inside) is a special treat.  Great for a date or family visit and certainly lots of selfies.",
  "Wow! What an amazing place!, My wife and I booked tickets for Wynwood Walls, and I unknowingly booked tickets with a tour. I couldn’t have been happier of my error. It was supposed to be a group tour but turned out it was only my wife and me. We had Glayson as our guide and are so thankful for his time and knowledge. We learned far more through him than we would have with a self-guided tour. He also shared more about the overall art scene in Miami. We’ll definitely be visiting Wynwood Walls again and would highly recommend paying a little extra for a guided tour. Well worth it!, Traveled as a couple"

  "Great Atmosphere/Vibe, In a day early for a cruise so what better way than walk across the street from the Holiday Inn and spend the afternoon/evening walking the complex and taking in all the beautiful scenery. It was extra festive being St. Patrick's Day, with festivities on the water, bars buzzing with March Madness and the 82 degrees and sunshine. We spent a nice long afternoon at the Landshark Bar &amp; Grill that we loved with their basketball specials. In the evening the place lights up and the Miami skyline around Bayside was fantastic and cruise ships are visible a short distance away at the port. Overall, there were hundreds of shops and restaurants, but the only negative was the limited breakfast options there the next morning. The only real sit down breakfast place wanted $28 for pancakes and $7 for juice. Not going to happen. They need to put something realistic for breakfast in here and if not please put a Wendy's in here for a good fast food breakfast under $10.",
  "great way to spend a day, we arrived in Miami from the airport at 9 am too early to check-in at the hotel. There was 4 of us. So we went to bayside marketplace. they had shops street vendors sightseeing water activities it's a great way to spend free time we walked the shops stopped for lunch at landshark restaurant we had peel and eat shrimp i would say they were the large size and they were chilled with cocktail sauce and fried pickles they were the bomb. we had fish tacos it was 3 to a order the seafood combo that wasn't a large serving for the money, bbq burger was ok, and the crispy chicken sandwich and key lime pie for dessert we spent $102. for the 4 of us excluding the tip. then we went for a boat ride to south beach and the cost was $35. per person it was about a 20-30 minute ride the boat lets you off and comes back in a hour but the thing is where the drop you off its more of a boat dock no sandy beach all in all the day was over at 4:30 and we had a good day.",
  "I may go back in maybe 5 or 6 years, I have not been at Bayside maybe for 4 or 5 years or more. The place is just fine, it is going through a renovation, and some stores are closed, as it is part of the top floor on one area. It is still a nice place to go for a couple of hours.  I was not aware that the big Ferris Wheel there does not open until 1 or 2 PM. In general it is a place to relax and have a nice time until you have to pay for parking, because most of the scanners are not reading the bar code for the parking ticket, and not having an actual person handling this creates a big delay for some drivers, like it happened to me yesterday because my ticket was not read and I had a line of cars after mine honking until at last I was able to pay. By the way, I think it is cheaper taking Uber to go to Bayside. I paid $30 for about 3 hours or less that I was there"

  "Very Nice Outing for the family!, My children had a great time at the Miami Zoo. During our trip to Florida, we were looking for activities for the kids. We purchased our tickets online, and the park was not as crowded, which was ideal for our visit. We attempted to rent a bicycle to ride around the park, but they were all booked for the entire two hours. We chose to take the tram ride around the Zoo. The ride lasted 45-50 minutes, with the conductor explaining each animal that passed by. The ride took us behind the park for the first 5 minutes, so there wasn't much to see. It was a pleasant experience for the children, and it beats walking. Other activities that can be done while walking through the water park and feeding the giraffes include viewing the animals in an enclosed rock dome. There is an activity area in an enclosed building at the zoo's entrance that was a fun experience for the kids with virtual butterflies, a maze, and other activities., Thank you so much for your recommendation and review., Written , June 3, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.",
  "Great Zoo that's still getting better, It's been 17 years since my last visit to Zoo Miami and my how things have changed (and improved) here since then.  This has always been a large, well run zoo but it was even better with this latest visit.  Price for admission is about on par with other zoos this size, though seniors do get a 25% off reduction.  It can be a bit of a challenge to get here, especially on days when the traffic is heavy.  But, it's worth the trip.\n\nUsually, large zoos such as this one have zoo maps and sometimes animal footprints painted on the pathways so you know where you are going.  This zoo does not have either, so it helps to print the zoo map from their website before you visit.  Basically, Zoo Miami is broken down into three major pathways, with each route taking roughly two hours to cover on foot.  As you enter, the flamingo exhibit is very nice and allows you get very close to these amazing birds.  Just past this on the right is the exhibit for the Sumatran Tiger, another must see item.  You can then go left, straight, or to the right into the various world zones, but be sure to cover all three thoroughly.\n\nOur favorite exhibits included the jaguar exhibit which contains a cave that you can enter to see this magnificent cat up close if you are lucky.  The two female African elephants are both 47 years old and put on their own little show if you time your visit when the trainer is feeding them.  We also loved the Lowland Gorilla exhibit with it's two powerful silverback males, the painted wild dogs from Africa are a must see, and the precocious pygmy hippopotamus is quite entertaining and even used her water fountain jet by the pool as a personal bidet!  Finally, the collection of adult and juvenile giraffes is equally impressive, and allows visitors to climb up a ramp onto a platform and feed them.\n\nZoo Miami offers a fair amount of shade, but on hot days you may want to take several breaks because there is a fair amount of walking here, or catch the tram if you prefer.  COVID has shut down the zoo's monorail system, which hopefully will be operational again some day soon.\n\nThere are plenty of places to grab refreshments both near the entrance and on the various paths, and a nice gift shop can wrap your visit before exiting.  \n\nSuggestions for improvement would include re-introducing zoo maps when you pay for admission, color-themed painted animal tracks to better separate the zone you are in (similar to other large zoos like the Metro Toronto Zoo), and re-establishing the monorail system  now that COVID is winding down.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful zoo and easily ranks among the top three that we have ever visited.  It comes highly recommended., Thanks for the recommendation! Hope to see you soon., Written , March 11, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.",
  "Nice day at the zoo, Visited the 2nd Friday in December.  The zoo was conveniently located off the turnpike and it wasn't crowded during our visit.  We bought our tickets and decided we would walk the zoo instead of renting their safari bikes which cost $54 for a small cycle and $69 for a large cycle. The zoo also offers tram rides lasting 45 minutes and cost $7 for non-members and $6 for members.  A sign said they discontinued the monorail last year because it was cost prohibitive for the zoo and it was getting difficult to get replacement parts for it.   We did a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes if you go and decide to walk.  \n\nDuring our visit, we saw countless animals from multiple continents and there was a sign there that illustrated the times they were feeding some of the animals as well as zoo keepers giving speeches on various animals in their care.  It was a mostly cloudy day and wasn't that hot, so the animals seemed a little more active than normal.  Throughout the zoo, the most popular animals were all the iguanas running around as well as dozens of squirrels seeking snacks from visitors.\n\nThere were several places throughout the zoo where you could buy refreshments or a snack, etc.  The zoo was larger than we expected and we spent about 4 1/2 hours walking around and taking photos from 1 animal exhibit to another before visiting the gift shop and leaving., Thank you so much for your recommendation and review. We’re so happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit. We would like to encourage you to please share your experience on Yelp to help spread the word. Hope to see you at Zoo Miami again soon!, Written , January 4, 2023, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

  "Bang for your Bucks!, The shopping was fabulous. It was something for everyone. The value was awesome. My neice had a ball shopping and buying everything she wanted. Dresses in some stores were $3.00, she bought a two piece bathing suit for $5.00, and the list goes on.

  "Day at the mall., With only one day at the mall and less hours on a Sunday, I had to make every minute count. Yes, I was on a mission. To check as many outlets as I possible could and find the right bargains and sales. \nWhen visiting the mall, its mandatory that you wear your most comfortable sneakers/footwear. You are going to be walking a lot. Don't forget the fitbit on your wrist. ;)\nIt is also advised to plan ahead before your visit if you are a tourist. Go to the mall website and download the map so you can know where the stores you want to go are located and can plan accordingly and maximize on time., Jesse R, reviews like this give us motivation and help us ensure we provide high-quality care., Written , February 27, 2020, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.",
  "More storage space would be nice, Spent a very pleasant day here and got plenty of bargains.  As with most malls, quietest time is first thing in the morning.  After doing some shopping, we went to put our shopping in the lockers but found that all the lockers were gone.  So more needed.  If you are planning a spree, I’d get locker first thing, so it is available when you need it later in the day. It is a daily rate price. \nWe were visiting from South Beach, and found the Uber fare (25 dollars) and time to travel to the mall (30 minutes) to be very reasonable. , Amwhelehan, thanks for visiting! We just added more lockers. We now have them by The Cheesecake Factory, next to the Food Court and by the bathrooms near Victoria's Secret. Next time you visit, please pass by the Information Booth so one of our representatives can help you find everything you need.

  "Up close and personal with wild life, We paid for a one hour tour and spent almost a full two hours learning about and engaging with the animals. Our guide was great. She had worked there about 3 years and was knowledgeable about all of the animals and their unique stories and personalities. At the end of the tour, you get to hold baby alligators, blue younger skinks, boas and pythons and pet an owl. We also paid for additional time with a monkey and a baby kangaroo. They were worth every penny. It’s a once in a lifetime engagement. The pictures we got especially with the monkey were priceless. I would highly recommend this private zoo experience. I would also recommend going in the evening when the animals are more active., Traveled with family",
  "Unforgettable Experience, My family had a wonderful experience at ZWF. I have to give props to our tour guide; she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the animals. I would truly like to thank her again for her positive vibes and for how patient she was with us and the other guests that were also present during the tour part of our day. I cannot imagine there is a better guide. There was about 10 people present for the tour and she asked at each stop if everyone got a chance to interact with the animals. She kept things moving but was able to observe us and slowed down when it was clear the group needed an extra moment to snap pictures with a critter or pass a few more snacks to the animals. I could tell she really loved the animals. The animals appeared to be well cared for, even the animals that were not so exotic like the field with the chickens and cows seemed well maintained. We also did the feline encounter after the tour. We were happy to have the same guide who did our tour sit with us during the encounters. It was worth the money for my family which included my 11 year old stepson. He got multiple chances to interact with each animal during the tour. He loved seeing the animals up close and since the guide was so nice he was very comfortable getting out of his comfort zone while feeding the monkeys and even petting a boa at one point.  We got to spend time playing with a serval kitten and a lion cub. We had plenty of time to take pictures and play with the babies. It seemed like we got about 10-15 minutes with each one. To me this was reasonable, and both animals seemed happy, healthy, and had a lot of personality. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the serval kitten and lion cub, she seemed to have a lot of experience taking good care of them. I would come back next time we are in Florida.",
  "Amazing - I will do it again, An incredible experience for anyone who loves animals. I came to Miami from Boston specifically to visit the zoological wildlife foundation, and it was worth it. I purchased the special wildlife experience for myself (old man) and two young adults (18 and 24). All of us agreed the highlights were getting to touch and interact with wild cats (a baby Jaguar named Jasper sat in my lap and played with a toy),  lemurs, and gibbons - although all of the animals (too numerous to list) were great as well. Even in cases where you can’t actually touch the animals (adult lions and tigers) you are still getting a much closer look than you do at a traditional zoo.\n\nThe staff are helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Our guide was great, her passion for animals was obvious, and she was very knowledgeable. One really cool aspect, that you definitely don’t get at a traditional zoo, is the intimacy of the experience. The park only offers guided experiences, so it is not crowded, you feel like you are getting a very special private tour (you are!). I couldn’t tell you how many other visitors were there, but it couldn’t have been more than a handful. The staff coordinate to make you feel like you have the place to yourself. Our tour lasted about three hours, it was the perfect amount, and we never felt rushed from one interaction to the next. Although the description says you only get ~5 minutes with the animals, there was no clock watching by the guide, the interactions with animals never felt hurried.\n\nA few thoughts on how to make your  visit the best possible.\n1. You are interacting with wild animals, not house cats, if you act like a spaz and spook them that is your fault - if you startle the big cat cubs and they get scared there really isn’t much your guide can do in the time that you have to calm the animal back down. I doubt that most young children have maturity to not spook the animals and I personally wouldn’t recommend this park for large families or young (under 12) kids. This an incredibly intimate encounter with wild animals, and requires the guests to be calm and deliberate for maximum enjoyment.\n\n2. We went early in the day, and the weather was nice (mid 70s). I imagine that in the middle of the summer the animals might not be quite as active.\n\n3. This facility is not a traditional zoo, don’t expect costumed mascots or ‘artificial’ scenery. The facility is clean and in good condition, but you are visiting these animals in their homes, functionality takes priority over aesthetics."

  "Heat!, A good place to watch basketball and Miami Heat prelims. \n\nHere you can find everything you need to have a good time and purchase Heat accessories.\n\nThe traffic arrangements can be quite congested, so you should be prepared for that. It is worth finding out about bus route changes and bus stop changes.",
  "Good experience, Being disabled is not an easy thing especially around a huge crowd, I was very impressed how accommodating it was for me on this particular occasion. Crew seemed very organize trying to get ppl in through parking &amp; security, however, process was a bit slow but it could also be due to the massive crowd. Arriving there early is highly recommend., Traveled with friends",
  "First park, then enjoy, The Miami Heat are having a tremendous season, so is nice to visit the American Airlines Arena, home of the Heat, to feel the hot. But the first is to have a good parking, just to go in just to left. They are expensive in the way how far it is. So if you are early you can’t take a 15 or 20 buck parking, walk a little big,  but when finish you can leave easy. The stadium is easy to go especially if you have your ticket by internet. They are not cheap. But if you want to enjoy you better pay a good ticket, or probably can enjoy special saloon, like Bacardi, but in deep I can’t tell you about. Probably the game will be full house, so try to get ticket in first or second deck, in the third; you probably will enjoy the game in the screen and is not funny.  Is a real spectacle, enjoy."

  "We like to use City public transport, It was so easy to take the Metromover to our Downtown hotel.  The people working on the platform were helpful when I first purchased the ticket from the ticket machine.  The ride was enjoyable and we didn't have to worry about traffic.  I'll always use this service when I come to Miami.",
  "Amazing things happen in a metro mover, I like taking the metro mover to go around Brickell and Bayside. Last time my little boy and I took the metro mover was amazing! I guy got into the metro mover and stared taking to my son. It was a fun conversation that everyone was enjoying. The guy decided to sit down on the floor and the laughing continues with the conversation then suddenly on the next stop a security guy jump into the metro mover and asked the guy to stand up. The guy did so but he started to complain and in less than 1 minute the conversation between those two got into a big argument. My son turned around and asked me...What is going on Mom? They are actors I reply! \nThis is a show for all the persons in this metro mover. Everybody was paying attention to the discussion those two were having. I decided to exit in the next stop and wait for the next metro mover. My son was excited and told me let’s see if we get another show in the next metro mover. 😅, Traveled with family",
  "A great and free transport system, A great FREE transportation system in downtown Miami. It is basically a driver-less elevated monorail that loops around downtown with stations a couple of blocks apart. There are three loops and connects with the Metrorail stations at Brickell and Government Center. Very convenient and excellent for tourists to get nice views of downtown., Traveled solo"

  "Great fun, each gun brought a smile to our faces, This place is great!  I'm an avid gun fan and my dad is not (but doesn't dislike them), and we both had so much fun.\n\nShooting firearms from all over the world was so cool, and the instructors were all very helpful and knowledgeable.  Our instructor was Chris, who broke down each gun in pretty great detail to show the pros and cons of each gun, and made us both very confident in shooting!  We shot a pretty big variety of guns, like the big SAW machine gun, the .50 caliber Barrett, SCAR, Vectors, and more.  \n\nThe P90 was probably one of my favorite firearms to shoot, though once you start holding the trigger and the guns start really shooting they're all a blast.\n\nPrices are available in a bundle or 'a la carte' where you can build your bundle of 3+ guns how you want.  Expect to drop some money, guns can be individually rented for around 70 to 100 dollars for 25 rounds.  It's honestly worth it however, and I would definitely recommend going with a friend/family as getting to watch them shoot is almost as much fun as shooting yourself.  Thanks for the great time!, Traveled with friends",
  "The best part of my US trip by far, I recommend lock and load Miami to anyone who might be even mildly interested in guns. They have packages for all ages. Even my little brother (13) got to shoot some amazing fully automatic 9 mm guns. Our instructor Will taught us all about gun safety and the history behind each firearm. In the lobby there is a museum where I can hold a bunch of prop guns and take some amazing pictures. Lock and load Miami is no joke one of the coolest places I’ve ever been and I will definitely go there again someday., Traveled with family",
  "A don’t miss experience (get it?), Max was really great at making us comfortable and handling a newbie and a semi-experienced shooter.  Very calm and great to load all of the weapons.  Front desk person (Veronica) was very patient and helpful.  It’s not cheap, but neither is running an operation like this and you can shoot guns that only the special forces have access to.  Loved the .50 cal and the silencer.  Highly recommend, we actually came in once and went to the museum for free and regretted not shooting - now that’s rectified.  Goes to show you a patient customer experience pays off!, Traveled as a couple"

  "Eclectic neighborhood known for graffiti, Eclectic area with focus on graffiti- therefore outdoor free spaces to explore.  I would recommend true exploration during daytime hours as the area encompasses a ghetto with many closed down stores and dark alleys.  My small group of 3 adults felt safe the entire time but we were aware of where we were when it became dark.  The area had a variety of food options and the. Wynwood Walls “museum” was worth the visit.  A hidden gem of Miami. We stayed in an air bnb and had access to everything we needed without transportation.

  "Graffiti at its Best!, We were here in Florida three years ago and toured the area. The graffiti in that area is phenomenal. World class.  However many of the older murals on the walls are painted over with new paintings which was both exciting and sad. The quality of the works is amazing. Much of it should belong in a museum. Well worth your time to visit and view all the works of art in the neighborhood.\n\nWhat is surprising is that many new buildings are being built in the area and taking away some of the old charm.\n\nParking is an issue and it has become an expense which three years ago,  you could park anywhere for free.\n\nI would still recommend going. It’s worth your time., Traveled as a couple",
  "Eclectic, This artsy neighbourhood is known for its bold evocative art on building facades, walls and the like. Sometimes the messages on these hand painted murals are a little obtuse and even dark, but the skill and talent is undeniable. The art is found on several city blocks and is considered the highest concentration of street art anywhere in the world. Within this area is an outdoor museum Wynwood Walls that has many contemporary artists exhibited. There is also a Wynwood Walk that takes people on walking tours and explains what they are seeing. Nowadays, this area has become very trendy with many fashionable shops, galleries and eateries locating here., Traveled as a couple"

The vision for a rejuvenated Design District was codified in an urban master plan developed by the award-winning master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk, with the additional participation of architects including Walter Chatham, Hariri and Hariri, Juan Lezcano, Terence Riley, and Alison Spear. The Miami Design District embodies a singular dedication to the unity of design, fashion, art and architecture, and a commitment to encourage a neighborhood comprised of creative experiences."

  "Art, Fashion and Shopping, I came here mostly to see some unique pieces of art which happened to be scattered throughout the area.  They ran the gamut of building designs, stand alone art pieces,  rooftop and inside stores or building lobbies.  I had to rush since I did not put enough time on the parking meter.\n\nHigh fashion and expensive stores also were found here in between art works, galleries and restaurants.\n\nIt was a nice place to walk around but also popular for photo shoots with two different modeling sessions going on., Traveled solo",
  "Design Inspiration, Along with Upper Buena Vista just north of it, the Miami Design District dates back to the 1890's when it was a small village, home to cracker's who migrated from Georgia and North Carolina to farm pineapples in Florida. Along with Lemon City and Little River, Upper Buena Vista and the Miami Design District are the oldest settlements in Miami. Many of the homes here date to Florida's land bloom years of the 1920's when the first subdivisions were built.\n\nTwenty years ago Miami native Craig Robins recognized the potential of this part of Miami and he started purchasing buildings in the neighborhood for the purpose of creating a place with exceptional architecture, design and experiences. L Catterton joined Robins as a partner in 2011 and encouraged luxury brands to move into the Design District. Today there are more than 120 flagship luxury stores in the district along with restaurants, public art, event spaces, museums, and galleries.\n\nThere are four parking garages in the design district. I \\have only used the Museum Garage and it is only $3 to park. There is also some limited street parking. I love to come here to nosh, window shop, take pictures, and see free art. It is also a pretty awesome place to people watch. If you are looking for something different to do in Miami, the Design District is full of fun surprises. You can subscribe to the Miami Design District newsletter on their website, follow them on Instagram,  or like them on Facebook to stay on top of all the happenings.",
  "Beautiful Architecture, We enjoyed walking around and looking at all the cool architecture and sculptures. In addition to high-end stores, there are lots of restaurants and bars. Even if you don't like shopping, it's worth just spending an hour or two walking around."

  "A Bit of Fun and Culture, We decided to do this on a not too warm of a day in Miami (rare occurrence) and to kill some time. Took an Uber from our hotel and it is a colorful little strip of walking with some cigar shops, ice cream stand, cafes, restaurants (busy), little shops, and such, but when you reach the end of the strip, it looks shady and dangerous. It was not too busy in the am to noon hour but right after lunch time, it got packed. I thought worth the visit for a little bit of fun and experiencing the culture, and food if you want to get a big Cuban sandwich, stuff like that. We ate at a restaurant that had a little band and the food was delicious but a tad bit expensive with small portions. I focused on an artist who was local versus trendy tourist shops for trinkets. We did get cigars too! I think it wasn't as big as I expected. Quick visit.",
  "A closer look into Cuban culture, We went to Little Havana early in the morning because we wanted to have a real Cuban breakfast and we were not disappointed. We went into a couple of restaurants and everything we tried was delicious. Another good thing was the prices! way cheaper than other parts of Miami. After breakfast we took a walk through the neighborhood, visited Domino Park and met interesting characters along the way. We also stepped into some shops and bought great cigars and souvenirs. There are many murals around the neighborhood representing many aspects of Cuba and its culture (great for pictures). Don't skip a tour to Little Havana if traveling to Miami!",
  "Fun place., If COVID-19 is still active when you visit, wear a mask!  Like most tourist traps we visited on the trip we took from May 24th to July 3rd, this one was no exception.  We were about to go to the visitors center, when a tour group entered, with only two people wearing masks.  This lack of caution was typical everywhere we went.  If it was too crowded, as in this particular case, we refrained from \"joining the crowd.\"  Even though the virus was \"lying low\" during this particular time, just as I anticipated, later in the year, it raised its ugly head again. \nAs for Little Havana, it was interesting, in spite of being a little disappointed for not getting any souvenirs at the visitors center.  The \"vibe\" was nice.  We were parked across the street from the visitors center, at about 9 a.m.  At the time, someone was sweeping around the outdoor seating of the restaurant next to us.  Salsa music was playing, so we started dancing, salsa of course!  He offered to take our picture, so of course I took him up on the offer, and we have a unique souvenir of us dancing in front of the \"Welcome to Little Havana\" sign on the building behind us.\nAlso, someone was doing a photo shoot of four beautiful young ladies in music video style outfits in front of the restaurant.  (Yeah, I took some photos too!  It's a public location and I have a wedding quality camera.)\nOne of the highlights of this place, is all of the rooster statues one sees everywhere.  Great photo ops.  Even the Goodwill store, further down the road, has artwork on the sides of the building and their own rooster.  \nIf you visit Miami, you might want to stop in Little Havana."

  "A real eye-opener in the heart of Overtown, Today, some students from my school were able to view the museum. It was a real eye opener for students and the chaperones. Most didn't know the museum existed and reading about racism is one thing. Looking at primary sources and artifacts is another. The displays and the information were on point. They went hand in hand. The tour guides asked guided questions that were very engaging. There were hands on activities that the students did as well. It was a wealth of knowledge and a great way for the students, or any spectator, to keep learning about Black History beyond the month of February. It's also about our very own local history. We enjoyed our visit and learned a lot. Thanks to Dade Heritage Trust for sponsoring it.",
  "FWC officers and students learn local history, Sgt Jackson gave a thorough tour of the museum to FWC Officers and their mentees (of Big Brothers Big Sisters).

  "Great holiday idea ⚾️, An enjoyable evening at Marlins Park. Accessible for both driving your own car or rideshare. WiFi in and around the  stadium makes it easy to organise pick ups.\nA modern stadium and staff were very helpful and friendly - esp Sarahlee. \nLots of choice for food and drink which is usually pricey but it was slightly more expensive than envisaged.\nThe game itself V Pittsburgh Pilates was exciting -\nYou do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy. It really is an evening out and a recommend experience. \nTickets were cheap around 15$ each including taxes and air conditioning was a huge plus 😂, Traveled as a couple",
  "A welcome place for an opposing fan!, My teen son and I are on a bit of a stadium tour. This happened to be the destination of our home team during our spring break. We caught two nights of baseball with the roof open. Parking nearby was very easy (we purchased in advance) and traffic direction around the stadium (and some construction) was handled well. In the ballpark, there are great food options and great views. A fun place to catch a game!",
  "Great experience!, Not a Marlins fan, but we decided to go to a game before flying home from a vacation in southern FL. The tickets were crazy cheap, so it was hard to pass up!\n\nThe stadium is beautiful, so it's a shame they don't get better attendance. Parking is probably the best I've experienced at a sports event - multiple parking garages that are literally right next to the stadium. No shuttles, no mile-long walks in huge crowds, no sketchy people trying to sell you stuff. Walk out of your car, down the steps, and into the stadium. Parking is affordable at around $15, and you pay by plate (instead of waiting in line to pay the attendant). Concessions are your standard overpriced ballpark options - good choices, but pricey. \n\nDefinitely recommend going to a game if you're in the Miami area."

  "Perfect way to travel in Miami for free, I used the trolley while on vacation in Miami and thought it was a great service! I travelled between the Design District and Wynwood as well as to Bayside, several times, notably on the 2013 and 2084, and the service was excellent, the drivers were friendly, and trolleys were clean with Covid-19 social distancing measures in place. There is an online trolley tracker so you can see when the next one is coming and where all the stops are so it's easy to use even though it doesn't run to a specific schedule. Thanks to the great drivers and I hope it can continue to be a free service!, Traveled as a couple",
  "Great way to explore Miami Beach for free, A brilliant free way to travel the length of Miami Beach. There are several options. The Collins Express, Northern loop, Middle loop and southern loop. Frequency is every 15-20 minutes though this is sometimes irregular. They were rarely busy.",
  "Great free way to get around, You can't complain much with a free ride around town. Their app could use some updates,  but it works decently enough to find stops and see the routes. It's unfortunate there isn't one that goes to South Beach and area, but we still used them frequently. , Traveled with family"

  "description": "Pérez Art Museum Miami is a modern and contemporary art museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting international art of the 20th and 21st centuries. Established in 1984, the Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) evolved from the Miami Art Museum, which grew out of the Center for the Fine Arts (CFA). The CFA opened to the public in 1984 as a partnership between Metropolitan Dade County Government and the Center for the Fine Arts Association Inc., a private 501(c) (3) corporation. In 1994, on the occasion of its tenth anniversary, the CFA's leadership determined to transform this County department from a space solely for temporary exhibitions into a private institution with a permanent collection dedicated to international art of the 20th and 21st centuries that reflected Greater Miami's diverse community and pivotal geographic location at the crossroads of the Americas."

  "Must experience Liminal Spaces, PAMM to me, has alway sbeen about the quality of whatever special exhibit is on view as the permenant collection to me feels a little thin, notwithstanding the captions written by wanna be literary art critics reaching for meaning when often then isn't much.  At the moment, both Liminal Spaces and Mariano are well wroth seeing.  Liminal in particular is a whimsical and fun display of interactive installations that in itself is worth the price of admission.  If you leave without smiling, you have no sense of wonderment.",
  "Awesome!, This was the best art museum I’ve ever been to and I’ve been to several. It’s pretty inexpensive considering it’s a museum. You do have to check your large bags upon entering which I’m not really a fan of. There’s plenty of museum security around to intervene should anything happen. A lot of the exhibits available when I went were multi dimensional or interactive. Not just paintings on a wall or even just sculptures. A lot of the artists used lights, technology, etc so it made me rethink art. Some used optical illusions. The gift shop is a little overpriced like most attractions. I was able to get some $1 postcards but $4-5 for a sticker is a bit much. I do wish they had a little better signage or flow. So you could know which exhibits you’d already seen. But again it was the best art museum I’ve been to., Traveled solo",
  "Loved our visit, LOVED our visit to this museum. A light filled, beautifully sited (right on the water) place. Reasonable admission costs for a museum (though we were just two \"seniors.\")\nSolid permanent collection and the special exhibition, Liminal Spaces, was engaging for all ages. \n\nNote: parking is $15 in the adjacent lot."

  "A Taste of Havana, Around Presidente Supermarket there was more locals but a couple blocks away the tourists wandered the sidewalks and crowded the restaurants and stores.\n\nMany painted rooster statues by artist Pedro Damian were located in various spots during the walk.  It came out of an initiative to celebrate the local culture.  There were also many different murals covering sides of buildings in parking lots.\n\nA Latin walk of fame graced a few blocks between 12th and 17th.  \n\nA local Dominos Park was busy with people hanging out or playing games.    \n\nThe Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center was a cool stop with Cuban history, cigars and rum.  \n\nThe Bay of Pigs Museum was offset by a block but closed.  \n\nEven the McDonald’s had its own Little Havana theme.\n\nStreet parking required either downloading an app or calling a 800 number, registering your car’s license plate and then paying the fee based on time chosen.  Side street parking were limited to residents with permits.\n\nI spent less than an hour here as I went to Versailles for my lunch., Traveled solo",
  "Immerse yourself in Cuban-American culture., I was always taught that to understand a culture you need to immerse yourself in it.\nThis street in Miami gives you a deep understanding of the Cuban American relationship and presents each visitor with a magic combination of sound, color, unique flavors and characters in every place you visit.\n\nExperience the relationship between music, dance, domino's, cigars and coffee and let yourself feel the heart and passion of a people longing for the old days where they had a free nation., Traveled as a couple",
  "The best way to see Latin Culture, Walking down Calle Ocho made me feel like I was transported to the Islands and/or Central/South America.  Tasty foods, fine art, jewelry and clothing await you. If you happen to visit Sundays (Salsero) or Mambo Monday, you are in for a lively dance experience.  Churromania@Little Havana had delicious, freshly made churros covered with a light sugar for a traditional taste., Traveled solo"

  "Fun place that needs repairs and updating, My grandkids, now 6 and 7, were here for their annual visit to the Children’s Museum. They like going to it, but every year we find a lot of things that arent working, which is disappointing. The instrument section is an example of this, including the big floor piano. Also, at the grocery store where kids can pretend to shop, the checkout registers barely work, which is frustrating for older kids. Employees anywhere in the exhibits are nonexistent, so you can’t ask anyone a question about how things work. (But we noticed that a lot appeared out of nowhere when our session ended. Maybe they were doing activities in the classrooms?) We attended a fun snowglobe-making session in one classroom, tho we thought we were there for igloo-making with marshmallows. That turned out to be on another floor, so we missed it. It just seems like this should be a better run place, but it never seems to improve. It’s definitely not for kids older than 10., Traveled with family",
  "My daughter loved it!, It isn't perfect, but my daughter had a blast.  Some elements were not working,  and the pricing is a little high, especially for a 19 mo.  However, there was something for kids of all ages. We loved the music wing, which was highly interactive. Many of the art activities come at an additional charge.  You can easily entertain a kid for hours, so pack accordingly.",
  "Day of fun, We have never been here. I've lived in the area for 6 years an have always wanted to go. My girls are 8 and 10. They had more fun running through each level and looking at each station , more than actually playing in them. They were amused by each area an thought it was cool but they only played in a few areas. We were done in 2 hours. If they were ages 5 to 7 or so , it prolly would've been more fun interaction for them. They had fun fishing , jumping on huge floor piano , the slide , and shopping in the small publix and making me suns at the little deli. They ran through most of it. Their favorite part was the rock climbing wall. They spent like 20 to 30 min there. There was no line. It was 4 dolars a kid. That was a good price I thought. It was fun an cute but I think mine would've had more fun at the science museum cuz of their age and their interest. After the 2hiurs of running through it and basically skimming by each room, they were ready to leave for chuckie e cheese. It was nice. I didnt think it was run down at all. I didnt think anything was unclean. It looked very well.kept up with. Nothing was broken that I noticed even though we didnt do too much interaction. But I thought it was really well done. I'm sure if you're from a huge city this may be small for you but this was our first time ever at a children's museum so I have nothing to compare it too. They had 2 different outdoor playgrounds. One is by the entrance and the other is only entered through the museum's door , inside the museum,  just for the other playground. , Traveled with family"

  "Coconut Grove, Excellent walkable area in Coconut Grove.  There is a CVS for knick knacks, excellent restaurants (try Glass  &amp; Vine, MrC and Amal, which is a high end Lebanese restaurant). I There is Starbucks, and small cafe types if you want to be budget conscious.  The only way to by pass the parking fees is to stay in an Airbnb that offers parking, otherwise you're spending down town NYC parking charges (or Uber).\n\nCoconut Grove is  12miles from South Beach but it might as well be 50 miles as it will take you 45 minutes to an hour to get there- But totally worth it.  The beach feels and looks like the Caribbean Riviera, with the water temperature  feeling like about 75 degrees.  I would recommend a separate day for South Beach unless you're on a tight time line and want to capture as much as you can.\n\nVisit the Barnacle Historic Park ($2), Vizcaya and Wynwood Wall if time permits.  The town has an upscale vibe and is well lit at nights- once you start traveling away from the restaurants and lights, the mood gets to be more urban .\n\nWalk along the bay and visit Monty's.  There is a free bus which takes you to Brickell - I didn't go, but found the free bus/trolley to take you there.",
  "Quaint Village, Awful Paking, Would come here more often except the parking situation is atrocious. I have no problem coming early in the morning for breakfast at Greenstreet Cafe but almost always hope “this time will be different” when attempting to come to Bombay Darbar for lunch, drive around for 5-10 minutes to never find street parking, and head to Coral Gables. \n\nThey do have antiquated parking garages with small spaces that do not account for today’s larger SUV’s, meaning my nice sports sedan is likely to get dinged....sorry, too many other neighborhoods to visit without the hassle as The Grove....for those who think the situation will get better when condo construction ends, what about all the residents and guests who will occupy and visit those new buildings??..no thanks., Traveled solo",
  "Excellent Hidden Gem, The entirely fortunate people who call this tiny pocket of the greater miami area home are the luckiest. It is a gem. I love the quiet intimacy and privacy of its commercial area, its almost bohemian atmosphere, and its artistic bent. It feels like a world away from the grit and swagger of muscular Miami. This is a quiet and refined version. Love it here. "

  "A rare, unique, intimate experience!, The experience at Monkey Jungle is not like any other I have ever had in the US.  Like others have stated, when you hear the high cost of entry, it may bring you pause and wonder if it will be worth it…. Once you’ve had the monkeys dancing at your feet and crawling over your shoulders you’ll start to wish you could experience this joy every day of your life.  The guides are informative and friendly and the grounds of the Monkey Jungle are clean and well maintained.  The true treat of the experience comes when you are privileged to feed the squirrel monkeys directly.  They squeak and they dance as they descend from the trees to your location at feeding time.  Some of them just grab the treats and run while others hang out and take company with you but the swarm of monkey’s does not stop during the entire feeding time.  Some love the peanuts others the fruits as they sit effortlessly on your small plate and chirp with glee at the treats.  Its hard to express what a positive and rewarding experience it is to see these marvelous creatures up close as they climb over and around and on top of you.  It was easy and fun to take monkey-selfies holding the food plate in one hand and the phone in the other.  I highly recommend this experience for all animal lovers and anyone looking for a unique and intimate experience with these tiny golden yellow and black marvels!, Traveled as a couple",
  "Worth the price?, My husband took me here for my birthday as I absolutely adore Monkeys. The staff were very friendly and answered any questions we had but I was a bit disappointed. Because Monkeys can contract covide they are only offering private tours which are $150 per person. I understood that we would get a tour of the rainforest to see Squirrel, Capuchin  and Howler Monkeys. We only got to see the Squirrel and Macaques Monkeys and the tortoises. I thought that they would let us see the other ones in their cages but after you visit the swimming pool, you feed the tortoises and then go into the forest which don't get me wrong was great but I would have really loved to see all the other Monkeys instead you are taken straight out of th park. Overall I didn't feel like the experience was really worth $150 but can say the people that work there are just awesome, very friendly and you can tell they love all the animals there so that alone is priceless but do think they should include a park tour as well. I hope covid goes away (I know wishful thinking) so we can go see all the Monkeys again.",
  "Awesome but short time, I absolutely loved taking my grandson here to experience very up close and personal time with all the cute monkeys. I do agree that it is unique and nice having a small group so we had time to ask questions. However, we were sad to not be able to just be left to wander around the grounds and enjoy ourselves without the other people's children come running over to the monkeys we were playing with. We were able to feed the huge tortoise and that was fun, but again, we were in a group of around 18 people and had to wait our turn for some families to have their smaller children push in front of us and take a very long turn. One family was late in arriving so our tour did not start on time and we were not given the extra time at the end of our set time frame, staff were leaving the facility as we were being shown the way out, which we felt was not fair to us as we paid for a full hour of time that we did not get. The staff were very well informed and their love of the animals really showed, it was not just a job for them to be there. One nice staff member took a few photos of me on my camera so that I had something to look back on so I was very appreciative of that kind gesture. Fun for all ages!"

  "Amazing afternoon, Beautiful estate to enjoy with family. Must paid fee to enter but enter get to enjoy the beautiful estate unbothered. The Main house has the beautiful view of the bay and artifacts inside the house, such dresses, lamps, window painting, bedroom etc. The other  house has the rocking chair which you can sit and enjoy the bay view, house also has artifacts and bedroom to see. One of my favorite part is the outside which can enjoy the amazing relaxing view of the bay, if you lucky can find manatee in the water., Traveled with family",
  "Transport Yourself to 1920s Florida, We had a great time touring the grounds and buildings within the Estate and learning about Charles Deering and family whose brother actually built Viscaya just north of it closer to Miami.\n\nThe grounds, although not the Vizcaya manicured gardens are beautiful.   The different buildings are reflective of life in the are in the early 1900's.   The highlights for sure are the Stone House and the Richmond Cottage because of it's history dating to the days before Deering purchased the land.\n\nThe Boat Basin is unique and a haven for manatees.  It was so fun to see a good number of them breaching for air and enjoying their natural habitat.   However, I was concerned for them as we witnessed a tour boat that appeared to be part of Miami-Dade Parks called the MDPros Explorer come into the basin with their full blasting engines to drop off a group of people.  It is my understanding that boats with such engines are to at least lower their speed and or raise their engines none of which happened.   We mentioned it to the skipper as people were getting off the boat and he didn't seem to care which was concerning given the fact manatees are protected and in danger species. \n\nOverall, a great visit and a very interesting place., Thank you for your review. , Written , February 20, 2021, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.",
  "Lovely stop, This is a great stop - staff was very helpful (alerted us to possible manatee sighting in the tidal basin, which turned out to be true!). Unlike Vizcaya up the road (the estate of the other Deering brother), on a weekday we could wander here without any crowding. Do go upstairs in the house - the bedrooms and baths are very authentic to the time, and many items owned by the family are still onsite (or have been returned to the house).  Gardens aren't as extensive as Vizcaya, and mangrove boardwalk was still broken when we visited.  Do walk to the Chinese bridge about a mile from the house.  All in all, a lovely stop with very nice and helpful people. One constructive suggestion - the explanatory postings on the art could be more helpful about dates and sources of the work.  , Thank you for your review! Jan - April are generally good times to see manatees in the basin, we are glad you were able to see them during your visit. , Written , March 1, 2020, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

  "Interesting but overpriced and badly needing renovation., Staff was nice. Shows with dolphins and sea lion were interesting, but the ticket was overpriced. Also, the site promises a $6 discount per person when buying online, but when you do, it charges the full price. The locale badly needs renovation. It looks as it were from the 60’s., Traveled with family",
  "Here is the deal with this place, Here’s the deal with this place. As everyone said, it is old. Some parts of the park almost feel like a ghost town. \n\nBUT there is cool stuff here for the right curious kids. The flamingos were terrific, you could almost touch them. The skates and rays and bamboo sharks were fun to touch. Some massive turtles you could look at. \n\nThe manatees were impressive — one 60+ years old and huge. \n\nAnd $40 is not cheap, but it’s not excessive for this type of place either. \n\nBut what this place is known for is the dolphin related stuff. \n\nI took my daughter (9) and we splurged and did the dolphin experience, about $100/person. I had done these before in the Caribbean — was her first time. \n\nIt was really great. Staffed really well, experts, passionate, and the experience was amazing, significantly better than ones I have done in the Caribbean. \n\nCome for the dolphins. That’s why you should come. \n\nAnd if it’s raining, a steady rain,. Don’t come. This is a mostly outside aquarium, it’s not one of the indoor types., Hello, we appreciate your positive feedback about your experience.

  "Great shows, The cost is a bit high. With discounts if you purchase tickets in advance lunch and parking it’s about $50.00. Per person.\nThe place is a bit dated and the aquarium exhibits could use an update.\nThe shows more than make up for any negatives.\nThey were all great and very entertaining.\nThe place is also an animal rescue center which increases their costs.\nWe need to support places like this and our animals do too which is why you need to go.\nI am glad I did .You need about 4 hours to see the shows and exhibit.\nIf you have kid and are visiting Miami go., Traveled with family"

  "Pretty Bad, I went to this museum on a rainy day with my dad. The museum is definitely FOR CHILDREN under 10 years old. This should have been advertised more because it definitely diminished our experience. The different experiences are pretty cool and I bet a kid would love it.\nI found a major problem with the cafe. Me and my dad waited 40 minutes for overpriced, cold, minimalistic food. There was nowhere to sit because of how busy it was and no-one wanted to help.\n\nI would NOT recommend for adult only parties. Fun for kids I suppose. Do not go in the Cafe. , Thank your for your visit! We aim to present our information for all ages and education levels as to provide a welcoming and educational experience for all visitors. We appreciate your feedback, and have shared it with our exhibition team. Thank you again for visiting, and we hope to welcome you and your dad again soon!, Written , April 24, 2023, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC., Traveled with family",
  "Great Indoor/Outdoor day ... pricy museum, For anyone with a free day in Miami, the Frost Museum is a great place to spend the morning or afternoon. I was a bit leary that it may be more of a children's attraction, but it is definitely a great day for all ages. The Frost Museum has both indoor and outdoor exhibits with elevators that take you to 1 of 4 levels with different themes on each; my husband and I visited in the heat of Miami summer (so as you can expect, we melted). \n\nBetween the 2nd and 3rd levels is an incredible glass tank of stingrays, sharks, sea turtles, and a variety of fish in which (depending on the level) you can enjoy both from above and below. (see photos). The museum has a variety of other wildlife including birds, freshwater fish, turtles, frogs, snakes, etc. and a plethora of reading material if you come ready to learn as well. The majority of the museum is sure to keep you engaged, but the top level is a very underwhelming garden in which needed a lot of work during our visit.. if you're in a time-crunch, I'd suggest skipping this level. \n\nBe aware -- the Frost Museum is definitely on the pricier side for standard museum prices at $30 / person on top of $15 parking. However, if you're familiar with the downtown Miami area, you may be able to locate a 'pay to park' space within walking distance that will lessen the cost of your day. \n\nGreat views of the Miami harbor &amp; beautiful aquarium. Worth the visit! :), Thank you for the feedback and for visiting the museum!, Written , April 15, 2022, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.",
  "Worth the visit for all ages, Adults, 3yr old, and 9 year old all enjoyed spending 3 hours here, not even seeing the whole place! The indoor/outdoor layout of this museum is unique and wonderful! We didn’t feel like we were visiting a museum but rather having a natural science experience in Miami. 3 floors of aquarium were fabulous and the dinosaur section was interesting. Lots of things to do and see within each area. Kids will not get bored.\nThey have an attached indoor parking lot, but very small and expensive. We couldn’t get a spot there but found nearby street (metered) parking easily. \nThe 1 cafe has lots of food options and seating, but lines were u too long for us to try it (visited on a rainy day during spring break, so very crowded)., Thank you for your visit! We are so glad you enjoyed your time at Frost Science. We hope to welcome you back again soon!, Written , April 24, 2023, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC., Traveled with family"

  "Well organized port, We disembarked from our cruise and found the lines moved quickly and efficiently in the terminal. The port staff had things well organized. Outside, it was easy to get to the taxi area to catch a ride to the airport. Our ride cost much less than what the cruise ship bus shuttle quoted us; plus we didn’t have to wait for 40 other passengers to fill the bus before it could leave. The taxi got us to the airport in less than 20 minutes.",
  "Rude employees and disorganized routine, Road signs to find the correct parking area were lacking.  Once parked we needed to cross the street from the garage to the terminal with the stopping of traffic by a crossing guard.  This guy thought he was the king of Miiami.  We were sure he waived us into the crosswalk after cars had stopped, but all of a sudden he went crazy.  He started waving his hands at us and yelling.  We stopped and he stood facing traffic, the took his right hand and again made a wave gesture to us.  We made a step and again he went nuts.  Third time, same gesture but we crossed without incident.  The people in the cars looked amazed and one lady looked like she was video taping what this guy was doing\n\nOnce across, we were shown where to stand for Royal Caribbean.  We waited in a line for about 10 minutes and then they opened a second line. Everybody behind us jumped over and made it in before we did.\n\nUpon our ships return, we were supposedly picked at random for a customs search and question session that took 45 minutes.  Random?  Bull.  It is discrimination because 2 guys traveled together., Traveled as a couple",
  "Cruise Ship Capital, I always enjoy finding a historical marker so I can learn a little more about the history of an area. The Port Miami historic marker is located in front of Bayside and at the entrance to the port, at the intersection of Biscayne Boulevard U.S. 1 and Port Boulevard. Marker F-818 was erected in 2014 by Florida East Coast Industries, Florida East Coast Railway, Foreign Affairs Center, Inc., Florida Trade Association and the Florida Department of State.\n\nAfter reading the marker I learned that the history of Port Miami goes back to 1895 when local land owners Julia Tuttle and and William and Mary Brickell convinced Henry Flagler to bring the railroad to Miami. The area was unincorporated and had only 300 residents when the first passenger train arrived in 1896. The original Port of Miami was where Maurice Ferré Park now sits. After making a channel, Flagler began offering passenger service between Miami and Key West in 1897. Flagler also owned a steamship company, Peninsular and Occidental (P&amp;O) which provided shipping service between Miami, Grenada, and Nassau. In the early 1900s, Government Cut was dredged along with a new channel to what is now called Bicentennial Park in downtown Miami. This new access to the mainland created the Main Channel which greatly improved the shipping access to the new port.\n\nAfter World War II Port Miami experienced a boom due to its proximity to the Caribbean and South America.  A port expansion resolution was adopted by the city of Miami on April 6, 1960. The port was moved to Dodge Island which was created from three historic islands Dodge, Lummus and Sam's Islands which were combined into one. The port was formally named Dante B. Fascell, in honor of 19-term Florida Congressman Dante Fascell, Port of Miami is also now known as the \"Cruise Capital of the World\" and \"Cargo Gateway of the Americas.\" The port is connected to Downtown Miami by Port Boulevard, a causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway and to the Watson Island via the Port Miami Tunnel. It is the largest passenger port in the world and one of the largest cargo ports in the United States. Over 5.5 million people a year pass through the port as they board such cruise lines as Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Disney, and MSC. The port provides hundreds of thousands of jo\\bs and it positively impacts Florida's economy by providing over 40 billion dollars each year."

  "Street food for the soul, If you’re a goody and want to know the true spirit of street food fashion while in Miami, don’t missy to stop at Tropical Park on the famous 40th. Jesus, food here got to another level, the smell, the presentation, the quality and above all, the mix of smoky fumes coming out each truck which will hit  to your senses and take you through a journey of prismatic ranges of flavours, all sort of varieties including Asian, American southern and Latin. But bear in mind, is only Fridays and Saturdays, price wise is reasonable compared with local restaurants, but a must do if you are adventurous in Miami. The downside is the horrendous traffic along the 40th street so be patient and enjoy., Traveled with family",
  "Big park in south Miami, Visiting this park wasn't on our list, but we accidentaly found it while looking for a place to eat our takeaway pizzas, while heading to the Dadeland mall further south.\nThe park is huge, and as I saw very popular with locals jogging and having picnic and bbq.

  "A Little Piece of Heaven!, Matheson is a little bit of heaven. Small beach in a sheltered area, great for families. Overlooking Biscayne Bay and the city of Miami but without the traffic. The Red Fish Restaurant has reopened and although pricey, very nice. The park offers Kyack and Paddle Board rentals and has walking trails and a Marina. Great place for riding your bike or walking among nature. Entrance fee is $5 on wkdays and $7 on wkends.",

  "Beautiful place to spend the day, We throughly enjoyed our day here.  The weather was perfect and it wasn’t crowded at all.  There were quite a few rules - no footballs on the beach, no floaties allowed in the water, no hammocks were allowed to be hung on the palm trees.   In other reviews, there were complaints about the smell or the water being gross.  In our experience, this was not the case.  The water is being fed into the atoll from the ocean and was being circulated to prevent it becoming stagnant.  It’s safe for young children (with supervision).  I too, thought it was a hidden gem.  We paid $9 for parking and stayed most of the afternoon.  The water is patrolled but does have a closing time.  We definitely will go back."

  "Amazing time at the Arsht Center, Friends &amp; I went to experience the Lasting Impressions exhibit.   The exhibit was absolutely phenomenal!  I cannot recommend it with more enthusiasm.\n\nHowever, this review is more about the amazing staff at the Arsht Center.  I have always enjoyed every show I have attended there, but this time I had the opportunity to interact with the staff much more than ever before.  They were ALL so accommodating, attentive, and professional.  But it was WAY beyond that.  They were helpful, professional, courteous and went out of their way to make each &amp; every person's experience the best time possible.  I will go back to the Arsht Center time &amp; time again, if for no other reason than to keep those marvelous folks employed!\n\nKudos to the Center for having amazing programming, but even more fantastic &amp; wonderful staff!!!, Traveled with friends",
  "Lovely concert hall, excellent staff, The Cleveland Orchestra in Miami is always such a treat, and the Knight Concert Hall is lovely. Booking tickets was easy and I would like to give a special mention to Marty H in the box office who answered all my queries (on a Saturday too!) promptly and courteously and couldn't have been more helpful. Marty sorted out all problems and made our visit even more enjoyable and stress-free., Traveled as a couple",
  "WICKED, Fantastic Experience was had when we saw: Wicked at the Adrian Arsht Ctr. This is a definite \"Must See\"! Our Orchestra seats were simply divine!! Staff kept everone in order and aided finding seating places. GetSome!!, Traveled as a couple"

  "Another one of Miami's beautiful botanical gardens, Once the home of noted horticulturalist Dr. David Fairchild and his wife Marian from 1928 until their deaths in 1954 and 1962 respectively, The Kampong is a 9-acre botanical garden in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida, an urban oasis with over 1,200 species of fruit trees, palms, ethnobotanical plans and teaching collections for botanical study. Located at 4013 South Douglas Road, it is open by advance reservation to visitors Tuesday through Friday. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, The Kampong's living collections include such tropical fruits as pomelo, 23 cultivars of avocado and 65 varieties of mango, palms, flowering trees, ficus, aroids and bamboo. In addition to the living collections, The Kampong also has living quarters for researchers, teachers and scientists, as well as meeting facilities for larger groups. The site also is well configured for weddings and outdoor events.",
  "Very Photogenic!, I had a delightful time at The Kampong.  I decided to bring my grandmother for the 11:30 self-guided tour and we adored it. A beautiful and relaxing residence, the Kampong is a perfect location for leisurely walks, dates, photography and I'm even thinking about throwing my wedding there when I get married in the future; they have a gorgeous, spacious event space. I fell in love  with the asian style decor and the oolite limestone columns ( which, was my favorite part of the entire building). \n\nAnd, of course, how large of a selection they had of plants and trees. a very well kept garden, the trails are fairly easy to follow and the majority of plants/trees have name tags. \n\nMy favorite tree was the banyan at the entrance. A tree with rich history, this one is perfect for photos, and of course... just getting lost in. \n\nCherry on top: My aunt's car battery died during her tour, and the staff were very eager to assist. \n\nThank you Kampong Gardens :)",
  "A nature hidden gem!, You'll love The Kampong if you enjoyed visiting the Miami Tropical Fairchild Garden. This garden is more curated and have a beautiful varieties of tropical fruits that are introduced to the United States from Asia. They have different types of mangoes, pineapples, avocados, pomegranates... Just make sure to buy your tickets online before showing up. You need to have a reservation to enter."

The atmosphere is very welcoming, there's people offering food and throwing footballs to you.  The shaded seats are also pretty nice since it is very hot in Florida.  The only thing bad about the stadium is that leaving the parking lot can take a long time, About an hour or two.  Worth themoney.",
  "Very helpful staff, The staff I encountered were all very helpful. The drinks were reasonably priced and there were lots of locations so not too long of lineups. There is at least one phone charging station for a fee but you still have to have juice left in your phone 'cause you need an app. The bathroom line moved fast which means they have several. The trek to get to Uber at the Walmart is way too far and needs to be brought in closer which is also for safety reasons., Traveled solo"

  "Historic place with a new purpose, Freedom Tower, set in the heart of Miami downtown can be considered as its prime landmark.\nIt's a historic edifice built in a Spanish style, resembling the one in Seville. It was built in the 20's of 20c.\nPrimary it served as Miami's newspaper offices, while later in the 60's it became some kind of Ellis island, but here in Miami.\nDuring many years it housed a growing number of Cuban refugees fleeing from Castro's regime. It was their first station in US to receive medical aid, examined and registered.\nToday, this iconic bldg houses a nice contemporary museum, mainly of Cuban and Latin American origin.",
  "Beautiful Historic Freedom Tower!, Beautiful historic building in downtown Miami among all the skyscrapers. They were not open when we arrived so did not get to see the museums, however the significance of the building was inspiring as a place for the Cubans to be processed and be welcomed to America. Love the name \"Freedom Tower\".",
  "Visiting Miami's Freedom Tower was a triple treat, Not only is the building historic and spectacular ( beautiful  ceiling in the foyer) but it has two museums. Go up the stairs to the 2nd floor and you will see the photo collection of the years that the arriving Cuban immigrants were processed here. Then, in the back of the room is the Kislak Center featuring the amazing Culture And Change In The Early Americas. Open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 6, this shows a wide arrangement of art from the many cultures in the Americas BEFORE the Spanish arrived. One of the most beautiful is the Mayan Ceramic Throne Box 800-1000 CE. Don't miss Freedom Tower...a Miami treasure. And.... you can get there by Metro Mover outer circle...."

  "Blast from the past, For someone who was born and raised in Miami and moved away 24 years ago, this was an opportunity to play tourist and re-discover memories and memorabilia this museum offers. What I appreciate about HistoryMiami were the many photographs and information offered about the native history, population growth, tourism industry, neighborhoods, icons, politics, and immigrants who came from Haiti and Cuba. Information about each exhibit is written in English and Spanish, and is summarized in a simple way.\n\nAt the time of this review, tickets were free and you can order them online by selecting a date and a  two-hour time slot. If my memory is correct, they only allow 25 people in the building within a two hour period. Validated parking is offered for a flat rate of $5. Park in the garage next door and they will validate your ticket.\n\nIf you’re someone looking to re-discover memories of the past like me, or you’re visiting the area for the first time and you’re looking to discover what’s behind the glass buildings and beaches, be sure to put this on your list!, Traveled as a couple",
  "Learned more about the area, There are two buildings of exhibits. If you are mainly interested in learning about the area - I suggest you go to the second building first. Also if you park at the multilevel parking garage across the street from the museum you can have your ticket stamped and only pay $5., Traveled as a couple",
  "Take the guided tour, The museum has greatly improved since it expanded into the South building (formerly the Miami Art Museum). I highly recommend attending one of the guided weekend tours of its permanent collections, then visiting the exhibits in the South building. Through Feb. 12 it is hosting an outstanding exhibit (curated by the NY Historical Society) entitled “Black Citizenship in the Age of Jim Crow.” The museum is accessible by metro rail; it validates parking at the cultural center garage on 2d Ave. The building is part of a complex that was designed by Phillip Johnson., Traveled with friends"

  "Highly recommended, This is a hidden gem in the Miami Design District.  It is a collector’s personal gallery of contemporary art, open to the public and is free of charge. It is not that easy to find since the exterior is very plain without any signage but is adjacent to its “competitor” the ICA and diagonally opposite the Museum Garage. While I am not a great fan of contemporary art, I found the three story exhibition space inviting and at least interesting. The third floor was especially nice with its paintings and artists that were more known to the general public. One thing that I must stress was its staff — they were great and very helpful in explaining the works and answering any questions. They were an important part in making the visit worthwhile., Traveled as a couple",
  "Don’t miss this Miami gem., Fabulous experience led by knowledgeable docent, Joel. Great variety of art. Registration and masks required.  Located in arts district with many lovely restaurants and shops. Parking garage across street. Highly recommend., Traveled as a couple",
  "First rate--deserves your attention, The de la Cruz Collection is one of the best private \"museums\" in the country showing international contemporary art in a brand new building. The work was, when we were there, mostly of established artists although there's a strong local link.  We were not familiar with most of the work so the written handouts on each of the 3 floors were extremely helpful.  Also, a staff member made herself available to escort us and talk about the artists and their work and how they related each to the other.  There wasn't a weak piece in the bunch.  I'd say the museum is doable in about 2 hours if your stroll, think and talk about the work.  Much less time for a run through.  Located in the Miami Art District, it's easy to get to. On-street parking is not a problem. Also of note, the de la Cruz home is open to the public by resrvation; we plan on doing this next time."

  "Great beer oasis, My wife and I were walking around the area visiting some breweries and we found this place at the end of the night, but wish we found it earlier.  It’s not too far from J Wakefield and once you walk in it’s almost like a beautiful little beer garden with a really cool bar area too.  We sat at the bar and talked with some people we met earlier who were also doing breweries in the area and really enjoyed the place.  The bartenders were really friendly, and we enjoyed sampling the different beers, the IPAs were really good especially the Hazy Coast.  They also had an extra cold Brazilian lager called Chopp they kept on the bar which was cheap and super refreshing for a hot day.  Highly recommend finding this place, it’s easy walking distance to other breweries in the area like Dogfish Head as well.",
  "An oasis in the Wynwood neighborhood!!!, An oasis in the Wynwood neighborhood!!! If you’re in the area chances are you’ve been walking under the sun, even if for a little while. And although there are several watering holes in the area -even with a lot of construction going on, I bet few, if any, are as refreshing, satisfying, and invigorating as Veza Sur Brewing Co; especially if you’re a beer lover. This place boasts a wide range of home-brewed beers, including seasonal ones and beer-based cocktails, which are beyond refreshing. Just having so many options from where to choose, makes a beer enthusiast happy!!! If you’re new to this place have a sampler and decide what beer you’re going for, don’t forget to listen to your server’s advice!!! And though you might not be here for the food, bites are agreeable, tasty, well portioned, and reasonably priced. So, all in all, this brewery is definitely a worthwhile pit stop for knocking back a few cold ones and recharging batteries for moving on with your Wynwood itinerary.",
  "Fun Wynwood area brewery with Peruvian food, Twelve family members gathered in the funky Wynwood area for a self designed brewery walking tour on a Friday afternoon the day before our cruise. Many of us had been traveling  all morning and were thirsty and hungry (in that order) . The three prior breweries did not have food so seeing the Peruvian food \"truck\" next to this brewery was great although I did not know anything about Peruvian food. I had the chicken bowl with kale and paired it with one of the Veza Sur beers. It was the best meal and it only cost about $20! Service was a little slow so we needed to flag down the server a few times.  As with many breweries, the largest part was outside. It was comfortable  with many large fans. I would definitely return here., Traveled with friends"

  "REAL VIBE, My wife and I stopped off in Domino Park in  Little Havana as part of a larger tour of the amazing city of Miami. Dozens of locals were frantically engaged in games of Dominos all across a relatively compact area. It was truly fascinating to watch and fantastic to take in the all encompassing Latin vibe. , Traveled as a couple",
  "Just like a location establishing scene in a movie, You know in the movies when they want to establish a setting, like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben?  This park would do well to establish Little Havana.  When we visited the park was packed with elderly Cuban playing dominoes.  The sounds of the dominoes clicking and the chatter of the conversation would make a perfect establishing shot.  A fun place to visit, but unless you are into dominos, not someplace that is absolutely necessary to visit.",
  "Walked by hoping to see some live action, but unfortunately it was closed due to the time I think!, This was on my list of attractions to see, however I think due to the time of day it was closed already.\n\nSo it's not really a park per se but it is a nice little enclave that I think would be much more relaxed than the bustling rest of Calle Ocho.\n \n There are tables inside where people can sit and play the game.\n\nIt is a nice little gated area on one side, and the other side is completely open.\n\nIt is definitely Domino-themed with Dominoes painted everywhere.\n\nNice area, and a wonderful theme to get you on a little slower pace., Traveled solo"

  "Great experience although pricey, I had a great time at Lock &amp; Load. I’ve been shooting a number of times and must say this facility was spotless. The service was fantastic from the counter and booking staff to the actual range marshals.\n\nMax walked us through the process and treated us like professionals. Our group had 3 people and a spectator. Everyone came from various experiences with guns, from novices to more advanced. Max walked us through the safety protocol and even treated our non-English speaking guest with patience.\n\nOverall I’d highly recommend this range for visitors and members. I’d be ecstatic to have a membership at a facility like this.\n\nThe only down side that every visitor should know is that it’s a very pricey experience. We went to the location believing some people would go for a fun package (three rifles) and others would go for just a single gun. When we arrived we were notified that there’s a minimum purchase of three rifles or a package of rifles then a handgun can be added. Looking back, the website does state this although could be clearer to a consumer. L&amp;L could improve on making that clearer.\n\nOverall it was an expensive but worth while adventure for me and my group!, Traveled with friends",
  "Great experience, Lock and Load was an amazing experience. They’re a museum section that show different weapons used in different wars. Also there’s a section where you can take photos. One of my favorite parts, was getting to shoot some of the guns, and our instructor was awesome!, Traveled with family",
  "Awesome! Just do it!, This was my first shooting experience and I have no words to express how good it was.\n\nFirst, you can choose a variety of weapons to shoot, either from an already defined package or a la carte. And believe me, they really have weapons of war, like for instance the same type they used to kill Bin Laden. If you want, you can add hand guns to the package you pick.\n\nThe shooting experience itself is perfect. You receive some previous instructions. Then you go to the firing range, were the instructor stays with you all the time, correcting you whenever needed, explaining each weapon you are going to use and providing all the information you need to enrich your shots. The best part is: you load the weapons by yourself, assisted by the instructor when needed. And you can either shoot in single fire mode or automatic mode. Each mode has different approaches and the instructor advises you about this.\n.\n\nEverything is so safe and professional. They are strongly concerned about avoiding accidents. The rules are strict and it must be like this. So, be responsible: although you are having fun, you are not playing videogame. You are really shooting fire weapons.\n\nMy instructor was Fabian and he was simply incredible. He knows a lot about weapons, he was very kind and he gave me some very useful tips during the process. So, if you can choose the instructor, you can ask for him. In the end, he did a ritual in which he gave me a medal stating that I took this experience at Lock and Load Miami.\n\nAre you thinking about it? Go for it! You won't regret."

  "Had a great time. Read on for lots of tips., We had a great time here but read on for some tips you will find very helpful:\n\nParking - You can't drive right to this park. We drove by it 3 times before we figured that out. Just park somewhere in Coconut grove nearby and walk over. Parking rates seem to be $3/hour and you can do through an app or machine. The app is nice in that you can add time from wherever you are. If you have anyone who can not walk far you might drop them off by the entrance.\n\nTours - You really want to do the tour and they only take 5 people at a time and run them at specific times. We loved it because it worked out the my girlfriend and I got a private tour. The tour costs 3$ each and is well worth it. If you don't do the tour you might not be that excited about your visit. \n\nOther fees - I think there is another fee to enter the state park of maybe $2 or so but we had an annual state parks pass.\n\nThe park is where one of the pioneers of Coconut Grove lived and we really enjoyed the guided tour which is the only way to see the house.\n\nThere are a lot of comfortable chairs on the porch and over the property to sit and relax and enjoy the view as well.",
  "Hidden Gem, The Barnacle is a true hidden locals gem in Coconut Grove, FL. What I love about it as a local is there are often events on the grounds such as the French Horns concert I'm going to with my family tomorrow night. It's peaceful and represents the lifestyle of the early settlers in the area that shaped our community. We love it.",
  "Hidden gem in Coconut Grove , Lovely house and garden, hidden away 8n Coconut Grove Miami. Limited opening hours Sun-Wed.\n$2 entrance fee $3 for house tour, bargain considering the home is beautifully preserved and the ground are tranquil. Enjoy the view of the miami from the porch in rocking chairs. Easily worth the fee. , Traveled as a couple"

  "description": "On Dec 4, 2019, Rubell Museum is expanding its commitment to serving as a public resource with the opening of a new 100,000 square-foot campus of which 80% will be publicly accessible. Housed in a former industrial building transformed by Selldorf Architects, the new museum features 53,000-square-feet of galleries, with 65% dedicated to long-term installations and 35% to special exhibitions, all drawn from the collection. The new museum is located in the Allapattah neighborhood of Miami, less than a mile from its current home and a short walk from the Santa Clara Metrorail stop."

  "Art for Art's Sake!, One of the aspects of the Miami art scene that I love is how it is ever-changing.  Over the years it has been so fun to visit the Rubell Collection when it was in Wynwood and now Allapattah.  Like the Medicis, the Rubells, and other collectors and making their own museums, raising up local and international artists and just out-running traditional museums since they are not beholden to anyone. \n\nWe visited and loved the spaces, loved the Kusama silver balls flooding the central hallway, loved the room full of Purvis Youngs, the Mauricio Cattelan self-portrait sculpture, the Kehinde Wiley, I could go on!  \n\nMy only complaint is that charging extra for small Kusama Infinity Rooms seems a little silly.  They are cool, we've stood in them but they are not $40 cool.  Make them free and let people just queue up to enjoy them.  Rubells have enough money and so does Kusama, nickle and diming for a peek is just a little tacky.",
  "Contemporary art gallery is second to none, One of the largest and far reaching private collections of contemporary art we have visited notable for its geographic diversity. The breadth of artists is amazing. The Rubells were early patrons of Jeff Koons, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Their continuing artist in residence continues to spotlight emerging artists. Cannot say enough good things about this expertly curated collection and it’s display. A very satisfying, informative and thought provoking experience. It was the largest collection of Keith Herring I ever expect to see in my life. Amazing paintings of twins and cowboys by Ghanaian Otis Kwame Kye Quaicoe the 2021 Artist in Residence. Swede Cajsa von Zeipel creates these acrylic sculptures that are grotesque and seductive all at once. Too much to describe. Not to mention there were 2 Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room installations there at the time of our visit. Sadly that was a temporary exhibit that is over. They were what initially attracted us to go but the entire collection is strong enough to stand on its own without them., Traveled as a couple",
  "Must see in Wynwood, Love this museum. It is a perfect size with enough collections to make you feel like it was worth the money (15 per person) but not so big that you are overwhelmed. You can do the whole gallery in 1-1.5 hours. Artists like Basquiat and Hirst, as well as newer contemporary artists. Great representation of many perspectives."

  "Great music, art and drinks in Little Havana, This venue on Calle Ocho is very friendly.  Pablo, the host, goes out his way to share the history of Little Havana to guests.  The artwork covering the walls of this bar is beautiful and full of historical significance. The live music was joyful and fun. They serve excellent mojitos.",
  "Superb location and drinks_DvB, While walking along the strip in Little Havana, this establishment’s eyecatching artwork, corner location, and open air seating beckoned. We sat outside at a petite bar that opened to the interior. There was plenty of seating around the patio at various tables and a bench, and the bar had five closely situated seats.\n\nThe bartender was a lovely young lady who spoke perhaps ten words the entire visit. She silently connected my laptop to the WiFi so I could work online, and seemed to float to and from the small bar as drinks needed refills.\n\nThe drinks were good. A bit pricey for my Texas taste, but really well made and fuerte. Standing up to leave sparked that realization of potency.\n\nMore than ten snack or appetizer items were listed on the bar menu. The shrimp and mahi mahi options were tempting. Next time I’m in Miami, I will definitely spend a couple of hours enjoying drinks, people-watching, and service at this artistic location., Traveled with friends",
  "Phenomenal live band! , The music drifts from the inside of Cubaocho and you can’t help but be drawn in as you pass by. It’s so intoxicating that you’ll find yourself dancing the night away. However, if you are not a dancer, there’s still plenty of people watching to do. All ages were on the dance floor. My husband and I and some friends all had a great time here. It was so nice to just see everyone enjoying such great live music. The cocktails were ok, not the best but not bad either. Our server was very attentive and kind. It really was the highlight of our trip to little Havana and I can’t wait to come back again. The band is just superb. This is by far the best place to be in little Havana. Don’t miss it! , Traveled with friends"

  "Super blue, This art exhibit was really cool!   The digital art on the walls you could sort of interact with.  For instance, if you touched a flower on the wall, it would then die.  It did not work for me, but it worked for others I saw! The other room was really cool too! I wish they only let in a certain amount of people at a time because it would’ve been cooler if there were less people in the room for better videos.  The two best parts of this museum were the cloud room and the mirror room. The cloud room was so cool! It was like you were walking around amongst the clouds! And if your friend does not go in with you they can see you on the outside by some windows.  The mirror room was awesome as well you were surrounded by mirrors mirrors and mirrors! Great for photos and videos! I even ran into some corners which was cool.  Lol!  One experience I totally did not get at all. It was like you were staring at a big wall of light. I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. And everyone’s just staring at it for a whole minute. I was like “what are we looking at?”  Another downside, and I hate to say it, but it was the people that worked there. I would try to make a joke with them, and they were all just very negative, very not happy people. I thought at first it was just the guy that was at the desk that charged us admission, but then the next guy we ran into in the first room giving directions was the same way as well as the girl that I talked to to buy my ticket for the cloud room.  I wanted to say if you don’t like your job leave.  But I don’t know if they actually get paid or are volunteers.    Maybe it’s a toxic environment to work in. I don’t know. But that’s the only reason I gave this a four instead of a five…BUT I do highly recommend going to this museum if you’re in town. It was a really cool experience!  Just don’t talk to the people that work there much🤣., Traveled with friends",
  "Immersive and expensive, Admission was $43 per person, once you go through the exhibit you can’t go back again. We spent an hour here. \n\nBasically there were three immersive experiences.  First we saw two rooms with floor to ceiling seasonal changes. We saw buds come from the ground, bloom with colorful flowers all around us, watch the leaves blow and the seasons change. There were mirrors on the walls and the floor which kept moving. I thought this was very cool and loved being immersed in the art.\n\nWe then put on booties, passed 3 holograms and were given instructions before going into a room where the color of light continuously changed. What was interesting about this exhibit was we couldn’t see the end of the room there were no boundaries the white walls meshed with the corners ceiling and floor. It was creative.\n\nThe third exhibit was a wow.  We started with a short film and then the door /screen opened up and we were in a maze of mirrors. We looked up and down and they were mirrors &amp; reflections everywhere.  There was a water feature and we stood on the side of the water and saw a reflection in the mirrors.  \n\nWe ended in a small, limited, very expensive gift shop. There was valet parking for $15 but we parked on the street at a meter., Traveled as a couple",
  "OK for adult, overpriced for a toddler, I had just been to San Francisco's teamLab's exhibit at the Asian Art Museum called Continuity and loved it so much that I decided to check out Superblue.\n\nIt was just ok, especially because I went with my 4 year old and it was too abstract (and too expensive) for him. teamLab was very exciting for him (even though Miami's wasn't interactive the way SF's was) and the last room seemed like we had landed in Planet Krypton so we had fun in that maze.\n\nThe adult price felt ok but it is overpriced at $35 for a a child under 12 who couldn't quite evoke emotions out of him."

  "Excellent way to get around Miami if you don't have a Lamborghini to hand, What an excellent way to get around Miami. We paid $5,65 each to travel from South Miami Ave. over to Superblue Miami (and back) and we could have continued to use the same ticket all day and evening if we had the need. We found the trains to be clean, frequent and a great way to see the way of the land in this beautiful city. And the staff we met were more than happy to help us poor foreigners to navigate. Perfect!",
  "Use it! It works!, My husband and I visited Miami in the week leading up to the Super Bowl, when traffic downtown was insane.  In order to connect after I spent the day working and he spent the day baking, we chose Metrorail stops outside of downtown as a rendezvous, then found dinner nearby.  It was a great plan.  Metrorail is cheap and gets you there quickly.  ",
  "Easy Access to and from Airport, We flew into Miami and purchased a week pass that allowed us to the use the metrorail and the buses.  It was a very affordable means to travel around the city and especially from the airport to our hotel in downtown Miami.  Way cheaper than using Uber, taxis or renting a car."

  "Great instructor and a great time., Rodolfo was an excellent instructor. He was patient and knowledgeable.  Using these traits he was able to get everyone in our party (13-50 years old) up and wake surfing despite none of us having any real experience.  If u want to spend a beautiful few hours on Biscayne Bay and  learn to wakeboard or wake surf, we highly recommend Gator Bait and Rodolfo., Traveled with family",
  "Great for Family Vacation, We really enjoyed our trip with Molly and Nick! They arrived early and were extremely courteous and enthusiastic. Loved the G25, our family of 6 owns a wakeboard boat so we were already experienced riders, so the G25 was a perfect compliment to our riding ability. We loved riding in the bay, Nick and Molly provided boards and gear for both surfing and wakeboarding. Seeing Dolphins was a bonus! We will definitely be doing this again on our next trip to Miami. , Traveled with family",
  "2 teenage boys from Minnesota!!, My husband and I reserved time with Marcos and Gator Bait for a couple hours in our stay in Florida over spring break.  Coming from Minnesota, the boys hadn't been in the water since last August/September.  He was great with finding the calmest part of the Bay as it was an extremely windy day.  The boys enjoyed wakeboarding and wakesurfing!  He was so patient and provided some great tips so the boys could try some tricks and accomplish them!  Thanks Marcos!  If we ever make it back to Miami we will for sure be back! \nLori Johnson"

  "Hidden jewel...far better than the Zoo..,  This is a State of Florida  Railroad Museum located right next to the Miami Zoo. Wonderful collection of Heavy Weight and Streamline Passenger Trains. Home to the Presidential Car No. 1. and the famous California Zephyr Dome Car Silver Crescent. Other Zephyr equipment includes Silver Vale, Silver Slumber ,Silver Stag, Silver Treasure and E-9 9913.    Lots of on site display items including  an operational  2'-0\" gauge train ride , model train room and multiple museum display areas. Standard Gauge Train ride on the first Saturday of every month.  Lots of locations for photo shoots and parties .",
  "A hidden gem!, Average railroad museum display but they have an icon - The Ferdinand Magellan - the rail car of US Presidents before Air Force One. Admission to get in is $10. They didn't mention that the Magellan costs $5 extra - figured that out when we got out there. Luckily we caught the last tour of the day. Amazing opportunity to see that car. A lot of history. Nice gift shop. If you're a rail fan, it's a must see.",
  "Great visit especially for children., We visited this museum prior to going to the adjacent Zoo.  Both facilities are situated on the former site of NAS Richmond a Lighter Than Air (LTA) Naval Airship Base.  The GCRM occupies some of the footprint of the former hangar one.\n  \nAdult admission is eight dollars.  We were fortunate that Seniors have free admission on Wednesdays.\n\nThere are 12 different cars and a partial train set up on 4 different sections of track. Of particular interest were the \"Ferdinand Magellan\" presidential car, an Army hospital car, the \"Jim Crow\" car which depicts how people were segregated in the past and the \"California Zephyr\" train with its dome car.  In addition there is a separate building which houses model display exhibits.  There are a variety of vehicles outside in various states of repair and restoration.  The unfortunate thing is that some cars are deteriorating badly and are exposed to the elements.\n \nThere are playgrounds and picnic areas on the grounds and a gift shop.  For railroad buffs and for the opportunity to show children glimpses of the past the museum is certainly worth a visit. Allow about an hour."

  "An enriching historical experience, If you are even the slightest bit interested in history, this is an absolute must.  So rare to be able to learn about historical events from people who were directly there and lived it. \n\nLike many, my understanding of the Bay of Pigs came from a brief mention in history class, having watched the 13 Days movie and learned a bit about Cuban history on my own. The veterans with whom I was able to speak were so tremendously generous with their time in explaining the history leading up to and through the mission. The museum is undergoing some changes as there are plans to expand (exciting to hear) but there is still a wealth of interesting artifacts, photographs, uniforms, weapons from the mission, you name it, they have it. \n\nIf you are in and around Little Havana and have any interest in history this is an hidden gem and must see. Real history doesn't always play out like a Disney movie, and I very genuinely appreciated the nuance with which this complicated event in world history is presented. These men have pride in their valor and the brotherhood they built (deservedly so) but are frank and honest in discussing the mission itself, its prospects for success and the ongoing problems in Cuba. Please don't take my word for it, and stop by yourself.",
  "One of the best museum tours I have ever had., The Bay of Pigs Museum is excellent! My brother and I visited when we were in Miami. In the museum we were given a tour by two great people. One was the sister of a participant in the Bay of Pigs and the other was one of the young men trained by the CIA to participate in the Bay of Pigs. We got to hear firsthand from the tour guide that was held prisoner by the Castro regime for a year. He told us about the prisons, the incompetence of the U.S. government in planning the ill-fated invasion and about life under the Castro regime. In just two hours we learned so much! This place is truly a treasure! As an added bonus, admission was free. \n\nI strongly recommend this place to any traveler who finds themselves in Miami.",
  "Amazing opportunity to meet a real life hero and hear his story, I walked in to this small unassuming space with very low expectations and even lower knowledge about Cuba and the bay of pigs. Had the absolute pleasure of spending a few hours with Carlos and walked out feeling humbled and honoured to have met him and shared this time together. Went with my 15 year old son who was fascinated to hear the decisions Carlos was making at his age when the biggest call most teenagers these days have to make is if you’re PlayStation or Xbox. Carlos exudes charm, hospitality and pride and the stories he had to tell were incredible. 100% worth the trip. Thank you Carlos, Traveled with family"

  "An historic Blacks-Only beach minutes from Miami, This is a different kind of beach than you are perhaps expecting. The sandy part is kept natural - so not raked and groomed. Obviously of great benefit to the surrounding nature and I am delighted that there are areas striving to keep the natural world in mind. It is also a deeply historic and fascinating place as it harkens back to a time when the black community was kept off the beaches and away from any shoreline recreation. In response to the great need to service this population's reasonable desires for equality, the first coloured beach was formed. This is the vestiges of that historic and important era. There are historic plaques and some historic buildings. The carousel has been refurbished (though as yet not operating) and a tourist train (also not operating). If you love American history, this place is important and we are lucky there is so much of it to see and from which to learn. And yes, the water is lovely. \n\nThere is a fee of $8 per car - nominal and helps support this historic park. There is a free and informative tour given by a friendly, accommodating young man named Charlie. Charlie knows his flora and fauna and his history and is a passionate supporter of the work being done at this gem location. Shelters can be rented and when we were there a big private party with live music was happening. This beach is what you make of it and we loved it.",
  "Eco historic tour, I booked a free eco historic tour with Charlie. We did the tour on 2/13/21. Charlie was very understanding of us being 5 minutes late for the tour. He was very positive, professional, and honest. We began the tour and he painted a detailed picture of the historical significance of the park to the African American community. The tour also included some very key facts about the beach’s progression from the 1950s and 1960s to now. Although the tour was free, we tipped Charlie because of his very in-depth explanation and his passion for upholding the beauty and ecology of this beach. We did a photo op at the cabins which were so beautifully painted and maintained. This beach also has the worlds largest sandcastle which is a magnificent sight itself. The beach was definitely well maintained and I would recommend anyone visit during their time in Miami. The improvements and additions that are going to be made in the next few years will only further enrich the experience of this historical gem., Traveled as a couple",
  "Lots of history but not a lot to see unless you do a tour, We watched a video on the park before we drove over and it was really interesting. Google Maps put us in another park nearby with an $8 entrance fee so be careful. We checked that out for a while and then asked where the historic stuff was and they told us it was in the next park. We walked over as I didn't want to pay another $8 for a short time. It takes about 30 minutes to walk between the parks on a trail and the beach. \n\nWe were a little disappointed as there was not that much to see. There were a number of signs explaining the history which was interesting. The Carousel was closed and it's not even possible to see anything. Maybe this park would be really interesting with a tour. There are some remnants of the railroad."

  "Great little brewery with pop culture!, My wife and I were leaving Dogfish Head brewing just down the street when we saw this little brewery and decided to stop in.  What really drew us in was the amazing murals and artwork of Star Wars.  There is a nice outside patio area with picnic tables and they also had a food stand. Inside was really cool with a life-sized table of Hans Solo in carbonite and lots more artwork to look at.  The bar tender was friendly and we enjoyed sampling their beers, especially the IPA.  Very fun vibe at this place and lots of great artwork to enjoy.  Easy walking to several other places as well.",
  "Raise Your Glass, Really cool brewery. On our visit to Miami from Arizona, we decided to spend one of our days brewery hoping and this was one of our stops. This brewery not only had some really good beer, but the art was on point for sure. The staff were really inviting, helpful and super nice. I would highly recommend checking this place out and will most likely return myself when I come back to Miami. Thank you for the neat experience!",
  "Good beer and a must if you're a Star Wars fan , The brewery offers a really good choice of stouts and sours all within a Star Wars inspired bar area. There is an onsite food truck which we didnt try but it looked and smelt really good. The back story of J.Wakefield is cool as he started off a small local brewer and then crowd funded to set up the current brewery. A close walk to Wynwood Walls so worth a cheeky beer stop. , Traveled as a couple"

  "Friendly service with a waterfront view, This place is wonderful ! Beautiful and Spacious with wonderful upscale food trucks, cornhole and a great waterfront location. PLUS after having a weekend of not so friendly service at other places, it was extremely refreshing to have such welcoming service ! Lauren the service manager went above and beyond. Definitely recommend. If you pull up on your boat your docking fee is used as a drinking credit !, Traveled with friends",
  "Fun Bar, Good Atmosphere , The wharf is a fun bar and a great place to go with friends if you’re looking for a night out in Miami. It’s a large bar on the water, the music is good, and if you get hungry there are food trucks around the bar itself. If you want to go outside you can, the bar is set up so the doors are slid open and there’s always a nice breeze. There are tables for you to sit at inside and outside and the prices are very reasonable. Overall my visit to The Wharf was very fun, Thank you so much for the kind review, Monica! We loved reading about your time with us and we are so happy you enjoyed your experience. It was a pleasure having you and we look forward to your next visit! , Written , March 15, 2021, This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC., Traveled with friends",
  "Great Concept, This place has many bars spread across a big lot and food trucks. Unique concept bordering the river. Good drinks and you get to watch all kinds of boats up and down the river. We went on a Saturday afternoon and they had treats and things for dogs. Great family ambiance but also good for drinks with friends"

  "The real deal, If you want to feel like you are actually trying to escape prison this is the place to go. Such an amazing experience. I do recommend going with adults or at least kids 16 and older. It was scary for our 13 year old as the place feels and sounds just like you are in prison. It was amazing and I highly recommend doing it at least once. We will absolutely be going back when we visit Miami again in the future. The supervisors were so fun and engaged and really got into the mood and played along to keep you feeling like you were never going to escape. Great experience had by all. We did not escape,the room was hard but again bring adults at least 16 and older and I believe your chances of escaping will improve. I can’t express enough how real the background and sounds and setting of the place just made the whole experience seem so real.     , Traveled with family",
  "Escaped Zodiac Killer with 13 seconds left 👌🏻, Me and my girlfriend did the Zodiac Killer escape room last weekend, my first escape room. Would highly recommend, the detail of the room and the puzzles are excellent and I thought our game host Juan was incredible, very energetic and really threw himself into the performance I thought.\n\nWould go back, although I think the price is a little on the high side for 2 people. Worth it for a special occasion but a bit pricey to go back too regularly with just 2 people playing. ",
  "Great experience, We did Prison Break, which was great.  The experience is made even better by the game master, Sean.  We've tried many escape rooms in South Florida and this was definitely one of the better places.  You get locked into real prison cells, have foul smells seeping in.  Very realistic.  Challenging puzzles.  We didn't escape, but that was on us.  Other places make it near impossible to escape through no fault of your own.   Highly recommend."

  "A museum to visit, This museum is walking distance from the Walls art museum. It was an opportunity to learn about this popular street art, everything is well documented. Is a place to visit. By the way, with the visit to the Walls art museum, you have 50% discount in the ticket, good opportunity to enjoy both museums.",
  "New way to look at graffiti , My family visited the museum as a private event. We enjoyed walking through the exhibits and read about the history of this art form. The staff was welcoming and friendly. This is a small museum that requires about 45 minutes to walk through.Nice little gift shop just before you exit. \nWe also enjoyed the area around the museum and the artwork it offered., Traveled with friends",
  "Glad I turned back around.  Literally one of a kind!, I was headed to catch a Lyft ride to the airport when two guys on the street approached me and told me I should visit the museum. They said it was the only graffiti museum in the US, so I decided to turn back around. I'm very happy I did as it was a highlight of the trip. The museum employees are very passionate about their work and I believe are artists themselves. I gained a new appreciation for street art after learning to paint earlier that day at the The Light Box. The museum was a great way to reiterate that experience. It's a small museum, but no shortage of history and affordable art for sale. When you go to other museums (at least in my experience), you kind of wonder around on your own. Here, you can ask lots of questions and really get into conversations about the art. I was happy to support them by also purchasing a book and a few other things. They even threw in a magazine which was super nice and made my day.  (It was my birthday, but they didn't know that.)  I will be back."

  "Glad I went, I don't usually like modern art, but, did enjoy the collection on exhibit here when I came in June. The pieces  were varied- very colorful, emotional or otherwise engaging. It was easy to obtain tickets online and the museum was not crowded.  An enjoyable afternoon activity for a hot day.",
  "Impressive and varied exhibits!, I loved all the exhibits at the Institute of Contemporary Art on 41st Street starting with the parking ramp across the street. It's incredible!\n\nThe variety of art on exhibit was very impressive in it's variety, and depth and it's ability to draw me in. There was some of the most exciting abstract painting I've ever seen, very inventive and expressive sculpture, and a retrospective on an amazing feminist artist, and more.\n\nAnd it's free! I'm very grateful that I got to visit it.",
  "Not convincing this time, When I am in Miami, I usually visit the ICA, and usually their exhibitions are good, but unfortunately this time I did not like it too much. There were some good pieces, but the majority did not convince. Hopefully their next exhibition will be better…. I will give them another try."

  "Park outside if crowded. Bike ride carefully., We did this for the first time today and enjoyed it. There is one 15 mile loop which the tram does for $27 or you can rent a bike or ride your own. The park fills up early and it can be most efficient to park on Tamiami trail and ride your bike in. The park costs $30 to enter. You might consider an annual national parks pass for $80. A surprising number of people had bike wipeouts so be careful. I would also advise slower traffic to ride along one side and those who ride fast to be careful passing.  , Traveled as a couple",
  "Biking the 15-mile loop trail is a wonderful and memorable experience in Shark Valley (bike rental at Visitor Center), Rent a bike for the 15 mile loop trail in Shark Valley! You'll see lots of 'gators (babies and adults), extraordinary birds and beautiful vistas. Mid-way, you can stop and go up the observation tower to get even better views.\n\nHelpful hints (some specific to busy holiday weekends):\n1) The parking lot is not large and can fill up early. Even though it's not officially ok, you can park on the main road.\n2) Bike rentals get \"sold out' so book early on-line.\n3) Let the bike rental folks know if you want a helmet (and you are older than a kid/teenager). They will try to talk you out of it, but they are available if you are politely persistent.\n4) The observation tower is wonderfully accessible with a spiral ramp (without stairs).\n5) Bring LOTS OF WATER to hydrate. There is no shade and the sun is strong.\n\nMany thanks to the park ranger (young man with a beard) who listened to our questions and gave clear and helpful responses. We are very appreciative.",
  "Crowded when I went, but my favorite visitor center at the Everglades, At 2pm on a Wednesday in January, we had to wait about 20 minutes to enter Shark Valley. The rangers implement a car-in, car-out process, so if the lot is full, you need to wait until a car leaves to be allowed in. Luckily, it was late enough that people were leaving pretty regularly, and once we got into the visitor center lot, at least we were guaranteed a parking spot! The visitor center was great. Lots of information, helpful rangers and staff, and a hub for activities such as the tram tour and bike rentals. I opted to rent a bike and ride the Shark Valley Loop trail. The visitor center has clean, working facilities and a fountain to fill water bottles."

  "Skyviews, This was one of the highlights of our trip! You get to see the city lights of Miami. The ride last probably 10 mins (maybe a little longer). We are from a small beach town, so seeing the hustle and bustle of the city at night was super cool. We’d recommend everyone check this out while in Miami., Traveled as a couple",
  "Views of downtown Miami, Great location and views of downtown Miami, but a little bit overpriced in my opinion. Parking at the Bayside will also cost you a bit, even if it's for a few minutes on a weekend evening. I suggest making this part of your Bayside visit. You will save some money. The cabins are climate controlled, so you can just relax and take in the views. Very good for families with small kids., Traveled with family",
  "So wonderful and very comfortable!!, What a great view we had of the city and the waterfront area. The price was reasonable and the experience was great. The gondola could comfortably hold probably 6 adults but I was very happy to have the worker let my 10 year old grandson and I have one all to ourselves and not have to share it with strangers. He had a fear of heights and I was worried that it was not going to be easy if he became anxious and there were others there looking at him but that was not the case at all, he loved it and was so very happy. We took excellent photos and were very pleased with the length of time we were on it as I expected it to be a very much shorter adventure and was so happy to have had this great time with him. This is a must do for all ages."

  "description": "Wings Over Miami Air Museum serves as a tribute to those veterans and aviators who pioneered civilian and military aviation. With this goal in mind, the museum both displays and flies military and classic aircraft to share the rich history of flight. It provides an operating legacy of aircraft with an insight to the legends of the pilots who flew them.This is a charming little museum that provides an opportunity for a close-up look at classic and war bird aircraft. They have many enclosed cases filled with models and other memorabilia. Often a visitor will see plane restoration in process and on weekends, people may chat with the pilots of the planes if they are in the hangar.While visitors can't climb on the planes, cameras are welcomed and the staff is very friendly."

  "very involved tour guide, I benefitted from being the sole visitor and a tour from one of the founders.  Incredible life experience translated into the planes on display, a good number of which he seems to own or has flown.  That really elevated this.  Otherwise, it's impressive that the planes still FLY.  The museum part itself is better appreciated by a hobbyist - models, models, models; and the historical context is light.  There's also a military vingette hallway that I probably could have given more time to - assuming the the videos were playing (am sure one could ask).  With the personal tour, I'd call it 5 stars if you have aviation interest, without either the personal attention or interest on your part, maybe a 3.  Not expensive, but you have to get out to the executive airport so weigh that in your decision.",
  "Small but well maintained, Visited for a couple of hours on our way from Miami to Fort Myers. It is easy to find - at the Miami Executive Airport. Run by man and wife team who greeted us pleasantly and gave us information on how to proceed. It is located in one hangar with about 20 aircraft exhibits and lots of information easy to walk around and well lit. There is a small gift shop which is quite well stocked. There is no cafe but there is a drinks vending machine. There are no food outlets nearby. There are restrooms. Well worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, Traveled as a couple",
  "Interesting Air Museum that honours military and civilian aviation, Hello\nwe decided to go and see this museum during our 4 day stay in Florida City. The museum is located on an Airport. It is  located at Kendall-Tamiami Airport in Miami-Dade County. You can just drive into the airport and the museum is clearly sign posted. There was plenty of parking outside the museum building. We entered through the gift shop and paid $20 for 2 adults( kids were $6 and pensioners were $7). The place opens from 10am to 5pm Wed- Sat and Sunday 12pm to 5pm. It is closed on Monday and Tuesdays.\n\nAfter we had paid we went into a door that took us into a museum. There were lot's about the 2nd world war and military stuff and tents and history about the war. Pilots helmets and an engine cut in half which you could actually see working. We then went into another huge hanger where all the planes were kept. Going back a few years , a pilot called Kermit Weeks had an Aviation Museum here but as his collection grew and grew he needed more space and moved everything away. People in the area missed the museum so some people decided to open their own up. \n\nFour military and classic plane enthusiasts got together and decided to change the existing hanger into “Wings Over Miami Air Museum”. The museum’s new  founders were  Walter Orth, Larry Ploucha, Vincent Tirado and Tom Righetti and they  dreamed of a flying museum. They worked with Kermit Weeks who helped them get everything together. \n\nWe went into the large hanger and saw loads of classic and military planes that had been beautifully restored. There were some men working on some of the planes and we spoke to some of them. One man said that the helmet in the museum near the entrance was actually his. Most of the planes are still flown and are taken out now and then. There were jet planes and older propeller planes and a few newer modern planes. Such as a  1945 North American SNJ-6 and a 1968 Aero L29-R Delfin Jet and a 1995 Yakovlev Yak 52. All the planes were so clean and shiny they looked new. Clearly the people who have restored these planes loved doing so. There were bout 15 planes inside the hanger and 1 large plane outdoors. Each plane had a description of what it was and what it could do etc. Height, speed etc. People were about so you could ask any questions too. \n\nWe then went outdoors and looked at the large black plane. It was a seaplane which needed restoring. We spent about 1 hour and 15 minutes looking round the museum and really enjoyed it. Thought the entrance fee was sensible. As you exit you go back through the gift shop which has rest rooms which we used. When we were at the museum we were the only visitors there which was quite a surprise. Maybe because it was January and most people had gone back to work. I am glad I went here as it was very interesting. As we were leaving we saw the men pulling a plane outdoors that they were going to fly that day. I think this place is more for adults as kids may get abit bored after a while. If you are into flying and planes and the history of planes you will love it all. I am not that into it but I really enjoyed it( hubby is more into planes etc than me). Well worth going to . They also hold events during the year that maybe worth going to., Traveled as a couple"

  "Great location, watch out for predatory parking company!, We had a lovely pizza and meatballs at Ironside Pizza. You pay for the ambience. Very nice outdoor seating for social distancing. WARNING regarding the parking: The parking located adjacent to the Ironside property is run by a company called Professional Parking Management. Feel free to look them up. Parking is payable via the PayByPhone app which is fine, BUT if you are over by any amount of time these guys will politely mail you a ticket with photos and time stamps just like the traffic cameras for a traffic violation but it will be an expired parking session. Make sure you plan for at least 30 minutes more than you expect via the PayByPhone app to make sure you don't get a bill for 85.00 a few days after your visit. I paid for my time and went over by a few minutes ... Great Location, Parking Management are somehow legalized, extortioners! Ironside should reconsider their business dealings with this unreputable organization. ",
  "Best place to hang out outdoors, This place is perfect to relax outdoors and enjoy the trees, butterflies, and pizza. It's a perfect outdoor dining area, and thanks to the trees it feels very refreshing. There is everything you need, even a place to leave your kids. There's a hair and nail salon, shops, galleries, art, and the cutest lemon garden. With the Covid-19 situation it was great to find a place to be outdoors with lots of space. Would 100% recommend.",
  "Amazing Sunday brunch at Ironside!, I love this place because it’s so green and authentic. Ironside kitchen is delicious and the bakery makes the best poached eggs I’ve tried! They also have really cool art and interesting galleries/shops to look around. Oh and it’s pet friendly!, Traveled with friends"

  "Fastest game goes fast, Went to the Casino Miami to observe Jai Alai games. This is one of the few places left that still hold pro games. It was the 1st time watching the game. Had to check online for rules. The players were very skillful and the game goes very fast. They swing the ball out of the baskets at very high speed. In early afternoon there is almost no one there so it was easy to get close. Unfortunately there is a chain fence that limits visibility.  It is there for a purpose, the ball could kill a spectator at that speed. It was fun watching the matches. The casino is nice and there is plenty of free parking. Nearby Cuban restaurants are great., Traveled with family",
  "Geat Signup Bonus, Plenty of Slot Machines Jai alai in season, Friendly staff, with modern slot machines.  Be usre to signup for the players card.
