The decision is being handed down \\napproximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan \\nSumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  \\n(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to \\ndo the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning \\nthe Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the \\nindividual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a \\ndecision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not \\nwriting the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the \\nruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently \\nlikelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are \\nunlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we \\nbelieve we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up \\nvalue by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not \\nmake an offer of settlement.  \\n\\nWe expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement \\nwill be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.

The \\ncontract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it \\nis only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the \\nTransportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price \\nreduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete.

He is expected to announce how bidding into the\\nforward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs.\\n\\n     The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar\\nfiling with federal regulators in the near future, sources said.\\n\\n     In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a\\nmeasure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a\\nmajority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of\\nmarket power, the ISO has said in prior meetings.\\n\\n     Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators\\ncan influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power\\noccurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of\\ngeneration ownership \\\&quot;allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high\\ndemand periods.\\\&quot;\\n\\n     About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in\\nthe spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO.\\n\\n     In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to\\nenter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the\\ndaily market price fluctuations.\\n\\n     Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a \\\&quot;key\\nsource of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,\\\&quot; according to an ISO\\nreport.\\n\\n     The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid\\noperator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required\\nto approve such an action.\\n\\n     EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action\\n\\n\\n\\n     The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to\\nGary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board.\\nHeath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news\\nconference.\\n\\n     \\\&quot;We're trying to find out what's behind this,\\\&quot; Heath told Dow Jones\\nNewswires. \\\&quot;We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It\\ncame as a surprise.\\\&quot;\\n\\n     Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to\\neclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month.\\n\\n     FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market\\nthis past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably\\ncompetitive and participants manipulate the market.

Kay suggests distributing the agreement internally and to the cities, with an explanation that they are still considering it.

Reagan asks if the issues have been incorporated into the agreement and if it can be sent to Marvin. Kay mentions that there are formatting challenges and lots that need to be fixed. Reagan lists some questions that may arise regarding liquidated damages, events of default and remedies, billing and payment netting, and miscellaneous terms.</span></div></div>

The decision is being handed down \napproximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan \nSumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  \n(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to \ndo the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning \nthe Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the \nindividual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a \ndecision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not \nwriting the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the \nruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently \nlikelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are \nunlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we \nbelieve we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up \nvalue by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not \nmake an offer of settlement.  \n\nWe expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement \nwill be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each \nof you is contacted as soon as possible with the result."

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties \napproximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final \nfigure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the \nprincipal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take \nas long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part \nof the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The \nopinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" \nrather than applying the provisions of the contract.  \n\nFor example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that \nthe  \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after \npayments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are \nunacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow \nJ-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and \ntherefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says \nthat the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature \nof a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.\n\nAs far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that \nthe clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The \ncontract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it \nis only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the \nTransportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price \nreduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This \nstatement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the \nopinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties \nhave an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.\n\nEqually disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our \nsubmission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the \nrestitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon \nwhich the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point \nat the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have \nbeen a given. \n\nAlthough I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our \nother counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and \ndescribe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\".  \nUnfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country \n(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for \nrecourse.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or \nexpected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from \neach of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster \nride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in \nfact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. \n\nPlease call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if \nyou wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 \n783 6582.  Many thanks."

He is expected to announce how bidding into the\nforward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs.\n\n     The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar\nfiling with federal regulators in the near future, sources said.\n\n     In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a\nmeasure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a\nmajority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of\nmarket power, the ISO has said in prior meetings.\n\n     Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators\ncan influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power\noccurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of\ngeneration ownership \"allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high\ndemand periods.\"\n\n     About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in\nthe spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO.\n\n     In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to\nenter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the\ndaily market price fluctuations.\n\n     Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a \"key\nsource of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,\" according to an ISO\nreport.\n\n     The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid\noperator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required\nto approve such an action.\n\n     EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action\n\n\n\n     The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to\nGary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board.\nHeath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news\nconference.\n\n     \"We're trying to find out what's behind this,\" Heath told Dow Jones\nNewswires. \"We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It\ncame as a surprise.\"\n\n     Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to\neclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month.\n\n     FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market\nthis past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably\ncompetitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have\nblamed the ISO for this summer's power woes.\n\n     -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00\n\n     0307GMT\n\n\n\n\nMichael E.
