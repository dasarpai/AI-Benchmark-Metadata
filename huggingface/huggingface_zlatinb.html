The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies\n[26]in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Departmers of\n[27]State which were called to our attention in a lester from the General\n[28]Counsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.\n[30]on gtetions. a\n[32]2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the ' -\n[33]Commission's report that he vas writing, he sould have to deal with the :\n[34]question of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! departure {rom the USSR = and\n[35]‘the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or\n[36]He expressed his belief that they probably sere\n[37]not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn tne post-Stalinera. —\n[39]However, he war.ted tu be sure in his own mir. that our information was\n[40]not in conflict with that which the Commission: had received from State\n[41]since all of that information wsuld remain in the records of the\n[43]Commission.\n[45]suspicious in any ‘ay.\n[47]_ 3. After seating my belief that. there was no real disagreement yur\n[48]inconsistency between the information from CLA ard that from State, I\n[49]‘expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questiazs:\n[51]- ; fa. Da the Soviet :\n[52]Oocurnent Number 1471-3 6 4 . 4\n[54]for FOIA Review on JUN 1976 es tory.\n[56]jaw, a: Be ERNE\n[58]13-00000\n[60]a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet\n[61]“citizens married tu forcign natignals to emigrate from the —\n[62]Sovict Union to the homelands of their spouses? 7\n[64]~ ‘b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to.\n[65]accompany (i.e. depart'simultancously with) their spouses“.\n[66]from the Soviet Union? . / Cre\n[68]c. How long does it.take such Soviet citizens to get\n[69]Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application\n[70]to granting of visas)? : ,\n[72]4. Concerning the first two questions (a and 3b above) I pointed out .\n[74]_-_that we had addcessed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens\n[75]being allowed to accompany their spsuses abroad while State dealt only\n[77]with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being 2tiawed\n[78]to emigrate without reference to whether or not they Ieft simultaneously\n[79]with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented\n[80]that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and\n[82]State had said in that light.\n[84]5. By way ar further explanation, I said that the statements in\n[85]piragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being\n[86]permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based ona\n[87]review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only focr of\n[88]these cascs did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of rer foreign\n[89]husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the\n[90]remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit u¢ to\n[91]categorize them. I added that although State's information began by\n[92]citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the\n[93]American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December\n[94]1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens\n[95]who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed\n[96]information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these\n[97]whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.\n[99]16, in response to\n[101]13-00000\n[103]J\n[104]” 6, In response ty a question from Mr. Slawsaa I stated that most\n[105]of the 26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign\n[107]students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons,\n[109]_ and while a number of cases have certain points is common, they bear\n[110]‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who -\n[111]‘married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April\n[113]1964 memorandum to tre Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson\n[115]‘indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter.\n[117]“ 7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to\n[119]process exit visas for Suvict citizens married to foreign nationals\n[120](question 3c above), I stated that, in my upinion, the information\n[121]provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's Ictter)\n[122]substantially corresponded to the views expressed im paragraphs 6 and 7\n[123]of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson\n[124]asked if it would be pussitle to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum\n[125]of 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our\n[126]statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.\n[128]8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion\n[129]he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved.\n[131]- However, he asked that «e send a brief written reply to the Commission's\n[133]letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning\n[134]the basis for staternents included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. [This\n[135]would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed\n[136]to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet\n[138]visa applications. ]\n[140]9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sendiing parts of his report\n[141]dealing with the Sovict intslligence services to CIA for checking as to\n[142]their accuracy.

The Warren Commission's Report on the assassination of\n[69]President Kennedy focused attention on the magnitude of the problem.\n[70]involved in the protection of the Chief Executive. As you know, it is\n[71]our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every\n[72]support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory\n[73]responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President\n[74]travels abroad,\n[76]2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission\n[77]produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem\n[78]of Presidential protection and on interagency operational cooperation,\n[79]which normally do not find their way into the public domain, These\n[80]include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation,\n[81]coordination, and operational interchanges, I believe you will be\n[82]interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren\n[83]Commission by U.S, intelligence and security officials. Pertinent\n[84]Fortions have been side lined. I commend these materials for reading\n[85]by all officers in positions of senior responsibility in headquarters and\n[86]overseas,\n[90]Document number 1 2% Bo. wunsVenn M, KNIGHT\n[92]Der D5IQ4S\n[93]for FOIA Review on SEP 876 460 e fe\n[95]“9 DATE TYPED DATE DISPATCHED\n[96]an eee | FEB coc\n[97]* a Wet\n[98]is we 23 Dec. 1964 @ FEB ig¢\n[99]]¢ROSS REFERENCE TO © DISPATCH SYMBOL AND NUMBER\n[101]|\n[102]|\n[103]Book Dispatch No, 4726\n[104]|\n[106]HEADQUARTERS FILE NUMBER\n[108]CLASSIFICATION eon\n[110]100-300-12 4\n[112]ORIG’ NATING ae pe\n[114]7) OFFICE — OFFICER ——~- TYPIST | Mt | oe)\n[116]CI/R&amp;A’ Raymond G, Rocca\n[117]COORDINATING\n[119]~R0oT Ing Sa sco Sire AEEERe WAM\n[120]j - Pra ml\n[121]j ; 2tD fay\n[122]oe\n[123]e&amp; ~ : (CE SYMBOL .\n[124]a Z/Ry0 oe —-\n[126]Tee\&quot; Seen tal ~~ (40) | HQ COPY | 7 ; S| P A T it Hl. ,\n[129]13-00000.\n[131]2\n[133]AF Division\n[135]Abidjan a\n[136]Accra “\n[137]Addis Ababa\n[139]“Algiers “\n[141]Bamako\n[142]Brazzaville”\n[144]Conakry o~\n[145]Dakar+~\n[147]Freetown—\n[152]Lagos —\n[154]Lome ,—-\n[155]Lusaka ¢~\n[157]Monrovia\n[158]Nairobi .~\n[161]Salisbury —~\n[163]Tripoliz-—\n[165]Tunis\n[167]a\n[168]Yaounde “x\n[170]The above listing has been\n[171]reviewed in the AF Division.\n[173]Lea\n[175](Initials)\n[177]D¢€ -ibution For -\n[178]Book Dispatch No. 4726.\n[180]EE Division\n[182]Athens ¢~\n[183]Bern —~\n[184]Frankfurt 2~\n[185]Nicosia ;\n[186]Vienna\n[188]The above listing has been\n[189]reviewed in the EE Division.\n[190]ny,\n[191]pet UO ~~-4\n[192](Initials)\n[194]FE Division\n[196]Bangkok ¢~\n[197]Djakarta -~\n[198]Hong Konge~\n[199]Honolulu\n[200]Kuala Lumpur:\n[201]Manila ~~\n[202]Melbourne\n[203]Okinawa - .\n[206]Saigon ~\n[207]Seoul -—~\n[208]Taipei\n[209]Tokyo\n[210]Vientiane —~\n[211]Wellington -~\n[213]The above listing has been\n[214]reviewed in Division.\n[216](Initials)\n[218]13-00000\n[220]S-E-G-R-E-?T\n[221]€ Distribution For\n[222]Book Dispatch No. 4726\n[223]NE Division WE Division\n[224]Aden.

Anthony,\n[5]° Regarding your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our\n[7]\&quot;records indicate~that. Valeriy Viadimixovich Kostikey\n[9]traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba\n[11]during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned\n[13]permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and\n[15]served there until August 1965. He was varigusly\n[17]described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache.\n[19]During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S.\n[21]Government employee assigned to our embassy in Mexico\n[23]City. >\n[25]Role -\n[27]In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswala~\n[29]approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt\n[31]to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR.\n[33]Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa\n[35]request. We have no information which indicates ‘any\n[37]relationship between these individuals other than for the\n[39]purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.\n[41]Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of\n[42]duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned\n[43]to the consular section and was a second secretary. It\n[44]appeared that he was tasked with following the activities\n[45]of the Central American communist parties.-dnd left-wing\n[46]groups, and he met often with members of these groups,\n[47]reportedly providing them with funds and technical\n[48]guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual\n[49]TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family\n[50]remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip\n[51]to Havana.\n[53]Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in\n[54]September 1971. Our information indicated that he was\n[55]not due to leave for another three to four months, and at\n[56]the time of his departure, there was some speculation that\n[57]the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that = ot\n[59]he was known to Lyalin.

He has been described as being without morals,\n[71]education, and manners. . Shortly after his arrival in\n[72]Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of\n[73]prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with\n[74]some locals. It appears this incident did not affect his\n[75]position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it\n[76]received a good deal of press coverage.\n[78]We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in\n[79]June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there\n[80]now.\n[82]Although our file indicates that Kostikev may have\n[83]been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action)\n[84](Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to\n[85]confirm this.

KOSTIKOV, born 17 March\n[12]1933, Moscow, was posted to Beirut in 1978 as lst Secretary and may still\n[13]be there. He is identified KGB and served in Mexico City from 1961-71.\n[14]There is a reference to him on page 307 of BARRON's KGB which suggests\n[15]that he may have been Department V. We do not appear to have asked LYALIN\n[16]about him, and are now doing so.\n[18]2. We also note that EPSTEIN in \&quot;Legend\&quot; claims that according to a CIA\n[19]telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City.\n[20]According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and\n[21]November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly\n[22]a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive.\n[24]3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious. As\n[25]you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in common with other Western Missions,\n[26]has been subject threats and violence in recent months, and in view of\n[27]earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records\n[29]of KGB staff in the area who might have been involved in promoting strong-arm\n[30]tactics.\n[32]4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to\n[33]be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and for\n[34]any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. In\n[35]particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that\n[36]KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Beirut or Damascus whose\n[37]‘trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse?\n[39]5. We should be grateful for an early reply and as I said on 6 May will treat\n[40]anything you can tell us on a strictly Service to Service basis.\n[42]COPY FOR\n[44]Gross FILE\n[45]201-¢). &amp;\n[46]DO NOT DESTROY\n[48]Yours ever\n[50]&amp; O ecko fo te 4 cg e G so\n[52]AE: waver\n[53]LOLA MS !\n[55]f eC\n[56]Sf foo De 4\n[58]Por FF 21S\n[60]p 4 7k sui @ inib nee\n[62]Noni fe? “ey 4)&quot;},&quot;Rejected&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[3]\n[6]6/705\n[9]VALERIY VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV— °\n[10]\n[17]\n[23]\n[28]\n[31]\n[38]\n[41]\n[43]\n[47]\n[49]\n[51]\n[54]\n[57]\n[59]\n[61]\n[63]\n[64]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;File&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;104-10012-10035.pdf&quot;},&quot;Accepted&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[1]DARAAN\n[2]\&quot;rod-t00%2“1o0as l 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F.

Mrs.\n[208]Besera Asenova, girl friend of Russian Consul came to my room and repeated that\n[209]Mr. Lee Harvey Cswald is assassin. He will kill President Kennedy.\n[211]On August 15, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the airport in embassy car, I told to\n[213]Mr. Blackshire, American Vice Consul, that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is aesissin.\n[215]He has a weapon or has ordered one. Mr. Blackshire said it seems like he will\n[217]kill someone. I said that Mr. Lee H. Oswald is preparing to kill President\n[219]of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Mr. Blackshire said where will it happen.\n[220]-1 said they (right wing) will invite President, criticize him in the newspaper, |\n[222]then kill him. Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegram to Pepartment\n[224]of State and he gave me the address where to report.\n[226]- At 9 asm. on August 19, 1963 in Washington, D.

(Mr. Jemes Earl Ray was in prison\n[241]at that time.) Director asked where assassination will happen. I said in Dallas, .\n[242]Texas. Director said if someone gave this information here I would expel the\n[244]man.

We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article ‘\&quot;A Reporter At Large:\n[25]Garrison\&quot;, published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by -\n[26]Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, (\&quot;Inquest\&quot;), critical of the\n[28]Warren Coumission Report.\n[30]2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S.,.most recently .\n[31]again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have\n[32]revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President\n[33]Kennedy, too. The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator\n[34]Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion- against.\n[35]the United States P claiming once more the existence of a sinister \&quot;political\n[36]murder conspiracy\&quot;. We are sending you the attached article--based either on\n[37]first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sources-=since it\n[38]deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison\n[40]: of New Orleans, La. That investigation tends to keep alive speculations about the\n[41]death of President Kennedy, an alleged \&quot;conspiracy\&quot;, and about the possible\n[42]involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA. .\n[44]3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forvarded\n[45]primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personne).\n[46]concerned. If the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the\n[47]context of renewed anti-U.S. attacks, you may use the article to brief interdsted.\n[48]contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to\n[49]assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard -- |\n[50]evidence of any such conspiracy.

HE DOES\n[54]NOT LIKE DRIVING AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN. IN CONTRAST WITH HIS\n[55]NORMALLY PLEASANT PERSONALITY, L/1 BECOMES AGGRESSIVE AND\n[56]NERVOUS BEHIND THE WHEEL.\n[58]WHILE FAMILIES WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN RATHER SMALL\n[60]BEACH HOUSE, L/1 AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO A FIGHT. SHE APPEARED\n[62]TO BE THE INSTIGATOR. F/86'S WIFE LATER TALKED TO L/1'S WIFE\n[64]IN PRIVATE. L/1’S WIFE SAID SHE BLAMES L/1 BECAUSE WHEN L/1 ‘\n[65]DIVORCED HIS PREVIOUS WIFE, HE GAVE HER HIS APARTMENT. THUS\n[67]L/1 AND HIS CURRENT WIFE WILL NOT HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE\n[69]WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CUBA. THAT IS WHY, DURING THEIR\n[71]PREVIOUS TRIP TO CUBA FROM URUGUAY, L/1 AND WIFE BUILT AN EXTRA\n[73]ROOM ONTO HOUSE OF MRS. L/1‘S PARENTS IN GUANABO.\n[75]MRS. L/1 ALSO SAID THAT L/1 IS \&quot;MUY CONSUMISTA\&quot; (I.E.,\n[77]A COMPULSIVE SHOPPER), AND THAT SHE HAS TO CONTROL HIM WHEN\n[78]THEY GO TO THE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE L/1 ALWAYS BUYS TOO MUCH.\n[79]MRS. L/1 EXPLAINED THAT L/1 GREW UP IN A VERY POOR FAMILY.\n[80]THAT IS WHY HE NOW BUYS TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING. SHE ALSO\n[82]SECREY\n[84]13-00000\n[86]‘SECRET\n[87]MHFNO: 94-5394206 SENSIND: PL PAGE: 2\n[88]CRITICIZED L/1 FOR SPOILING THEIR CHILDREN (HIS OLDER DAUGHTER\n[89]BY PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND THEIR YOUNGER DAUGHTER), BY GIVING\n[90]THEM WHATEVER THEY ASK FOR. MRS. L/1 HAS A POOR RELATIONSHIP\n[91]WITH THE OLDER DAUGHTER. SHE ADDED THAT L/1’S RELATIONSHIP\n[92]WITH HIS TWO GROWN SONS IS GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT DISTANT.\n[94]6. F/86 PERSONALLY OBSERVED L/1'S COMPULSIVE SHOPPING WHEN\n[95]THEY ALL WENT TO CHUY ON 8 JAN. BOTH L/1 AND HIS WIFE BOUGHT\n[96]LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS TO SEND TO THEIR FAMILY IN CUBA. AT ONE\n[97]POINT, L/i TOLD HIS WIFE. THAT HE WOULD DO THE BUYING AND SHE\n[98]SHOULD BE THE HOUSEWIFE. MRS. L/1 CALLED HIM A “DUMB SPANIARD\&quot;\n[99](\&quot;GALLEGO BRUTO\&quot;). F/86 SUSPECTS THAT L/1 AND WIFE HAVE OTHER\n[100]PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO L/1‘S INFIDELITY. DURING THEIR\n[101]SPATS, MRS. L/1 WAS USUALLY THE AGGRESSOR, WITH L/1 TRYING TO\n[102]KEEP PEACE OR SIMPLY REMAINING QUIET. MRS.. L/1 ALSO GOT INTO\n[103]ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PALESTINIAN MERCHANTS IN CHUY.\n[105]7. ONE OTHER ASPECT OF L/1'S FAMILY WHICH F/86 FOUND\n[106]DISAGREEABLE WAS BEHAVIOR OF L/1'S OLDER DAUGHTER. F/86 AND\n[107]HIS WIFE WERE BOTH OFFENDED BY DAUGHTER'S FREQUENT SEXUAL\n[108]REFERENCES IN FRONT OF F/86'S YOUNGER CHILDREN. F/86 SAID THAT\n[109]L/1‘S DAUGHTER ACTED JUST LIKE A CUBAN HOOKER.\n[111]8. ON A MORE ELEVATED PLANE, F/86 ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE\n[112]PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH L/1. IN RESPONSE\n[113]TO F/86‘S DIRECT QUESTION, L/1 SAID THAT THE WRITERS WHO HAVE\n[114]INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST ARE MARX, HEGEL AND KANT. L/1 SAID\n[115]THAT LENIN’S MAIN ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO RECOGNIZE NEED FOR ONLY\n[116]ONE PARTY. 1/1 CONSIDERS LENIN TO HAVE BEEN AN INTEPRETER OF\n[117]MARX BUT NOT A GREAT THEORETICIAN. TO SOME EXTENT, L/1\n[118]DEFENDED LENIN'S SO-CALLED \&quot;LAW OF ECONOMIC PRUDENCE\&quot;, A MEANS\n[119]OF ECONOMIC PLANNING WHICH LENIN UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO\n[120]IMPLEMENT IN USSR. AFTER LENIN’S DEATH, IT BECAME EXCESSIVELY\n[121]BUREAUCRATIZED AND ATROPHIED, ALTHOUGH THIS SYSTEM DID WORK\n[122]WITH SOME SUCCESS IN BULGARIA.\n[124]9. L/1 ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED NEED FOR \&quot;NEOLIBERAL MEDICINE\&quot; TO\n[125]REFORM CUBAN ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION. L/1\n[126]ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT REFORMS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED WITH MINIMUM\n[127]SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COSTS. WHILE STATE SHOULD NOT BE\n[128]EXCESSIVELY INTERVENTIONIST IN ECONOMY, L/1 WANTS STATE TO\n[129]RETAIN ITS PROTECTIVE SOCIAL ROLE, BECAUSE MARKET ECONOMY ALSO\n[130]HAS ITS FAULTS. ‘\n[132]10. L/i TALKED ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F.\n[133]KENNEDY. ACCORDING TO L/1, IN 1969, L/1 PERSONALLY SAW FIDEL\n[134]CASTRO RECEIVE A GROUP OF U.S. RADICALS. CASTRO TALKED TO THEM\n[135]FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT WHY JUST ONE ASSASSIN COULD NOT POSSIBLY\n[136]HAVE KILLED KENNEDY. CASTRO ORDERED A REENACTMENT OF THE\n[137]CRIME, USING HIS BEST MARKSMEN, AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE\n[139]*WHAT<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>SUPPOSEDLY DID BY HIMSELF. L/1 SAID\n[140]THAT THREE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN KILLING THE PRESIDENT: ONE\n[141]GROUP OF CUBANS, ONE GROUP O \&quot;MAFIOSOS\&quot; AND A THIRD GROUP OF\n[142]MERCENARIES. THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDED A MAN WITH A GREEK\n[143]NAME. L/1 TOLD F/86 THAT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER ANY OF THESE\n[145].

INTRODUCTION\n[30]The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-\n[31]terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent\n[32]information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying\n[33]subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for\n[34]producing lisits of .201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-\n[35]tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify\n[36]opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and\n[37]CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-\n[38]zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-\n[39]spondence has accumulated.\n[41]2. THE 201 SYSTEM\n[43]The principal features of the 201 system are: .\n[45]a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each\n[46]individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that |\n[47]’ individual.\n[49]__b. The 201 Dosster: the official file containing the 201 opening form: (Form |\n[50]831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i ie, per\n[51]sonal history, current status, and prospects. ae oe\n[53]” ro : The ‘Master 201 “Record: &amp; a machine ‘yebord Ginetited “by” the opening bof:\n[54]a 201 file. This record produces the master 20] reference for the Main Index and\n[56]stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings\n[58]d.

OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 ‘per- H\n[149]sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual\n[150]with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-\n[151]gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or\n[152]suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF\n[153]codes for use by components: .\n[155](1) general ol codes (Attachment 4)\n[157](2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services\n[158]or other specific organizations.\n[160]A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-\n[161]orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management\n[162]Officer.\n[164]A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OJ code may be assigned\n[166]paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added\n[167]ata later date by a Form 831 amendment.\n[169]The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201\n[170]personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the\n[171]security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members\n[172]of that service.\n[174]f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on\n[176]names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers\n[177]exist.\n[181]3.

Form 831 is also used to create or amend the\n[243]- master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the’ assign-\n[245]ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists .of sample\n[247]201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field —\n[248]J\&quot;station ‘may request the “Opening ‘of a 201. file’ ‘by writing 201- in the Head- > ~~\n[249]\&quot; quarters file or-cross-réference box on the -dispatch form and/or after’ the ~—\n[251]subject’s name in the body of the dispatch.

AMCARBON-2 pointed\n[148]out that in return.for this cooperation from the Identity 3,\n[149]_REUTEMAN had agreed that he would. be available for contact by\n[150]telephone or periodic personal meetings at which AMCAREBON-1\n[151]and AMCARBON~2 could discuss broad trends and developments in\n[152]Latin American affairs, AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON~1 that this\n[153]arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect to obtain\n[154]any classified information from REUTEMAN. The point was also\n[155]made that AMCARBON-1 should not press for the obtaining of\n[156]classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips\n[157]which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news storios,\n[158]ANCARBON~1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference\n[159]which had been outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference\n[160]has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship 5 with AMCAREON-1]\n[161]during the period December 1962 to March “1964,\n[163]| 3. AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CARSER, AMCARBON~1 originally\n[164]“gtarted to work for the Identity 3 in I957 on the City Desk,\n[165]and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment\n[166]which entailed covering major political developments in Florida.\n[167]At a later date, ANCARBON~1 became a feature writer for the\n[168]Identity 3. Then .in July or August 1962, ANCARBON~-] was made\n[169]' the Identity 4, This assignment was considered to be a significant\n[173]oo 7 y\n[175]Gi \\GSIFICATION = PAGE NO.\n[176]FORM ;\n[177]8. o0 S38a sae PaEvioUs EDITION. tl\n[178]ta SECRET CONTINUED 2.\n[181]13-00000\n[185]DISPATCH, * .\n[187]JFGA=-14781\n[189]promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by\n[190]the Identity 3 management. AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert\n[191]on Latin America, but he is developing his knowledge on the area\n[192]and, at the moment, he gives every indication of wanting to be a\n[193]long-term Latin American specialist. QDELF has been questioned\n[194]about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCAREON~1 is regarded\n[195]in the journalistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has\n[196]&amp; keen mind but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American\n[197]affaira, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse\n[198]of time, ANCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin\n[199]American specialists in U.S. journalistic circles, AMCARBON-~1\n[200]has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting\n[201]to improve his language fluency. It igs REUTEMAN's opinion that\n[202]‘AMCARBON=1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist,\n[203]and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact\n[204]who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing\n[205]in mind that he does have long~term potential, _\n[207]'4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping with the\n[208]traditional pattern of source protection which is common to —\n[209]newspapermen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers,\n[210]ANCARBON=-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his\n[211]sources, On the other hand, when pressed, ANCARBON-l1 has identified —\n[212]some of his sources to REUTEMAN, in order that meaningful evaluations\n[213]could be made of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to\n[214]KUBARK, As a result of these occasional witting identifications\n[215]of his sources, and, as. a result of general conversations with.\n[216]AMCARBON-1, REUTEMAN has learned that ANCARBON-1's sources include\n[217]the following persons: ‘\n[219]he _Liiis**#FERNANDEZ Rocha (201-316766),, secretary ‘general\n[220]of the DRE, 9: |. ;\n[222]b.

OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, On occasion, AMCARBON-1 is used\n[271]to carry out certain operational support tasks, In such instances,\n[272]AMCARBON-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action\n[273]within the context of his normal journalistic activities, The\n[275]use of ANCARBON=-1 for operational support tasks enables JNWAYE to\n[276]harness the investigative facilities of the Identity 3, -Several\n[277]uxamples of how AMCARBON=-1 has been used in operational support\n[278]tasks are outlined below: :\n[280]a a. ‘Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963, Andrew *ORDONO\n[281]Camps, DPOB 30 September 1914, Gibara, Cuba, A 12 837 G17, arrived\n[283]-in Miami and was given routine CAC processing, The details of this\n[284]processing are contained in MIAM-0085, dated 12 March 1963, After\n[285]being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3, and\n[287]a sensational story was developed, In view of this story, JMWAVE\n[288]tried to locate: ORDONO for debriefing. This effort was not productivd,\n[289]thus AMCARBON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO, AMCARBON~1 did locate\n[291]ORDONO in Houston, Texas. See WAVE-6307, dated 25 March 1963, for\n[292]details, 7\n[294]; b.: Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the HRR Splinter Group.\n[295]In UFGW-2555, dated 13 September 1963, Headquarters suggested that\n[296]JMWAVE might be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201~309611)\n[297]of the MRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims\n[298]relative to his faction invading Cuba, Headquarters' interest in\n[299]discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's\n[300]irresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY~1,\n[301]Ag'.a result of Headquarters’ interest in this matter, REUTEMAN had\n[302]a luncheon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which\n[303].AMCARBON~-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was.less\n[304]than accurate in .its claims relative to its activities in Cuba.\n[305]In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want\n[306]to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction\n[307]might release. AMCARBON-1 stated that, in view of REUTEMAN's\n[308]comments, the Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would\n[309]ignore the BANDIN faction in the future, Once BANDIN was discredited\n[310]with AMCARBON-1, the word was soon leaked by ANCARBON-1 to other\n[311]newspapermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source, As a result\n[312]-of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage\n[313]in South Florida since September 1963.\n[315]OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, In the period February 1963\n[316]_ to February 196%, ANCARBON~I has furnished JMWAVE with operational\n[317]intelligence as outlined below: _ ;\n[319]“sa, “In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, AMCARBON~1\n[320]reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was the object of\n[321].&amp; great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-1's release from\n[322]a Havana prison, ‘-AMCARBON-1 also indicated that AMBEND-1 would\n[323]probably be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the\n[324]UR in Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in\n[325]terms of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-1's movements, Subsequent\n[326]developments revealed that AMCAREON=-1 could not contact AMBEND-1,\n[327]and thus AMBEND-1's return to the United States did not cause the\n[328]publicity stir that was initially anticipated,\n[330]Lo . b. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON~1\n[331]reported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full\n[332]feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion.

AMCARBON~1 stated that, 1£ CARLSON were\n[351]of any current interest to REUTEMAN, then the Identity 3 would\n[353]soft peddle the CARLSON angle, REUTEMAN advised AMCARDON-1 that\n[355]be had no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and was of. the\n[356]Opinion that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney. The receipt\n[357]of this operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON\n[359]on the Identity.3's over-all interest in the role that CARLSON had\n[360]Played in the Bay of Pigs invasion. This briefing, in turn,\n[362]enabled CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting\n[363]with AMCARGON-1, . While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this\n[365]Bay of Pigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story.\n[366]was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish\n[367]his research, ....\n[369]c.. In- WAVE 0904, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-l advised\n[370]JMWAVE that Mr, Trevor *ARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the\n[371]Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting\n[372]to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic\n[373]missiles were hidden in Cuban caves. This information enabled\n[374]JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles\n[375]which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba,\n[377]<d, © In\&quot;WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-~2\n[378]gave JMWAVE his resume of the discussions which he had with\n[379]ANBIDDY~1 ‘atthe Miami Playboy Club on.19 September 1963. This .\n[380]information was ‘useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1\n[381]was telling. the press. — 4 ,\n[382]; . +, \&quot;@,3-Im WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON—1\n[383].reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with\n[384]| AMBIDDY-1's public relations man, This operational intelligence\n[385]was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-l1's\n[386]‘representatives were telling the outside world about their\n[387]operational activities, . .\n[389], £. In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-~1 |\n[390]informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were\n[391]being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK\n[392]vessels which were located in South Florida waters. This\n[394]. dnformation alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny wag\n[395]‘going to be directed toward the Identity 5. Armed with this warn-\n[396]ing, JMWAVE-was.able to take action which minimized the publicity\n[397]repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5,\n[399]g. In WAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1\n[400]reported to JMWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from\n[401]Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one\n[402]Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE,\n[403]Headquarters and the Lima Station. This examination revealed\n[404]that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no\n[405]real. operational potential in this lend, This incident did underscore |.\n[406]the fact that AMCARBON~-1 is willing to bring potentially significant q\n[407]operational leads to JMWAVE's attention,\n[409]h. In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1\n[410]advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls\n[411]indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had defected\n[413]* from.a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previousl\n[414]been seen in Miami during November or December 1963, At the same\n[415]time, AMCARGON~1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought\n[416]that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona\n[417]fide defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who\n[418]was being used as.a means of creating an incident which would\n[419]embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating\n[422]-S-E-G-R-~E_T. _ Kl CONTINUED\n[424]FORM ,\n[425]8:00 58a jue Previous EDITION.\n[428]13-00000\n[430]f\n[432]_” United States terractorial waters.

CONTINUED e\n[440]that KUBARK had played no role in mounting a provocation operation\n[441]against the GOC, At the same time, REUTEMAN pointed out that\n[443]it was highly unlikely that curroLA was a GOC agent, As a result\n[444]of this conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check\n[445]out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story, At the same time,\n[446]ANCARBON~l was prevailed upon not to write a story which might\n[447]lead the public to speculate on whether GUIROLA was an agent or a\n[448]plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC,\n[450]7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET, ABCARBON-1 has been used successfully,\n[451]during the period dovéered by this report, as a propaganda outlet\n[453]through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in\n[454]the free world press. Examples of how AMCARBON-~1 has been harnessed\n[456]in this field are outlined below: .\n[458], | AMCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally\n[459]surfaced in. the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de\n[460]las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo,\n[461]The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information.\n[462]relative to GOC activities in Uruguay. The story in the Diario\n[464]‘de las Americas had an extremely limited impact on Spanish readers\n[466]in the Minmi aren, As a result, it was decided to do a series\n[468]of feature stories on AMCRAB-], pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1 _\n[469]was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt\n[471]they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions\n[473]- of obscurity :once the revolution had put CASTRO in power. AMCARBON-]\n[475]was briefed in ‘detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an\n[477]- Opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 under controlled conditions in a\n[479]JMWAVE safehouse.. After completing his debriefing, ANCARDON-1\n[480]wrote a series of feature articles on ANCRAB-1, The first article\n[481]in the series received front page headline play, The series of\n[482]articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they provided an\n[484]‘excellent. peg for JMWAVE to mount a replay operation via other\n[486]propaganda assets. . ANCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-l was picked up\n[487]by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America.\n[488]The details of this surfacing can be found in WAVE 5826, dated\n[490]14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174,\n[491]dated 21 October 1963. ,\n[493]sO ’ pb, - Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat. Story. On 26 February 1964\n[494]JMWAVE learned that when Mr. Charles GRIFFIN’S sons went to Cuba\n[496]-to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that —\n[498]. select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over\n[500]to them, It was believed that this information would make a good\n[501]human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC\n[502]propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items\n[503]from.the Cuban fishing boats which had violated United States\n[504]territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was\n[505]given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in\n[507]Key West interview Mr, GRIFFIN. This interview was carried out,\n[508]and an article outlining the points which were of interest to\n[509]JMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the\n[510]Identity 3. .\n[512]c. LAYC Story, The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santingo,\n[513]Chile, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida\n[514]newspapers; as a result, REUTENAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March\n[515]1964 and suggested that the LAYC meeting was a story which the\n[516]Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON~1l was grateful for this steering\n[517]tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC\n[519]to one of the members of his staff. A story on the LAYC was .\n[520]subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 3\n[522](COMMENT: Copies of the articles cited in subparagraphs a through\n[524]c above are attached for Headquarters information, ) ee\n[527]13-00000\n[529]8. POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE, Attempts have been made to\n[531]obtain aisseminable positive Intelligence from: AMCARBON-1 during .\n[533]the period covered by this report, This attempt .has beon fenerally\n[535]unsuccessful, in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of\n[537]contacts in Latin America who would give him access to worthwhile\n[539]intelligence apprecinbly in advance of the information appearing\n[541]in the overt press, As a result, AMCARBON-~1 is usually not aware of\n[543]inside developments in any Latin * Amer ican country; consequently,\n[545]he is not a worthwhile source of positive intelligence, As a\n[547]matter of fact, AMCARBON-1 is less valuable as a source of positive\n[549]intelligence’. than’ most journalists, This is attributable solely\n[551]to bis lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica]\n[552]- speene, It is believed that AHCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome :\n[554]this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him far fF\n[556]the collection of positive intelligence, :\n[558]9, COMMENT. tn the period covered by this report, AMCARBON-1\n[559]has been Found to be a straight-forward individual who is honest,\n[560]cooperative and: who understands the need for security, Our\n[561]relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-1 is an accurate reporter\n[562]of that information which he passes to KUBARK, In view of this,\n[563]JMWAVE plans’ to:.continue to harness AMNCARBON~1 in the same manner\n[564]that he has been used in the past. It is believed that our rela-\n[565]tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our\n[566]operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, this relation-\n[567]ship tends to minimize the possibility that JBWAVE might have diffi-|\n[568]culties with .the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a\n[569]result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON-1, a special\n[570]activities report will be forwarded at appropriate intervals.\n[572]10, It. 418 yequested that a 201 number be assigned AMCARBON=1\n[573]and that TUM AYE ‘be advised of the number,\n[575]END OF DISPATCH\n[577]CLASSIFICATION\n[579]—SEORET\n[581]AM\n[582]2 53a 0s Uk PREVIOUS EDITION,\n[585]13-00000\n[587]ait . . ees mene\n[590]~~ SLABSIFICATION Die\n[592]i\n[593]i\n[594]i\n[595]i\n[596]1\n[598]. . . a _—— H SYMBOL AND NUMBER .\n[600]CL LUA LION OF - Separate Cover Attachmest |\n[601]m ti:\n[603]DISPATCH SECRET B to UFGA-14781 t\n[605]-\&quot;\\ yaentaties - 1 - Qhe Miami News:\n[607]2 ~®inland Training Center for\\\n[608]etarded Children\n[610]3 - fhe Wiami Herald\n[611]4 ~atin American Editor,\n[612]5 ~ The LEDA\n[614]DISTRIBUTION\n[615]3 - Chief,’ SAS |.\n[617]2 = RI.

[21]12 5 BARGE the 2 Av hese of €/SR and the DDP, I met with Mr. W.
[22]David ‘Slawson of tre staff of the President's Commission on the
[23]Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hours on tis date in
[24]the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington,
[25]D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies
[26]in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Departmers of
[27]State which were called to our attention in a lester from the General
[28]Counsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.
[30]on gtetions. a
[32]2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the ' -
[33]Commission's report that he vas writing, he sould have to deal with the :
[34]question of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! departure {rom the USSR = and
[35]‘the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or
[36]He expressed his belief that they probably sere
[37]not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn tne post-Stalinera. —
[39]However, he war.ted tu be sure in his own mir. that our information was
[40]not in conflict with that which the Commission: had received from State
[41]since all of that information wsuld remain in the records of the
[43]Commission.
[45]suspicious in any ‘ay.
[47]_ 3. After seating my belief that. there was no real disagreement yur
[48]inconsistency between the information from CLA ard that from State, I
[49]‘expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questiazs:
[51]- ; fa. Da the Soviet :

[56]jaw, a: Be ERNE

[60]a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet
[61]“citizens married tu forcign natignals to emigrate from the —
[62]Sovict Union to the homelands of their spouses? 7
[64]~ ‘b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to.
[65]accompany (i.e. depart'simultancously with) their spouses“.
[66]from the Soviet Union? . / Cre
[68]c. How long does it.take such Soviet citizens to get
[69]Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application
[70]to granting of visas)? : ,
[72]4. Concerning the first two questions (a and 3b above) I pointed out .
[74]_-_that we had addcessed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens
[75]being allowed to accompany their spsuses abroad while State dealt only
[77]with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being 2tiawed
[78]to emigrate without reference to whether or not they Ieft simultaneously
[79]with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented
[80]that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and
[82]State had said in that light.
[84]5. By way ar further explanation, I said that the statements in
[85]piragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being
[86]permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based ona
[87]review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only focr of
[88]these cascs did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of rer foreign
[89]husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the
[90]remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit u¢ to
[91]categorize them. I added that although State's information began by
[92]citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the
[93]American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December
[94]1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens
[95]who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed
[96]information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these
[97]whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.
[99]16, in response to
[101]13-00000
[103]J
[104]” 6, In response ty a question from Mr. Slawsaa I stated that most
[105]of the 26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign
[107]students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons,
[109]_ and while a number of cases have certain points is common, they bear
[110]‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who -
[111]‘married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April
[113]1964 memorandum to tre Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson
[115]‘indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter.
[117]“ 7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to
[119]process exit visas for Suvict citizens married to foreign nationals
[120](question 3c above), I stated that, in my upinion, the information
[121]provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's Ictter)
[122]substantially corresponded to the views expressed im paragraphs 6 and 7
[123]of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson
[124]asked if it would be pussitle to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum
[125]of 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our
[126]statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.
[128]8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion
[129]he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved.
[131]- However, he asked that «e send a brief written reply to the Commission's
[133]letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning
[134]the basis for staternents included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. [This
[135]would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed
[136]to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet
[138]visa applications. ]
[140]9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sendiing parts of his report
[141]dealing with the Sovict intslligence services to CIA for checking as to
[142]their accuracy. He did not say when this would occar. :
[144]10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I yead Volume 52
[145]of the transcript cf testimony before the Commissiom. Tis included the
[146]reinterview of Marina OSWALD. : :

[927]1, Paragraph.6,of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 wes a |
[929]ee |
[931]response to question. #3 of your. memorandum of 12 March 1964 extitied:
[933], Questions Posed by State Department Files. ' That question read as follows:
[934]. . 0 . . YY .
[935]“At the time that L.H, OSWALD and M. OSWALD Ic ~
[937]Russia for the United States was it legal and normal under Soviet law
[938]and practice for a Russian national married to an American to ve able
[940]to accompany him back to his honieland? Was the rapidity «ith which
[943]oor . an
[944]L. H! OSWALD waa able to accomplish this and Marina's return in :
[946]any way unusual? *
[948]” 2. Qur reply adreasca iteelf to the Legality and normality of Soviet
[949]citizens accompa aying ie. 3 departing simultaneously with) foreign spouses
[950]out of the USSR. It was based on a review of 26 casee, of which 16 involved
[951]Americans, in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens iz the USSR.
[952]In only four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Usnfon in the
[954]company of her-hueband. In one of these four cases, an Italiae Communist
[956]/ Party member married
[958]be ne ain
[960]13-00000
[962]"which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently
[964]. 6 April 1964. The material from Mr. Meeker provides useful additianal
[966]Party member married in the USSR and by prevatling upon the liallan Embaasy
[967]to hold up Itallan vieae for Soviet seamen, was able to arrange for hia wife to
[968]accompany him to Italy. In two more of the ‘cases, an American met his
[970]future wife ona visit bo the USSR, married her on'a subsequent trip, and -
[972]brought her back to the U.S. No detaiis are available on the fourth case,
[974]“a
[976]brought her out with him.
[980]“3. In 14 of the remaining cases, a foreign husband (in one case a wife)
[981]t
[982]departed alone, In another case the wife preceded her huskand because he
[983]had been fafled a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations
[985]and in 7 additional cases the sequence {a not known, .
[986]4. The information in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter
[988]regarding length of dme taken by Soviet authorities to process visa applications
[989]_
[991]of Soviet wives of American citizens substantially corresponds with the |
[993]conclusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of our tnemorandum of
[995]data

[58]Chief, KUDOVE RORY MICROFILM ;
[60]SUBJECT
[62]© Warren Commission Testimony - Selected Excerpts _
[64]ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
[66]FYI...
[68]1. The Warren Commission's Report on the assassination of
[69]President Kennedy focused attention on the magnitude of the problem.
[70]involved in the protection of the Chief Executive. As you know, it is
[71]our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every
[72]support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory
[73]responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President
[74]travels abroad,
[76]2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission
[77]produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem
[78]of Presidential protection and on interagency operational cooperation,
[79]which normally do not find their way into the public domain, These
[80]include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation,
[81]coordination, and operational interchanges, I believe you will be
[82]interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren
[83]Commission by U.S, intelligence and security officials. Pertinent
[84]Fortions have been side lined. I commend these materials for reading
[85]by all officers in positions of senior responsibility in headquarters and
[86]overseas,

[4]Dear. Anthony,
[5]° Regarding your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our
[7]"records indicate~that. Valeriy Viadimixovich Kostikey
[9]traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba
[11]during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned
[13]permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and
[15]served there until August 1965. He was varigusly
[17]described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache.
[19]During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S.
[21]Government employee assigned to our embassy in Mexico
[23]City. >
[25]Role -
[27]In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswala~
[29]approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt
[31]to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR.
[33]Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa
[35]request. We have no information which indicates ‘any
[37]relationship between these individuals other than for the
[39]purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.
[41]Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of
[42]duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned
[43]to the consular section and was a second secretary. It
[44]appeared that he was tasked with following the activities
[45]of the Central American communist parties.-dnd left-wing
[46]groups, and he met often with members of these groups,
[47]reportedly providing them with funds and technical
[48]guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual
[49]TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family
[50]remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip
[51]to Havana.
[53]Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in
[54]September 1971. Our information indicated that he was
[55]not due to leave for another three to four months, and at
[56]the time of his departure, there was some speculation that
[57]the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that = ot
[59]he was known to Lyalin. Ygo- @P— ve ST
[61]CROSS FILE COPY FOR
[63]DO NOT DESTROY
[65]D26/- 30505 2
[68]While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the
[69]mont effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in
[70]Mexico. He has been described as being without morals,
[71]education, and manners. . Shortly after his arrival in
[72]Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of
[73]prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with
[74]some locals. It appears this incident did not affect his
[75]position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it
[76]received a good deal of press coverage.
[78]We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in
[79]June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there
[80]now.
[82]Although our file indicates that Kostikev may have
[83]been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action)
[84](Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to
[85]confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB
[86]has not engaged in such executive action since 1959.

[7]10 May 1982
[8]0 Dear “Dass I
[11]1. Please refer to our conversation of 6 May. KOSTIKOV, born 17 March
[12]1933, Moscow, was posted to Beirut in 1978 as lst Secretary and may still
[13]be there. He is identified KGB and served in Mexico City from 1961-71.
[14]There is a reference to him on page 307 of BARRON's KGB which suggests
[15]that he may have been Department V. We do not appear to have asked LYALIN
[16]about him, and are now doing so.
[18]2. We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that according to a CIA
[19]telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City.
[20]According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and
[21]November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly
[22]a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive.
[24]3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious. As
[25]you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in common with other Western Missions,
[26]has been subject threats and violence in recent months, and in view of
[27]earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records
[29]of KGB staff in the area who might have been involved in promoting strong-arm
[30]tactics.
[32]4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to
[33]be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and for
[34]any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. In
[35]particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that
[36]KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Beirut or Damascus whose
[37]‘trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse?
[39]5. We should be grateful for an early reply and as I said on 6 May will treat
[40]anything you can tell us on a strictly Service to Service basis.

[200]Washington, D. C. | , ;
[202]Dear Sir:
[204]Mr. Wasilev Consul gave me order to transmit this information to U. S. Government,
[206]"on August 9, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria. ~Mr. Wasilev, Consul of Embassy of U.S.S.R.,
[207]gave me this information about Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald on August 14, 1963. Mrs.
[208]Besera Asenova, girl friend of Russian Consul came to my room and repeated that
[209]Mr. Lee Harvey Cswald is assassin. He will kill President Kennedy.
[211]On August 15, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the airport in embassy car, I told to
[213]Mr. Blackshire, American Vice Consul, that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is aesissin.
[215]He has a weapon or has ordered one. Mr. Blackshire said it seems like he will
[217]kill someone. I said that Mr. Lee H. Oswald is preparing to kill President
[219]of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Mr. Blackshire said where will it happen.
[220]-1 said they (right wing) will invite President, criticize him in the newspaper, |
[222]then kill him. Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegram to Pepartment
[224]of State and he gave me the address where to report.
[226]- At 9 asm. on August 19, 1963 in Washington, D. C., I went to see (Mr. Kippingan).
[227]Director of Special Counselor Service Department of State at 1901 Pennsylvania

[229]Kennedy. The Director said do not mention name of President Kennedy, only
[230]respond to the questions. -The Director said tell us what will tappen to Mr.
[232]Lee Harvey Oswald then. I said Mr. Lee H. Oswald will be killed after kill
[233]Kennedy. I said I will take the truth drug to tell the truth. Director tell

[241]at that time.) Director asked where assassination will happen. I said in Dallas, .
[242]Texas. Director said if someone gave this information here I would expel the
[244]man. Director did call on F.B.I. agents after FeBele use anesthesia gas to
[246]freeze me to drub me to keep amnesia.

[18]Warren Commission Report: Article on the Investigatian | Conducted by
[19]District Attorney Garrison
[24]1. We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article ‘"A Reporter At Large:
[25]Garrison", published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by -
[26]Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, ("Inquest"), critical of the
[28]Warren Coumission Report.
[30]2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S.,.most recently .
[31]again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have
[32]revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President
[33]Kennedy, too. The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator
[34]Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion- against.
[35]the United States P claiming once more the existence of a sinister "political
[36]murder conspiracy". We are sending you the attached article--based either on
[37]first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sources-=since it
[38]deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison
[40]: of New Orleans, La. That investigation tends to keep alive speculations about the
[41]death of President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible
[42]involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA. .
[44]3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forvarded
[45]primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personne).
[46]concerned. If the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the
[47]context of renewed anti-U.S. attacks, you may use the article to brief interdsted.
[48]contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to
[49]assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard -- |
[50]evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets may have to explain to
[52]. their audiences certain basic facts about the U.S. judicial system, its separation
[53]of state and federal courts and the fact that judges and district attorneys in the
[54]states are usually elected, not appointed: consequently, D.A. Garrison can continue
[55]in office as long as his constituents re-elect him. Even if your assets have to
[56]discuss this in order to refute--or at least weaken--anti-U.8. propaganda of - .
[57]sufficiently serious mpacts any personal attacks upon Garrison (or any other. ‘public
[58]personality in the U.S 2° be strictly avoided.

[49]1N 1976 AT MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY WHILE A FULBRIGHT
[50]PROFESSOR. NIKONOV WAS REGARDED AS EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT AND
[51]CAPABLE BUT GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS AN IDEOLOGICAL
[52]HAROLINER. THE PROFESSOR BELIEVED THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO BE A
[53]RISING STAR IN THE SOVIET SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDED HIM FOR AN

[100]DETERMINE IF LEE HARVEY ((OSWALD)) HAD BEEN A KGB AGENT. HE
[101]REVIEWED FIVE THICK VOLUMES OF FILES GN OSWALD. NIKONCV IS ‘GW
[102]CONFIOENT THAT ZSWALO WAS AT NO TIME AN AGENT CONTROLLES BY THE
[103]KGB. FROM THE GESCRIPTION OF OSWALD IN THE FILES HE DOUBTED
[104]THAT ANYONE COULD CONTROL OSWALD, BUT NOTED THAT THE KBG
[105]WATCHEO HIM CLOSE.Y ANC CONSTANTLY WHILE HE WAS IN THE USSR.
[107]HE COMMENTED THAT OSWALD HAD A STORMY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS
[108]SOVIET WIFE, WHO RODE HIM iNCESSANTLY. THE FILE ALSO REFLECTES
[109]THAT OSWA.D WAS A POCR SHCT WHEN HE TRIEO TARGET FIRING IN THE

[113]RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SWEDISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, NIKONGV
[114]PERSONALLY PERFORMED AN INQUIRY FOR BAKATIN INTO THE FATE OF
[115]SWEDISH DIPLOMAT RAOUL ((WALLENSERG)). THERE 1S STILL PRESSURE |
[116]FROM THE SWEDISH SIDE TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THIS
[117]MATTER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING {IMPORTANCE OF THE WALLENBERG
[118]FAMILY. NIKONOV WAS AMAZED TO FIND OUT THAT THE KG3 HAD NOT {
[119],BEEN ABLE TO PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISH WHETHER WALLENBERG HAD OIEO
[120]AND UNOER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE WAS ABLE TO FIND PARTIAL
[121]EVIDENCE FROM FOURTEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES (NF:). NIXONOV NOW
[122]BELIEVES, BUT FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE PROOF, THAT WALLENBERG WAS
[123]EXECUTED LATE IN 1947. THERE WERE INCICATIONS THAT WALLENBERS
[124]WAS SUSPECTEC OF HAVING CONTACTS WITH OTHERS WHO WERE ACCUSED
[125]OF PROVIDING FALSE OIPLOMATIC IDENTITY COCUMENTS TO OTHERS
[126]BEYOND JEWS SAVEO FROM THE HOLOCAUST. . AMONG THESE WERE NAZI
[127]WAR CRIMINALS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE. THERE WAS NO PROCF
[128]OF WALLENSERG'S GUILT IN ANY OF THESE CHARGES.

[76]DEAR BOB:
[78]IN NOVEMBER 1980, I SABOTAGED THE DENVER MAGAZINE
[79]*ARTICLE, "FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE&lt;ASSASSINATION>TRAIL", BECAUSE
[80]THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION I WAS GIVING TO THE MAGAZINE, TO
[81]VERIFY CERTAIN EVENTS I ALLEGED, WAS BEING GIVEN TO THE DENVER

[85]BOXES OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, PICTURES, NAMES AND

[87]EDITOR, PETER BOYLES, WRITER, DOUGH VAUGHN, RESEARCHER. FROM
[88]THESE DOCUMENTS, DOUGH VAUGHN, AND OTHERS, USED THE DOCUMENTS,
[89]AND MY STATEMENTS, TO VERIFY THE FACT SHEET THAT IS CONTAIN
[90]WITHIN THE ARTICLE.
[92]THE (NVTAG) CAME TO MY PLACE BEFORE THE ARTICLE WAS
[93]PUBLISHED AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT “INCRIMINATING” STATEMENTS I
[94]HAD MADE TO DENVER MAGAZINE. SHORTLY AFTER THAT I CHANGED NAMES
[95]AND DATES IN THE ARTICLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT THE ARTICLE
[96]AND MYSELF. I DID NOT WANT TO BE PART OF ANY GOVERNMENT PROBE
[97]INTO MY PAST ACTIVITIES IN BEHALF OF THE (NWBOLTON) AND THE

[100]I NEVER SAW THE ARTICLE BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED....,
[101]NEVER WANTED TO, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE MEETING WITH THE (NVTAG)

[106]IN EVERGREEN COLORADO (WITNESSES AND POLICE REPORTS ON FILE AS
[107]WHE EVENT TOOK PLACE IN AUGUST OF 81)
[109]I MADE PEACE WITH MY ENEMIES AND WENT BACK TO WORK AS A

[111]*TIMES TO THE SENATE AND THE CONGRESS. THE&lt;KENNEDY>MATTER IS
[112]CONTAINED WITHIN THAT TESTIMONY, AS WELL AS THE BOYLE ARTICLE.
[113]THAT TESTIMONY IS CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET, COMMITTEE SENSITIVE, -

[116]SOMEDAY IT WILL BE DECLASSIFIED AND THEN I’LL TALK SOME

[40]MONTEVIDEO 66777 94 5389683
[42]ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE PASS TO NOC SIDNEY B.
[44]CALLICRATE PRIOR TO HIS TDY DEPARTURE TO MONTEVIDEO.
[46]SUMMARY: THIS CABLE CONTAINS ASSESSMENT DATA FROM
[48]FGFORK/86 (F/86) ON SLLARCENY/1 (L/1), BASED ON F/86’'S
[49]OBSERVATIONS OF, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH, L/1 AND FAMILY DURING
[50]THEIR REF OUTING TO CHUY IN EARLY JAN 94.
[52]L/1 DID THE DRIVING FROM MONTEVIDEO TO CHUY. HE DOES
[54]NOT LIKE DRIVING AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN. IN CONTRAST WITH HIS
[55]NORMALLY PLEASANT PERSONALITY, L/1 BECOMES AGGRESSIVE AND
[56]NERVOUS BEHIND THE WHEEL.
[58]WHILE FAMILIES WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN RATHER SMALL
[60]BEACH HOUSE, L/1 AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO A FIGHT. SHE APPEARED
[62]TO BE THE INSTIGATOR. F/86'S WIFE LATER TALKED TO L/1'S WIFE
[64]IN PRIVATE. L/1’S WIFE SAID SHE BLAMES L/1 BECAUSE WHEN L/1 ‘
[65]DIVORCED HIS PREVIOUS WIFE, HE GAVE HER HIS APARTMENT. THUS
[67]L/1 AND HIS CURRENT WIFE WILL NOT HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE
[69]WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CUBA. THAT IS WHY, DURING THEIR
[71]PREVIOUS TRIP TO CUBA FROM URUGUAY, L/1 AND WIFE BUILT AN EXTRA
[73]ROOM ONTO HOUSE OF MRS. L/1‘S PARENTS IN GUANABO.
[75]MRS. L/1 ALSO SAID THAT L/1 IS "MUY CONSUMISTA" (I.E.,
[77]A COMPULSIVE SHOPPER), AND THAT SHE HAS TO CONTROL HIM WHEN
[78]THEY GO TO THE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE L/1 ALWAYS BUYS TOO MUCH.
[79]MRS. L/1 EXPLAINED THAT L/1 GREW UP IN A VERY POOR FAMILY.
[80]THAT IS WHY HE NOW BUYS TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING. SHE ALSO
[82]SECREY
[84]13-00000
[86]‘SECRET
[87]MHFNO: 94-5394206 SENSIND: PL PAGE: 2
[88]CRITICIZED L/1 FOR SPOILING THEIR CHILDREN (HIS OLDER DAUGHTER
[89]BY PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND THEIR YOUNGER DAUGHTER), BY GIVING
[90]THEM WHATEVER THEY ASK FOR. MRS. L/1 HAS A POOR RELATIONSHIP
[91]WITH THE OLDER DAUGHTER. SHE ADDED THAT L/1’S RELATIONSHIP
[92]WITH HIS TWO GROWN SONS IS GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT DISTANT.
[94]6. F/86 PERSONALLY OBSERVED L/1'S COMPULSIVE SHOPPING WHEN
[95]THEY ALL WENT TO CHUY ON 8 JAN. BOTH L/1 AND HIS WIFE BOUGHT
[96]LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS TO SEND TO THEIR FAMILY IN CUBA. AT ONE
[97]POINT, L/i TOLD HIS WIFE. THAT HE WOULD DO THE BUYING AND SHE
[98]SHOULD BE THE HOUSEWIFE. MRS. L/1 CALLED HIM A “DUMB SPANIARD"
[99]("GALLEGO BRUTO"). F/86 SUSPECTS THAT L/1 AND WIFE HAVE OTHER
[100]PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO L/1‘S INFIDELITY. DURING THEIR
[101]SPATS, MRS. L/1 WAS USUALLY THE AGGRESSOR, WITH L/1 TRYING TO
[102]KEEP PEACE OR SIMPLY REMAINING QUIET. MRS.. L/1 ALSO GOT INTO
[103]ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PALESTINIAN MERCHANTS IN CHUY.
[105]7. ONE OTHER ASPECT OF L/1'S FAMILY WHICH F/86 FOUND
[106]DISAGREEABLE WAS BEHAVIOR OF L/1'S OLDER DAUGHTER. F/86 AND
[107]HIS WIFE WERE BOTH OFFENDED BY DAUGHTER'S FREQUENT SEXUAL
[108]REFERENCES IN FRONT OF F/86'S YOUNGER CHILDREN. F/86 SAID THAT
[109]L/1‘S DAUGHTER ACTED JUST LIKE A CUBAN HOOKER.
[111]8. ON A MORE ELEVATED PLANE, F/86 ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE
[112]PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH L/1. IN RESPONSE
[113]TO F/86‘S DIRECT QUESTION, L/1 SAID THAT THE WRITERS WHO HAVE
[114]INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST ARE MARX, HEGEL AND KANT. L/1 SAID
[115]THAT LENIN’S MAIN ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO RECOGNIZE NEED FOR ONLY
[116]ONE PARTY. 1/1 CONSIDERS LENIN TO HAVE BEEN AN INTEPRETER OF
[117]MARX BUT NOT A GREAT THEORETICIAN. TO SOME EXTENT, L/1
[118]DEFENDED LENIN'S SO-CALLED "LAW OF ECONOMIC PRUDENCE", A MEANS
[119]OF ECONOMIC PLANNING WHICH LENIN UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO
[120]IMPLEMENT IN USSR. AFTER LENIN’S DEATH, IT BECAME EXCESSIVELY
[121]BUREAUCRATIZED AND ATROPHIED, ALTHOUGH THIS SYSTEM DID WORK
[122]WITH SOME SUCCESS IN BULGARIA.
[124]9. L/1 ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED NEED FOR "NEOLIBERAL MEDICINE" TO
[125]REFORM CUBAN ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION. L/1
[126]ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT REFORMS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED WITH MINIMUM
[127]SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COSTS. WHILE STATE SHOULD NOT BE
[128]EXCESSIVELY INTERVENTIONIST IN ECONOMY, L/1 WANTS STATE TO
[129]RETAIN ITS PROTECTIVE SOCIAL ROLE, BECAUSE MARKET ECONOMY ALSO
[130]HAS ITS FAULTS. ‘
[132]10. L/i TALKED ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F.
[133]KENNEDY. ACCORDING TO L/1, IN 1969, L/1 PERSONALLY SAW FIDEL
[134]CASTRO RECEIVE A GROUP OF U.S. RADICALS. CASTRO TALKED TO THEM
[135]FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT WHY JUST ONE ASSASSIN COULD NOT POSSIBLY
[136]HAVE KILLED KENNEDY. CASTRO ORDERED A REENACTMENT OF THE
[137]CRIME, USING HIS BEST MARKSMEN, AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE
[139]*WHAT&lt;LEE HARVEY OSWALD>SUPPOSEDLY DID BY HIMSELF. L/1 SAID
[140]THAT THREE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN KILLING THE PRESIDENT: ONE
[141]GROUP OF CUBANS, ONE GROUP O "MAFIOSOS" AND A THIRD GROUP OF
[142]MERCENARIES. THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDED A MAN WITH A GREEK
[143]NAME. L/1 TOLD F/86 THAT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER ANY OF THESE

[24]THE 201: SYSTEM Pro, lly
[26]Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I, 27 October 1966
[28]1. INTRODUCTION
[30]The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
[31]terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
[32]information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
[33]subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
[34]producing lisits of .201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
[35]tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
[36]opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
[37]CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
[38]zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
[39]spondence has accumulated.
[41]2. THE 201 SYSTEM
[43]The principal features of the 201 system are: .
[45]a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
[46]individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that |
[47]’ individual.
[49]__b. The 201 Dosster: the official file containing the 201 opening form: (Form |
[50]831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i ie, per
[51]sonal history, current status, and prospects. ae oe
[53]” ro : The ‘Master 201 “Record: &amp; a machine ‘yebord Ginetited “by” the opening bof:
[54]a 201 file. This record produces the master 20] reference for the Main Index and
[56]stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings

[148]e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 ‘per- H
[149]sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
[150]with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
[151]gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
[152]suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF
[153]codes for use by components: .
[155](1) general ol codes (Attachment 4)
[157](2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
[158]or other specific organizations.
[160]A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
[161]orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
[162]Officer.
[164]A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OJ code may be assigned
[166]paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
[167]ata later date by a Form 831 amendment.
[169]The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
[170]personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
[171]security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
[172]of that service.
[174]f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
[176]names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
[177]exist.
[181]3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
[182]a. General . ae
[183]The opening of a 201 dossier is the .prerogative- of an operational ‘com--
[185]a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional -closing._ . ;

[192]sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those | ot.
[193]persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals ‘. os ;

[208]and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
[209]records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
[211]ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings én certain categories of persons whose .
[213]names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201
[214]dossiers should be opened in the following categories: Loe
[216](1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
[218]proval requests, However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
[219]for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
[220]tional interest for training purposes only.
[222](2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

[239]Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
[240]a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
[241]tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
[243]- master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the’ assign-
[245]ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists .of sample
[247]201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field —
[248]J"station ‘may request the “Opening ‘of a 201. file’ ‘by writing 201- in the Head- > ~~
[249]" quarters file or-cross-réference box on the -dispatch form and/or after’ the ~—
[251]subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for é a 201 opening
[252]is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
[253]placing 201- after’ the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. -IP/AN
[255]will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi- —
[256]bility of the desk to‘respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
[258]201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

[336]a "Purging aa
[338]Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
[339]discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
[340]simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
[341]place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
[342]periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
[343]be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: ~ ,
[345](1) Duplicate material, Le., exact copy(s) of a document.
[347](2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
[348]the opening.
[350](3) All abstract slips.
[351](4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).
[353](5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
[354]a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
[355]then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.
[357](6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets ( Form 610) and dispatch
[358]cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.
[360](7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information

[365]forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention _
[366]in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
[367]officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
[368]over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret. classification. -
[369]authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained’

[29]a 2 INTRODUCTION, In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review
[30]of the nature of its relationship with ’ AMCARBON~2 This review
[31]indicates that the relationship with AMNCARBON-2 evolved from that
[32]action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security
[33]breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was
[34]being carried out by the Identity 1 relative to the fact that the
[35]establishment .of the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT
[36]South Campus as a: result of security restrictions which. were in some
[37]way,related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARDON-2
[38]stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis
[39]situation, the establishment of a working relationship with the
[40]Identity 3 was on objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain,
[41]As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made
[42]that JMWAVE be given. approval to contact the major South Florida
[43]news media in an attempt to work out a relationship with these new:
[44]media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity
[45]spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might
[47]_ come to their attention, Thus, when a relationship was established
[48]with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE
[49]might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of
[50]achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3,
[51]which would simultaneously insure the security of JNWAVE's operations
[52]and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for
[53]_ surfacing certain select: propaganda items. In the period October to

[100]December 1962, al1 of JMWAVE's business with the Identity 3
[102]was handled via ANCARDON-2 In mid-December 1962, AMCARRON-2
[104]\ made the suggestion that introduce REUTEMAN to * AMCARDON-1
[106]; in order that there be a backup contact, in the evont that
[108]: ANCAREBON=~2 were out of to or unavailable at such times as
[110]; REUTEMAN might require assiistance from the Identity 3, REUTEMAN
[112]: agreed to AMCARBON-2's suggestion, and, as a result, AMCARDON-2
[114]; hosted a luncheon on 12 December joez a at the Miami Club in the
[115]Hotel Columbus, Miami, Florida, at which AMCARBON-2 introduced
[116]AMCARBON=-1 to REUTEMAN, As a result of this initial meeting on
[117]12 December 1962, an operational relntionship has developed with
[118]AMCARBON=1, and it is believed that this relationship contributes ,
[119]‘to the fulfillment of the over~all JMWAVE mission, In view of
[120]this, a apecial activities report is being submitted to cover the
[121]nature of JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON-1 during the
[122]period December. 1962 to March 1964,°
[124]2. "FRAME: or REFERENCE FOR JHWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCAR 2BON =I
[125]When AMCARBON-2 introduced All CON-T to REUTEMAN, ANCARLON=
[126]reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating
[127]with REUTEMAN,:.This review was conducted for AMCARBON~1's
[128]benefit, in” order that he might clearly understand the frame of
[129]reference, which should prevail in his relationships with REUTEMAN,
[130]‘In this review, AMCAREON-2 pointed out that it was the policy
[131].of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would
[132]purposely embarxass KUBARK or its South Florida operations, As
[133].@ result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations
[134]-4n South Florida: did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this
[135]material would’ be brought to REUTEMAN's immediate attention,
[136]AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON=-1 that such items should be
[137]discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner, In addition, AMNCARGUN-2
[138]made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1
[139]’. should follow REUTEMAN's guidance relative to how any particularly
[140]embarrassing item might be handled by the Identity 3, so that it
[141]would not expose KUBARK operations and, at the same Lime, would
[142]not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3,
[143]In addition, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that, if ANCARBON—1 brought
[144]a potentially embarrassing item to REUTEMAN's attention and
[145]remedial action ‘on the matter was not taken, by REUTEMAN within
[146]a reasonable period of time, then thé Identity 3 would feel free
[147]to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part. AMCARBON-2 pointed
[148]out that in return.for this cooperation from the Identity 3,
[149]_REUTEMAN had agreed that he would. be available for contact by
[150]telephone or periodic personal meetings at which AMCAREBON-1
[151]and AMCARBON~2 could discuss broad trends and developments in
[152]Latin American affairs, AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON~1 that this
[153]arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect to obtain
[154]any classified information from REUTEMAN. The point was also
[155]made that AMCARBON-1 should not press for the obtaining of
[156]classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips
[157]which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news storios,
[158]ANCARBON~1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference
[159]which had been outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference
[160]has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship 5 with AMCAREON-1]
[161]during the period December 1962 to March “1964,
[163]| 3. AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CARSER, AMCARBON~1 originally
[164]“gtarted to work for the Identity 3 in I957 on the City Desk,
[165]and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment
[166]which entailed covering major political developments in Florida.
[167]At a later date, ANCARBON~1 became a feature writer for the
[168]Identity 3. Then .in July or August 1962, ANCARBON~-] was made
[169]' the Identity 4, This assignment was considered to be a significant

[189]promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by
[190]the Identity 3 management. AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert
[191]on Latin America, but he is developing his knowledge on the area
[192]and, at the moment, he gives every indication of wanting to be a
[193]long-term Latin American specialist. QDELF has been questioned
[194]about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCAREON~1 is regarded
[195]in the journalistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has
[196]&amp; keen mind but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American
[197]affaira, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse
[198]of time, ANCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin
[199]American specialists in U.S. journalistic circles, AMCARBON-~1
[200]has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting
[201]to improve his language fluency. It igs REUTEMAN's opinion that
[202]‘AMCARBON=1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist,
[203]and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact
[204]who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing
[205]in mind that he does have long~term potential, _
[207]'4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping with the
[208]traditional pattern of source protection which is common to —
[209]newspapermen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers,
[210]ANCARBON=-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his
[211]sources, On the other hand, when pressed, ANCARBON-l1 has identified —
[212]some of his sources to REUTEMAN, in order that meaningful evaluations
[213]could be made of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to
[214]KUBARK, As a result of these occasional witting identifications
[215]of his sources, and, as. a result of general conversations with.
[216]AMCARBON-1, REUTEMAN has learned that ANCARBON-1's sources include
[217]the following persons: ‘

[220]of the DRE, 9: |. ;

[229]e. Aureliano *SANCHEZ Arango (201-019245), leader of the AAA
[231]-' . £, - Edmund #LEAHY of the Washington News Bureau. AMCARBON-1
[233]regards this source as being particularly interesting, in view
[235]of the fact that LEAHY's daughter is a secretary in the office of
[236]Attorney General Robert KENNEDY.

[253]“USITA in Miami, AMCARBON-1 is well aware of the fact that VOLSKY

[255]does not deter AMCARBON-1 from attempting to exploit VOLSKY as a

[269]. 5. OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, On occasion, AMCARBON-1 is used
[271]to carry out certain operational support tasks, In such instances,
[272]AMCARBON-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action
[273]within the context of his normal journalistic activities, The
[275]use of ANCARBON=-1 for operational support tasks enables JNWAYE to
[276]harness the investigative facilities of the Identity 3, -Several
[277]uxamples of how AMCARBON=-1 has been used in operational support
[278]tasks are outlined below: :
[280]a a. ‘Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963, Andrew *ORDONO
[281]Camps, DPOB 30 September 1914, Gibara, Cuba, A 12 837 G17, arrived
[283]-in Miami and was given routine CAC processing, The details of this
[284]processing are contained in MIAM-0085, dated 12 March 1963, After
[285]being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3, and
[287]a sensational story was developed, In view of this story, JMWAVE
[288]tried to locate: ORDONO for debriefing. This effort was not productivd,
[289]thus AMCARBON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO, AMCARBON~1 did locate
[291]ORDONO in Houston, Texas. See WAVE-6307, dated 25 March 1963, for
[292]details, 7
[294]; b.: Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the HRR Splinter Group.
[295]In UFGW-2555, dated 13 September 1963, Headquarters suggested that
[296]JMWAVE might be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201~309611)
[297]of the MRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims
[298]relative to his faction invading Cuba, Headquarters' interest in
[299]discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's
[300]irresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY~1,
[301]Ag'.a result of Headquarters’ interest in this matter, REUTEMAN had
[302]a luncheon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which
[303].AMCARBON~-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was.less
[304]than accurate in .its claims relative to its activities in Cuba.
[305]In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want
[306]to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction
[307]might release. AMCARBON-1 stated that, in view of REUTEMAN's
[308]comments, the Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would
[309]ignore the BANDIN faction in the future, Once BANDIN was discredited
[310]with AMCARBON-1, the word was soon leaked by ANCARBON-1 to other
[311]newspapermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source, As a result
[312]-of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage
[313]in South Florida since September 1963.
[315]OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, In the period February 1963
[316]_ to February 196%, ANCARBON~I has furnished JMWAVE with operational
[317]intelligence as outlined below: _ ;
[319]“sa, “In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, AMCARBON~1
[320]reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was the object of
[321].&amp; great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-1's release from
[322]a Havana prison, ‘-AMCARBON-1 also indicated that AMBEND-1 would
[323]probably be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the
[324]UR in Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in
[325]terms of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-1's movements, Subsequent
[326]developments revealed that AMCAREON=-1 could not contact AMBEND-1,
[327]and thus AMBEND-1's return to the United States did not cause the
[328]publicity stir that was initially anticipated,
[330]Lo . b. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON~1
[331]reported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full
[332]feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion. The intent of this
[334], article was. to furnish a recapitulation of the entire tactical
[335]situation, In this connection, AMCARBON~-1 pointed ont that he was

[346]‘thinking about exposing the role of Miami attorney Alex E, *CARLSON,
[347]residing 145 Curtiss Parkway, Miami Springs, Florida, in the
[349]Bay of Pigs operation. AMCARBON~1 stated that, 1£ CARLSON were
[351]of any current interest to REUTEMAN, then the Identity 3 would
[353]soft peddle the CARLSON angle, REUTEMAN advised AMCARDON-1 that
[355]be had no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and was of. the
[356]Opinion that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney. The receipt
[357]of this operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON
[359]on the Identity.3's over-all interest in the role that CARLSON had
[360]Played in the Bay of Pigs invasion. This briefing, in turn,
[362]enabled CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting
[363]with AMCARGON-1, . While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this
[365]Bay of Pigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story.
[366]was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish
[367]his research, ....
[369]c.. In- WAVE 0904, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-l advised
[370]JMWAVE that Mr, Trevor *ARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the
[371]Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting
[372]to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic
[373]missiles were hidden in Cuban caves. This information enabled
[374]JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles
[375]which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba,
[377]&lt;d, © In"WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-~2
[378]gave JMWAVE his resume of the discussions which he had with
[379]ANBIDDY~1 ‘atthe Miami Playboy Club on.19 September 1963. This .
[380]information was ‘useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1
[381]was telling. the press. — 4 ,
[382]; . +, "@,3-Im WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON—1
[383].reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with
[384]| AMBIDDY-1's public relations man, This operational intelligence
[385]was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-l1's
[386]‘representatives were telling the outside world about their
[387]operational activities, . .
[389], £. In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-~1 |
[390]informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were
[391]being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK
[392]vessels which were located in South Florida waters. This
[394]. dnformation alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny wag
[395]‘going to be directed toward the Identity 5. Armed with this warn-
[396]ing, JMWAVE-was.able to take action which minimized the publicity
[397]repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5,
[399]g. In WAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1
[400]reported to JMWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from
[401]Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one
[402]Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE,
[403]Headquarters and the Lima Station. This examination revealed
[404]that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no
[405]real. operational potential in this lend, This incident did underscore |.
[406]the fact that AMCARBON~-1 is willing to bring potentially significant q
[407]operational leads to JMWAVE's attention,
[409]h. In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1
[410]advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls
[411]indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had defected
[413]* from.a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previousl
[414]been seen in Miami during November or December 1963, At the same
[415]time, AMCARGON~1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought
[416]that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona
[417]fide defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who
[418]was being used as.a means of creating an incident which would
[419]embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating

[440]that KUBARK had played no role in mounting a provocation operation
[441]against the GOC, At the same time, REUTEMAN pointed out that
[443]it was highly unlikely that curroLA was a GOC agent, As a result
[444]of this conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check
[445]out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story, At the same time,
[446]ANCARBON~l was prevailed upon not to write a story which might
[447]lead the public to speculate on whether GUIROLA was an agent or a
[448]plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC,
[450]7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET, ABCARBON-1 has been used successfully,
[451]during the period dovéered by this report, as a propaganda outlet
[453]through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in
[454]the free world press. Examples of how AMCARBON-~1 has been harnessed
[456]in this field are outlined below: .
[458], | AMCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally
[459]surfaced in. the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de
[460]las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo,
[461]The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information.
[462]relative to GOC activities in Uruguay. The story in the Diario
[464]‘de las Americas had an extremely limited impact on Spanish readers
[466]in the Minmi aren, As a result, it was decided to do a series
[468]of feature stories on AMCRAB-], pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1 _
[469]was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt
[471]they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions
[473]- of obscurity :once the revolution had put CASTRO in power. AMCARBON-]
[475]was briefed in ‘detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an
[477]- Opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 under controlled conditions in a
[479]JMWAVE safehouse.. After completing his debriefing, ANCARDON-1
[480]wrote a series of feature articles on ANCRAB-1, The first article
[481]in the series received front page headline play, The series of
[482]articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they provided an
[484]‘excellent. peg for JMWAVE to mount a replay operation via other
[486]propaganda assets. . ANCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-l was picked up
[487]by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America.
[488]The details of this surfacing can be found in WAVE 5826, dated
[490]14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174,
[491]dated 21 October 1963. ,
[493]sO ’ pb, - Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat. Story. On 26 February 1964
[494]JMWAVE learned that when Mr. Charles GRIFFIN’S sons went to Cuba
[496]-to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that —
[498]. select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over
[500]to them, It was believed that this information would make a good
[501]human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC
[502]propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items
[503]from.the Cuban fishing boats which had violated United States
[504]territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was
[505]given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in
[507]Key West interview Mr, GRIFFIN. This interview was carried out,
[508]and an article outlining the points which were of interest to
[509]JMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the
[510]Identity 3. .
[512]c. LAYC Story, The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santingo,
[513]Chile, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida
[514]newspapers; as a result, REUTENAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March
[515]1964 and suggested that the LAYC meeting was a story which the
[516]Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON~1l was grateful for this steering
[517]tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC
[519]to one of the members of his staff. A story on the LAYC was .
[520]subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 3

[524]c above are attached for Headquarters information, ) ee

[529]8. POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE, Attempts have been made to
[531]obtain aisseminable positive Intelligence from: AMCARBON-1 during .
[533]the period covered by this report, This attempt .has beon fenerally
[535]unsuccessful, in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of
[537]contacts in Latin America who would give him access to worthwhile
[539]intelligence apprecinbly in advance of the information appearing
[541]in the overt press, As a result, AMCARBON-~1 is usually not aware of
[543]inside developments in any Latin * Amer ican country; consequently,
[545]he is not a worthwhile source of positive intelligence, As a
[547]matter of fact, AMCARBON-1 is less valuable as a source of positive
[549]intelligence’. than’ most journalists, This is attributable solely
[551]to bis lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica]
[552]- speene, It is believed that AHCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome :
[554]this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him far fF
[556]the collection of positive intelligence, :
[558]9, COMMENT. tn the period covered by this report, AMCARBON-1
[559]has been Found to be a straight-forward individual who is honest,
[560]cooperative and: who understands the need for security, Our
[561]relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-1 is an accurate reporter
[562]of that information which he passes to KUBARK, In view of this,
[563]JMWAVE plans’ to:.continue to harness AMNCARBON~1 in the same manner
[564]that he has been used in the past. It is believed that our rela-
[565]tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our
[566]operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, this relation-
[567]ship tends to minimize the possibility that JBWAVE might have diffi-|
[568]culties with .the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a
[569]result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON-1, a special
[570]activities report will be forwarded at appropriate intervals.
