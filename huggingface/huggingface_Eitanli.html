In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Holocaust']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.18,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.18&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;3,488,438&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Animal Farm&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;George Orwell&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality.

The scene is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well, war is peace.To Winston Smith, a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short), come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia, whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading, \&quot;I love you.\&quot; The other is O'Brien, who tells him, \&quot;We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\&quot; The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and, against his own desires and instincts, ultimately betrays the other, makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.Alternate cover edition can be found here.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Politics']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.19,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.19&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;4,201,429&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;F.

Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3.69,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3.69&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2,738,919&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;14&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;William Shakespeare&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love.

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with \&quot;woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the \&quot;girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Literature']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.14&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2,085,559&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:21,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;21&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Suzanne Collins&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender.

Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

Yet they have formed a \&quot;family,\&quot; clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3.88,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3.88&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2,396,235&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:24,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;24&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ray Bradbury&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sixty years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future.

Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise: As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world. For over a century, this mesmerizing tale of horror and suspense has enjoyed wide popularity.

This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Aldous Huxley's most enduring masterpiece.The non-fiction work Brave New World Revisited, published in 1958, is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World, including the threats to humanity, such as over-population, propaganda, and chemical persuasion.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Fantasy']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.16,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.16&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;159,408&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5479.Brave_New_World_Brave_New_World_Revisited&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:42,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;42&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Fyodor Dostoevsky&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \&quot;social\&quot;) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', 'American']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;864,334&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:53,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:53,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;53&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A Thousand Splendid Suns&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Khaled Hosseini&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mariam is only fifteen when she is sent to Kabul to marry the troubled and bitter Rasheed, who is thirty years her senior. Nearly two decades later, in a climate of growing unrest, tragedy strikes fifteen-year-old Laila, who must leave her home and join Mariam's unhappy household. Laila and Mariam are to find consolation in each other, their friendship to grow as deep as the bond between sisters, as strong as the ties between mother and daughter. With the passing of time comes Taliban rule over Afghanistan, the streets of Kabul loud with the sound of gunfire and bombs, life a desperate struggle against starvation, brutality and fear, the women's endurance tested beyond their worst imaginings. Yet love can move people to act in unexpected ways, lead them to overcome the most daunting obstacles with a startling heroism. In the end it is love that triumphs over death and destruction.\&quot;A Thousand Splendid Suns\&quot; is a portrait of a wounded country and a story of family and friendship, of an unforgiving time, an unlikely bond, and an indestructible love.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'War', 'Classics']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.42,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.42&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1,428,213&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:54,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:54,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;54&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Anne of Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables, #1)&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;L.M.

Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts—elderly Matthew and his stern sister, Marilla—want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl. But before they can send her back, Anne—who simply must have more scope for her imagination and a real home—wins them over completely. A much-loved classic that explores all the vulnerability, expectations, and dreams of a child growing up, Anne of Green Gables is also a wonderful portrait of a time, a place, a family… and, most of all, love.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.31,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.31&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1,309,236&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:58,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;58&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Maurice Sendak&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Max, a wild and naughty boy, is sent to bed without his supper by his exhausted mother.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \&quot;lickings\&quot; from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \&quot;tattle-tale.\&quot;  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \&quot;engaged\&quot; by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \&quot;engaged\&quot; previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:\&quot;TOM!\&quot; No answer. \&quot;TOM!\&quot; No answer. \&quot;What's gone with that boy,  I wonder?

In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch.

In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

Auden wrote, \&quot;Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'School']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3.85,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3.85&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;918,431&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:80,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;80&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Audrey Niffenegger&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is the extraordinary love story of Clare and Henry, who met when Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-two and Henry was thirty.

War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.As Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature', 'War']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.15,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.15&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;310,975&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656.War_and_Peace&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:87,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;87&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Little House Collection (Little House, #1-9)&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This nine-book paperback box set of the classic series features the classic black-and-white artwork from Garth Williams.The nine books in the timeless Little House series tell the story of Laura’s real childhood as an American pioneer, and are cherished by readers of all generations. They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family—Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma’s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa’s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing—his very own horse—but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. With snow piled as high as the rooftops, it’s impossible for trains to deliver supplies, and the townspeople, including Laura and her family, are starving. Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and “literaries,” work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It’s not easy, and for the first time she’s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! They move to a small prairie homestead to start their lives together. But each year brings new challenges—storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. And through it all, Laura and Almanzo still have their love, which only grows when baby Rose arrives.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical', 'Middle Grade']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.35,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.35&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;150,166&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114345.The_Little_House_Collection&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:88,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:88,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;88&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Anthony Burgess&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In Anthony Burgess's influential nightmare vision of the future, criminals take over after dark.

Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel.

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (المكية) or Medinan (المدنية) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation. Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Religion', 'Islam', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Reference', 'Spirituality']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.38,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.38&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;65,695&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646462._&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:94,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:94,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;94&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ayn Rand&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world and did.

What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit.

Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky remains true to the verbalinventiveness of Dostoevsky’s prose, preserving the multiple voices, the humor, and the surprising modernity of the original.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Poetry', 'Feminism']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.28,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.28&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;501,912&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13214.I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:98,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;98&quot;},&quot;Book&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot;},&quot;Author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Joseph Smith Jr.&quot;},&quot;Description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.&quot;},&quot;Genres&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'American']&quot;},&quot;Avg_Rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3.53,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3.53&quot;},&quot;Num_Ratings&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;535,225&quot;},&quot;URL&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:10000,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzEwNSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0VpdGFubGkvZ29vZHJlYWRzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTI2NzA1LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.U764wL60HvOBzWhH-djHY3gP1C7uIaCZ58TxcZYH6jIxf0r5eqdtQNtbMNr2JtlXg955XAsEAP19kf4PcycnCw&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;Eitanli/goodreads&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;64007b0f261cfa61f39d1473&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64007b0f261cfa61f39d1473/noO7S55CA9QwrahhuRPkP.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Eitan Lifshits&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Eitanli&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:1},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

"To Kill A Mockingbird" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, "To Kill A Mockingbird" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</span></div></div>

Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268</span></div></div>

In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover</span></div></div>

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.</span></div></div>

Critics have hailed it as his "most solid, most brilliant" work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence, it is in every sense timely. The scene is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well, war is peace.To Winston Smith, a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short), come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia, whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading, "I love you." The other is O'Brien, who tells him, "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness." The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and, against his own desires and instincts, ultimately betrays the other, makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.Alternate cover edition can be found here.</span></div></div>

The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.The Catcher in the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.
J.D. Salinger's
 (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</span></div></div>

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.</span></div></div>

Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes.

They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”</span></div></div>

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</span></div></div>

“I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that'swhy.”
They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face"; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a "family," clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.</span></div></div>

For the Fourth Edition, the editor has collated the 1847 text with several modern editions and has corrected a number of variants, including accidentals. The text is accompanied by entirely new explanatory annotations.New to the fourth Edition are twelve of Emily Bronte's letters regarding the publication of the 1847 edition of Wuthering Heights as well as the evolution of the 1850 edition, prose and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and Edward Chitham's insightful and informative chronology of the creative process behind the beloved work.Five major critical interpretations of Wuthering Heights are included, three of them new to the Fourth Edition. A Stuart Daley considers the importance of chronology in the novel. J. Hillis Miller examines Wuthering Heights's problems of genre and critical reputation. Sandra M. Gilbert assesses the role of Victorian Christianity plays in the novel, while Martha Nussbaum traces the novel's romanticism. Finally, Lin Haire-Sargeant scrutinizes the role of Heathcliff in film adaptations of Wuthering Heights. A Chronology and updated Selected Bibliography are also included.</span></div></div>

Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise: As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world. For over a century, this mesmerizing tale of horror and suspense has enjoyed wide popularity. It ranks as one of Wilde's most important creations and among the classic achievements of its kind.</span></div></div>

Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film "Henry V", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with "Bbc" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of "Hamlet" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare - a recording to be treasured for decades to come.</span></div></div>

Through the most efficient scientific and psychological engineering, people are genetically designed to be passive and therefore consistently useful to the ruling class. This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Aldous Huxley's most enduring masterpiece.The non-fiction work Brave New World Revisited, published in 1958, is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World, including the threats to humanity, such as over-population, propaganda, and chemical persuasion.</span></div></div>

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.</span></div></div>

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for "social") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.</span></div></div>

Nearly two decades later, in a climate of growing unrest, tragedy strikes fifteen-year-old Laila, who must leave her home and join Mariam's unhappy household. Laila and Mariam are to find consolation in each other, their friendship to grow as deep as the bond between sisters, as strong as the ties between mother and daughter. With the passing of time comes Taliban rule over Afghanistan, the streets of Kabul loud with the sound of gunfire and bombs, life a desperate struggle against starvation, brutality and fear, the women's endurance tested beyond their worst imaginings. Yet love can move people to act in unexpected ways, lead them to overcome the most daunting obstacles with a startling heroism. In the end it is love that triumphs over death and destruction."A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a portrait of a wounded country and a story of family and friendship, of an unforgiving time, an unlikely bond, and an indestructible love.</span></div></div>

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.</span></div></div>

Alice Walker's iconic modern classic is now a Penguin Book.A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence. Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie, Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. The Color Purple broke the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined, Alice Walker's epic carries readers on a spirit-affirming journey towards redemption and love.</span></div></div>

The most famous and perhaps the most popular of his works, it compresses an event of immense complexity to the scale of a family history, with a cast of characters that includes a bloodthirsty ogress and an antihero as believably flawed as any in modern fiction. Though the least typical of the author’s novels, A Tale of Two Cities still underscores many of his enduring themes—imprisonment, injustice, social anarchy, resurrection, and the renunciation that fosters renewal.</span></div></div>

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives "lickings" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a "tattle-tale."  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get "engaged" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been "engaged" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:"TOM!" No answer. "TOM!" No answer. "What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. "I never did see the beat of that boy!"</span></div></div>

In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch. As Rosemary Edmonds comments, 'He leaves the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope to bring home the meaning of the brooding words following the title, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.</span></div></div>

For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.</span></div></div>

In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.</span></div></div>

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes." With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, "Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man."</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">In Russia's struggle with Napoleon, Tolstoy saw a tragedy that involved all mankind. War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.As Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.</span></div></div>

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family—Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma’s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa’s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing—his very own horse—but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. With snow piled as high as the rooftops, it’s impossible for trains to deliver supplies, and the townspeople, including Laura and her family, are starving. Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and “literaries,” work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It’s not easy, and for the first time she’s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! They move to a small prairie homestead to start their lives together. But each year brings new challenges—storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. And through it all, Laura and Almanzo still have their love, which only grows when baby Rose arrives.</span></div></div>

In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel. The book has been enormously influential on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, "just as some people read the Bible."</span></div></div>

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (المكية) or Medinan (المدنية) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation. Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.</span></div></div>

Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, that is the first of your premises to check.</span></div></div>

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.</span></div></div>

But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.</span></div></div>
