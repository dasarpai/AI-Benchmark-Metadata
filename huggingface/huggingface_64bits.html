The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$.

So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series.

But if it wasn't for the content inset, you would never be able to have the top of the content clear that transparent navigation bar when you go all the way to the top.\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;23-stackexchange&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;conversations&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How is arc defined in TikZ?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;```\\draw (x,y) arc (start:stop:radius);``` draws an arc\n\n* with radius ```radius```\n* starts from ```(x,y)```\n* with center ```(x-r*cos(start), y-r*sin(start))``` and\n* ends at ```(x-r*cos(start)+r*cos(stop), y-r*sin(start)+r*sin(stop))```.\n\nFor example,\n``` \\draw[red] (0,0) arc (30:60:3);\n```\ndraws an arc\n\n* of radius ```3```\n* starting from ```(0,0)```\n* with center ```(0-3*cos(30),0-3*sin(30))``` and\n* ending at ```(0-3*cos(30)+3*cos(60),0-3*sin(30)+3*sin(60))```.\n\n```\\draw[blue] (0,0) -- ++(30+180:3) -- +(60:3);\n```\ndraw a blue line to the arc to make a complete sector.\n\nMinimal Working Example\n```\\documentclass[tikz,border=12pt]{standalone}\n\\begin{document}\n\\foreach \\start/\\stop in {30/60,45/90,135/180,0/180,45/315}\n{\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}\n        \\draw[lightgray,ultra thin] (-6,-6) grid (6,6);\n        \\draw[red] (0,0) arc (\\start:\\stop:3);\n        \\draw[blue] (0,0) -- ++(\\start+180:3) -- +(\\stop:3);\n        \\node[anchor=north] at (0,6) {$(\\start:\\stop:3)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n\n\n&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;How is arc defined in TikZ?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;```\\\\draw (x,y) arc (start:stop:radius);``` draws an arc\\n\\n* with radius ```radius```\\n* starts from ```(x,y)```\\n* with center ```(x-r*cos(start), y-r*sin(start))``` and\\n* ends at ```(x-r*cos(start)+r*cos(stop), y-r*sin(start)+r*sin(stop))```.\\n\\nFor example,\\n``` \\\\draw[red] (0,0) arc (30:60:3);\\n```\\ndraws an arc\\n\\n* of radius ```3```\\n* starting from ```(0,0)```\\n* with center ```(0-3*cos(30),0-3*sin(30))``` and\\n* ending at ```(0-3*cos(30)+3*cos(60),0-3*sin(30)+3*sin(60))```.\\n\\n```\\\\draw[blue] (0,0) -- ++(30+180:3) -- +(60:3);\\n```\\ndraw a blue line to the arc to make a complete sector.\\n\\nMinimal Working Example\\n```\\\\documentclass[tikz,border=12pt]{standalone}\\n\\\\begin{document}\\n\\\\foreach \\\\start/\\\\stop in {30/60,45/90,135/180,0/180,45/315}\\n{\\n    \\\\begin{tikzpicture}\\n        \\\\draw[lightgray,ultra thin] (-6,-6) grid (6,6);\\n        \\\\draw[red] (0,0) arc (\\\\start:\\\\stop:3);\\n        \\\\draw[blue] (0,0) -- ++(\\\\start+180:3) -- +(\\\\stop:3);\\n        \\\\node[anchor=north] at (0,6) {$(\\\\start:\\\\stop:3)$};\\n    \\\\end{tikzpicture}\\n}\\n\\\\end{document}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;24-stackexchange&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;conversations&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How to connect mysql workbench to running mysql inside docker?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;By default after deployment MySQL has following connection restrictions:\n```mysql> select host, user from mysql.user;\n+-----------+---------------+\n| host      | user          |\n+-----------+---------------+\n| localhost | healthchecker |\n| localhost | mysql.session |\n| localhost | mysql.sys     |\n| localhost | root          |\n+-----------+---------------+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n```\nApparently, for the security purposes you will not be able to connect to it outside of the docker image.\nIf you need to change that to allow root to connect from any host (say, for development purposes), do:\n\n* Start your mysql image with all port mappings required:\n```docker run -p 3306:3306 --name=mysql57 -d mysql/mysql-server:5.7```\n\nor, if the complete port mapping is required:\n```docker run -p 3306:3306 -p 33060:33060 --name=mysql57 -d mysql/mysql-server:5.7\n```\n\n* If this is the fresh installation - grab the default password:\n```docker logs mysql57 2>&amp;1 | grep GENERATED```\n* Connect using ```mysql``` client directly to the mysqld in docker:\n```docker exec -it mysql57 mysql -uroot -p```\n* If this is the fresh installation you will be asked to change the password using ```ALTER USER``` command.

Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades).

Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles.

Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle.

(Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he/she doesn't train for strength per se.

What is the meaning of such a class. Do all the methods of the static class need to be ```static``` too? Is it required the other way round, that if a class contains all the static methods, shall the class be static too? What are static classes good for?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\&quot;Static value: \&quot; + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\&quot;Value squared: \&quot; + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes?

The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\\n\\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\\n     public static void main(String []args){\\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\\n        System.out.println(\\\&quot;Static value: \\\&quot; + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\\n        System.out.println(\\\&quot;Value squared: \\\&quot; + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\\n     }\\n}\\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\\n        myStaticMember = 1;\\n    }\\n    private static int myStaticMember;\\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\\n        myStaticMember = val;\\n    }\\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\\n        return myStaticMember;\\n    }\\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nWhat good are static classes?

Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch.

Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide.

The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method.

In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor.

Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere. This would lead to rapid degradation of the CCDs used for scanning across the sky.\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;70-stackexchange&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;conversations&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I have a string representing a unix timestamp (i.e. &amp;quot;1284101485&amp;quot;) in Python, and I'd like to convert it to a readable date.

But when I try this with a Raspberry Pi system image (e.g. raspbian), I get:\n```mount: unknown filesystem type '(null)'\n```\nAnd no matter what I try with ```-t```, it won't work.  How can I mount this image?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \&quot;FAT32\&quot;, and the other one \&quot;Linux\&quot;. Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```/mnt/img/one``` and ```/mnt/img/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two\n```\nIf you get an \&quot;overlapping loop\&quot; error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.

How can I mount this image?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\\n```\\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \\\&quot;FAT32\\\&quot;, and the other one \\\&quot;Linux\\\&quot;. Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\\n```\\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\\n\\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\\n\\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```/mnt/img/one``` and ```/mnt/img/two``` available as mount points:\\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two\\n```\\nIf you get an \\\&quot;overlapping loop\\\&quot; error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\\\\n    -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\\n```\\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \\nYou can now access the two partitions.

Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \&quot;excuse me\&quot; or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning.

    "value": "The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration)."

It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.\nIt was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!\nSo I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they? "
  },
  {
    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the “original” 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand."

But GTOs are more popular because they are easier to calculate with. GTOs decay with $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, so its adequate to sometimes add diffuse functions to the GTO basis set to compensate for gaussian decay behaviour.\nAlso, exact hydrogen wavefunctions decay exponentially, so the motivation for STOs.\nI understand that the only boundary requirement for solving the Schrödinger equation for atoms and molecules in free space is that the wavefunction goes zero as $r \\to \\infty$, but there are no a priori requirements for the way it decays as it does so.\nMy question is: do we have theoretical (ab initio) and/or experimental reasons to believe that all atomic and molecular wavefunctions decay like $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$."

    "value": "I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schrödinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}))\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon &lt; 0\n$$\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\mathbf{r})\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon &lt; 0\n$$\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nfor some unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President’s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.  Given these and other concerns, we believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s Administration.\n[...]\nSenator Charles Schumer\nSenator Richard Durbin\nSenator Patty Murray\nSenator Debbie Stabenow\nSenator Patrick Leahy\n\nBased on this letter, it appears their main objections to a full border wall are currently the cost-benefit ratio and the legal issues of taking land from Americans to build it on; objections that may not be unique to Democrats."

    "value": "DOOM itself doesn’t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for “VGA compatible” adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn’t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus."

In neither case are we executing arbitrary text, so it doesn't have an inherent \"but you can type ```'filename ; rm -rf /'```\" problem, and if the file name can be corrupted, using ```subprocess.call``` gives us little additional protection.\n* Error handling: It doesn't actually give us any more error detection, we're still depending on the ```retcode``` in either case; but the behavior to explicitly raise an exception in the case of an error will certainly help you notice if there is a failure (though in some scenarios, a traceback might not at all be more helpful than simply ignoring the error).\n* Spawns a (non-blocking) subprocess: We don't need to wait for the child process, since we're by problem statement starting a separate process.\n\nTo the objection \"But ```subprocess``` is preferred.\"  However, ```os.system()``` is not deprecated, and it's in some sense the simplest tool for this particular job. Conclusion: using ```os.system()``` is therefore also a correct answer.\nA marked disadvantage is that the Windows ```start``` command requires you to pass in ```shell=True``` which negates most of the benefits of using ```subprocess```.\n"

That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here. Turkey is actively inviting foreign investors, but China is quite reluctant to allow foreign economic influence in their country."

    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "This is a great question, with no one right answer.\nThe strength of a patent comes from the ability to enforce it. If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish."

Upcast operations (also called widening conversions in the Java Language Specification) convert a subclass reference to an ancestor class reference. This casting operation is normally automatic, since it's always safe and can be implemented directly by the compiler. Downcast operations (also called narrowing conversions in the Java Language Specification) convert an ancestor class reference to a subclass reference. This casting operation creates execution overhead, since Java requires that the cast be checked at runtime to make sure that it's valid.

Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine.\"\n\nBlatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in São Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today.\nAlthough it's not quite \"instant replay,\" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: \"Hawk-Eye\" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and \"GoalRef\" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed \"goal\" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup. The Guardian provides a pretty helpful FAQ on the technology.\nFIFA may choose to implement further changes to approved goal-line technology and referee rules when it meets again after the World Cup."

This come also with the side benefit that unsecured HTTP connection will still be at least marginally protected, even if at least to protect users of the infrastructure from each other, but not from the infrastructure provider.\nNetwork encryption is designed to protect the network, not the service.

The Navigation bar and status bar are transparent, and the contents of the scroll view are visible underneath. That's because the scroll view's frame extends out that far. But if it wasn't for the content inset, you would never be able to have the top of the content clear that transparent navigation bar when you go all the way to the top."

So unlike in a can, most pathogens were destroyed, but not necessarily all of them. For human consumption, that’s perfectly fine as long as the remaining ones don’t get the time-temperature combo to regrow.\nSecond, a bread dough may be dense (although the aim is usually something different), but by no means airtight. Interestingly, wrapping meat in dense dough was used as preservation method in medieval times - the “ancestor” of today’s pork pies and pastries. But while the hard flour crust (not intended to be eaten originally) did form a protective layer and usually extended the shelf life more or less, it was by no means food safe judged by modern standards - although some pies were stored for months. But your fluffy buns are truly not a protective layer. Which means you should refrigerate your buns, but also that you get to enjoy the whole dish."

    "value": "Birds are both flying dinosaurs and flying reptiles. Yes, that's potentially confusing.\n\nTo understand the apparent contradiction, you have to understand how modern classification of organisms works (phylogenetic systematics). Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\n\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\n\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation."

It is called \"generalization/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.  Don't be afraid.  But do test your initial design for performance. If your first attempt is simple and sound, you'll be able to tweak it to speed it up."

Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &amp;quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&amp;quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency — e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason — as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion."

    "value": "Halflings were originally called hobbits prior to a legal challenge.\nAccording to Gary Gygax himself, it was due to a legal claim on &amp;quot;hobbit&amp;quot; by a company who purchased the merchandising rights on Tolkien's works in 1976:\n\nTSR was served with papers threatening damages to the tune of half a mil by the Saul Zantes (sp?) division of Elan Merchandising on behalf of the tolkien Estate. The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&amp;D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &amp;quot;hobbits&amp;quot; in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &amp;quot;halfling&amp;quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &amp;quot;hobbit&amp;quot; remained on page 6 of Men &amp; Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976. Zaents would go on to produce the 1978 Lord of the Rings animated movie."

The ```allocation unit size``` option should be default, and the ```File System``` option should be set to ```FAT32```.

I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size. Obviously, traditional strength training with low volume and low sets (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the best approach. Strength training does cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al, 1985), but it won't cause maximum hypertrophy.\n\nWhat is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true? That is, can a buff guy (with lots of prominent muscle) actually be weak? "
  },
  {
    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass."

    "value": "Here are some common concerns about using tree planting projects to create carbon offsets:\n\n* The scheme actually has a net positive effect, both in the short and long-term/\nHow effective a tree planting scheme is in capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is for a large part determined by what happens to the trees after they are planted. When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."

This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3/(4 \\pi / 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.  By computing all interpoint distances you can compare the data to this ideal.\nGeneral principles of constructing statistical graphics suggest a good way to make the comparison is to plot variance-stabilized residuals $e_i(d_{[i]} - e_i)$ against $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n(n-1)/2=m$ where $d_{[i]}$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ smallest of the mutual distances and $e_i = 2\\sqrt{i/m}$.

In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.\n"

Examples would include vendors, quest givers, or enemies. In some games, (particularly RPG's), the term is also used to refer to characters under the control of, but not generated by the player. They are often distinguished by having distinct personalities and dialog, whereas a \"\"Player Character\"\" is meant as more of an extension of the player themselves. Think of the companion party members in the Mass Effect series for an example.\n\nA Bot, by contrast, is essentially a player of the game controlled by a computer. This can be populated within a single instance, as a feature in some games (i.e. AI opponents in a normally multiplayer game), or, in some cases, actually represents a separate instance of the application running on a networked computer and being controlled by some manner of AI script (as is common in many MMO's, much to the dismay of the communities playing the game). The term 'Bot' is also often used to refer to software used to enhance or replace the skills of a human player of the game; for example, an 'Aim-Bot' that handles targeting, or a 'Farming Bot' in an MMO that performs tedious or menial tasks. Such bots are usually (though not always), considered cheating and a violation of the Terms of Service of the game in question."

    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```. If Java allowed top-level classes to be declared ```static``` then the Math class would indeed be static."

Amidala initiated the vote that removed his predecessor. Jar-Jar initiated the vote that gave him emergency powers. The Jedi Council allowed him to operate under their noses.

Along with Luna Lovegood, he was the only member of Dumbledore's Army to reply to the summons via the coins.\n\n\nSeventh year\n\n* Neville got in trouble with the Carrows for refusing to practise the Cruciatus Curse on other students as a method of punishment, as well as for standing up against their bigotry and cruelty.\n\n* along with Ginny and Luna, restarted Dumbledore's Army.\n\n* attempted to steal Godric Gryffindor's Sword from Snape's office\n\n* Neville was eventually left alone to lead the rebellion efforts (Luna and Ginny were not in Hogwarts anymore).

He was subsequently forced to wear the Sorting Hat as it burned because he refused to join Voldemort. Fortunately, due to Harry's sacrifice, Neville was able to shrug off the Full Body-Bind Curse.\n\n* Because of his tremendous bravery shown on the battlefield, Neville was able to pull Godric Gryffindor's Sword from the burning hat, in the process proving himself a true Gryffindor, something that was doubted constantly throughout due to his apparently weak-willed, shy, and bumbling nature. In a single stroke, he killed Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last remaining Horcrux.\n\n* Neville subsequently teamed up with Ron Weasley as the defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters were forced into the Great Hall and defeated Fenrir Greyback.\n\nAll in all, pretty convincing evidence of someone's bravery."

Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US/Chinese population ratio of about 1/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds."

This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.\n* From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.\n* Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.\n\nAll of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.\nWhere you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. It is said to help improve the crema.\nOne thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer.\n\n* Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.\n* Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA."

That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal)."

I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"

    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time."

Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!"

    "value": "There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\n\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden)."

Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```"

Instead functions in JavaScript may be made to behave like constructors by preceding a function call with the ```new``` keyword. This is known as the constructor pattern.\nIn JavaScript everything is an object except for the primitive data types (boolean, number and string), and ```undefined```. On the other hand ```null``` is actually an object reference even though you may at first believe otherwise. This is the reason ```typeof null``` returns ```&amp;quot;object&amp;quot;```.\nFunctions in JavaScript are similar to functables in Lua (i.e. they are callable objects). Hence a function can be used in place of an object. Similarly arrays are also objects in JavaScript. On the other hand objects can be thought of as associative arrays.\nThe most important point however is that there are no classes in JavaScript because JavaScript is a prototypal object oriented language. This means that objects in JavaScript directly inherit from other objects. Hence we don't need classes. All we need is a way to create and extend objects.\n"

The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future."

This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute. In the years to come, you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers' prices."

However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \"FAT32\", and the other one \"Linux\". Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```/mnt/img/one``` and ```/mnt/img/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two\n```\nIf you get an \"overlapping loop\" error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\n    -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\n```\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \nYou can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the ```-r``` (read-only) switch too.  If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the ```.img``` file.\nNote that the first partition is probably mounted on ```/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running."

    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language."

Variable assignments  and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The  return status is the exit status of list.\n  { list; } list  is simply executed in the current shell environment. list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.  The return  status  is the exit status of list.  Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is  permitted  to  be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the shell syntax is quite consistent and the subshell participates also in the other ```()``` constructs like command substitution (also with the old-style ````..```` syntax) or process substitution, so the following won't exit from the current shell either:\n```echo $(exit)\ncat &lt;(exit)\n```\n\nWhile it may be obvious that subshells are involved when commands are placed explicitly inside ```()```, the less visible fact is that they are also spawned in these other structures:\n\n* command started in the background\n```exit &amp;\n```\ndoesn't exit the current shell because (after ```man bash```)\n\n  If a command is terminated by the control operator &amp;, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.

For example ```bash``` puts all components of the pipeline into separate subshells (unless you use the ```lastpipe``` option in invocations where job control is not enabled), but AT&amp;T ```ksh``` and ```zsh``` run the last part inside the current shell (both behaviours are allowed by POSIX). Thus\n```exit | exit | exit\n```\ndoes basically nothing in bash, but exits from the zsh because of the last ```exit```.\n* ```coproc exit``` also runs ```exit``` in a subshell.\n"

Collection views provide the same general function as table views except that a collection view is able to support more than just single-column layouts. Collection views support customizable layouts that can be used to implement multi-column grids, tiled layouts, circular layouts, and many more.

UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView, which allows users to scroll through the table, although UITableView allows vertical scrolling only. The cells comprising the individual items of the table are UITableViewCell objects; UITableView uses these objects to draw the visible rows of the table. Cells have content—titles and images—and can have, near the right edge, accessory views. Standard accessory views are disclosure indicators or detail disclosure buttons; the former leads to the next level in a data hierarchy and the latter leads to a detailed view of a selected item. Accessory views can also be framework controls, such as switches and sliders, or can be custom views. Table views can enter an editing mode where users can insert, delete, and reorder rows of the table. "

    "value": "The three-body problem is one of the most famous problems in the history of mathematics, which also has an important application in science: it was supposed to explain the Moon's motion, among other things. Enormous effort was spent on this problem by many famous mathematicians of the 18th and 19th centuries. Since Newton's time it was clear that there was no simple closed form solution. (The problem also had an important practical application in 18th century, namely to navigation. If you can predict the motion of the Moon for few years ahead with sufficient accuracy, you can determine longitude at sea without a chronometer, just by observing Moon's position with respect to the stars).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, an exact mathematical formulation of what was desired was achieved: to express the motions of the bodies in the form of convergent series of functions of time, valid for all times. Few people remember nowadays that in this precise form the problem was actually solved (by Sundman, at the very end of the 19th century). This solution can be found in Siegel's book on celestial mechanics.\n\nBut by that time it was already understood that this solution was useless for practical purposes, namely for prediction of the Moon's motion over long time periods. It was also useless for understanding the qualitative features of the motion."

    "value": "The first thing to know is the communication is one-way. There's a satellite-to-receiver transmission, nothing going in the opposite direction. So your cell phone doesn't have to find the radio power to send a signal all the way to space!\n(exceptions: The decommissioned Chinese BeiDou-1 system - and any products where the GPS receiver chip is used alongside a satellite transmitter, like a Cospas-Sarsat emergency locator beacon)\nThe signal from GPS satellites is very faint - each satellite has to broadcast a signal to about half the planet, powered only by some solar panels! So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing."

  },
  {
    "from": "gpt",
    "value": "In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value. A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%.\nMost importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\n\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\n\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\nBut this is disputed because\n\nLettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa.\nLactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name ‘lettuce opium’.\nEdible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium.\n\nLettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition).\nIt is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce. Regardless of the laudanum/lactucin status, there's no reason to feed iceberg because of the low nutrient value.\nThe House Rabbit Society's website has even more details on what foods are good for rabbits and why."
