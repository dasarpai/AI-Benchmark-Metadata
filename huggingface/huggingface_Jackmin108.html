What advantages does kopete bring that could not have been submitted to gaim itself? Why go to the time and effort to independently develop two programs which do virtually the same thing?\nNow there are other, significant differences. Gaim uses the GTK+ toolkit. Kopete uses Qt. Gaim is primarily C, Kopete is C++. In fact Kopete is fairly tightly bounded to KDE, whereas I think Gaim is not so quite involved with Gnome.\nSo we can reduce this redundancy problem to the problem of two desktops, if it is a problem. I'm not sure it is, after all competition is good and drives development. Is it that much of a problem that some coders have spent time and effort re-inventing the wheel anyway?\nWell I think it is a problem, unless you are heavily camped in either desktop. I'm not. When I develop a GUI application, I have to make a decision about which environment suits me best. I know there's more to it than that - Gnome has all that other stuff like Glib and KDE isn't just QT - but the GUI is a major consideration.\nSo if I opt for (say) GTK+, will some QT zealot prefer to code an alternative to using my version?\nI run a mixture of Gnome and KDE applications. I use Konqueror as a web browser, Gimp for some graphic stuff, etc. The two toolkits are somewhat annoying because they do not interact particularly well.\nWhen I write a GUI app, I want the interface code to be as separate from the logic as possible, to make swapping them in and out as easy as possible. Don't code an alternative, write a new interface for me!\nGlade is a GTK+ interface builder. You use a drag-and-drop program to compose a UI, and it can generate the corresponding GTK+ code. You can save the project seperately as an XML application.\nWhat is really exciting however is the companion libglade. This library reads in the XML that Glade writes at runtime and constructs the UI from that.\nYou therefore don't even need to necessarily use the UI builder to generate the XML if you don't want to. Perhaps you'll just translate a UI described in a different XML application.\nSo why do I think this is exciting?\nAlter/tweak the UI at runtime, without a recompilation.\nTranslate (via XSL) an interface description in a different XML application. I haven't looked at the design of the XML glade dialect much myself, it might be a nightmare; but at least that nightmare could be hidden behind a translation.\nWant a KDE version? Write a runtime, XML-interpreting UI builder for KDE!\nArgh! so this rant has gone off-track a little bit. What else have I got to cover?&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-23T18:39:18Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://jmtd.net/log/geek/linux/ui/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CHARLES H. MEISNER, one of the prosperous and highly-esteemed business men of Birnamwood, Shawano county, was born in Newton township, Manitowoc Co., Wis., February 14, 1860, and is a son of Frederick and Magarette (Steltzer) Meisner, both natives of Germany.\nFrederick Meisner was born February 5, 1825, in Mechlenburg, Germany, and after the death of his father he, with his mother and the rest of the family, came to America in 1849, settling in Manitowoc county. Here the mother lived to the good old age, dying in 1888. The parental family comprised six children, namely John, Frederick, Joseph, Dora, Josephine and Mary. The mother of our subject was born in Bavaria about the year 1832. Her mother died in Germany, and about 1850 she came to America with her father and her three brothers; John, William and Nicholas—and three sisters—Mary, Cathrena and Lena. Her father was a farmer by occupation. Frederick Meisner had six children of whom Charles H., Frederick J. and Henry are living; William died when four years old; John when an infant, and a daughter, Bertha, when nine months old. This worthy couple at present reside on a farm purchased by Mr. Meisner some thirty-seven years ago, and which is situated near Manitowoc City. They are consistent members of the German Lutheran Church, and Frederick Meisner is a stanch Republican, although he has never taken a very active part in political matters.\nCharles H. Meisner was reared to the life of a farmer's boy, obtaining his education in the common schools, and assisting his father upon the farm until he was of age. He then spent several summers working upon a farm. In June, 1884, in company with John Roepke, he came to Birnamwood, where he bought out a store owned by Hunter and Cole, and organized the firm of Roepke &amp; Meisner, proprietors of a general mercantile store. In 1889 they commenced the manufacture of lumber, buying and repairing a mill and furnishing employment to fifteen men, on an average. Both these gentlemen have built themselves handsome residences, and have dealt extensively in real estate, now owning some 1,300 acres of timber and farming lands. Charles H. Meisner was married January 4, 1884 to Miss Meta Pleuss, who was born in the same town and county as her husband. She is a daughter of Frederick and Mary (Levereriz) Pleuss, natives of Germany; who came to, America about 1850. The father; who was a farmer, died in 1877. They had a family of five daughters—Mary, Lizzie, Meta, Augusta and Minnie. Both the parents had children by former marriages. Mr. and Mrs. Meisner have no children.\nIn politics our subject is a good Republican, but has always been too busy attending to his own affairs to become an office-seeker. However, his fellow-citizens have shown their appreciation of his worth by making him town treasurer, and electing him to the minor offices. He was postmaster for eight years, and is one of the trustees of the village. He and his wife are members of the German Lutheran Church, and are held in high esteem.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-19T11:07:52Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://synergistic-technologies.com/biocmeisner.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;EVER WONDER WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN WORK NIGHTS AND SLEEP EASILY DURING THE DAY?\nA new study from Tiina Pauno, a professor at the University of Helsinki, Finland found that many night workers actually have a variant in the genetic code that makes them less influenced by Melatonin and hence the circadian rhythm.\nThey tested 577 shift workers and looked for a genetic changes for job-related exhaustion. The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function.

This early vision led to rapid growth and success, and Purple Wave was widely regarded as a trusted online destination that brought corporate sellers and buyers together. As Purple Wave evolved, it had an opportunity to take advantage of the data it was collecting. After hearing Icimo CEO Bryce Gartner speak at a National Auctioneers Association event, Purple Wave engaged Icimo to develop a business intelligence strategy. The insights gained were striking from the beginning.\nAccording to David, data that used to take weeks, months or even years to acquire is now available to management in a matter of minutes, allowing for quick and informed decisions about critical business issues.\nAs Purple Wave began to refocus on specific segments, the continued insight gleaned from icimo and Tableau shifted to a more targeted and strategic marketing effort.

As early as 5000 B.C. the Egyptians played a form of Bocce with polished rocks. Graphic representations of figures tossing a ball or polished stone have been recorded as early as 5200 B.C. While Bocce today looks quite different from its early predecessors, the unbroken thread of Bocce’s lineage is the consistently common objective of trying to come as close to a fixed target as possible.\nFrom this early objective, the basic rules of Bocce were born. From Egypt, the game made its way to Greece around 800 B.C. The Romans learned the game from the Greeks, and then introduced it throughout the empire. The Roman influence in bocce is preserved in the game’s name; bocce derives from the Vulgate Latin bottia, meaning boss.\nThe early Romans were among the first to play a game resembling what we know as Bocce today. In early times they used coconuts brought back from Africa and later used hard olive wood to carve out Bocce balls. Beginning with Emperor Augustus, Bocce became the sport of statesman and rulers. From the early Greek physician Hippocrates to the great Italian Renaissance man Galileo, the early participants of Bocce have noted that the game’s athleticism and spirit of competition rejuvenates the body.\nIn 1576, the Republic of Venice publicly condemned the sport, punishing those who played with fines and imprisonment. And perhaps most grave was the condemnation by the Catholic Church which deterred the laity and officially prohibited clergyman from playing the game by proclaiming Bocce a means of gambling.\nBocce frequently lost and gained popularity throughout the ages. It was Giuseppe Garibaldi, who, while unifying and nationalizing Italy, popularized the sport as it is known today. In 1896, during a resurgence of popularity, the first Bocce Olympiad was held in Athens, Greece. Bocce has been a part of international sports ever since.\nThanks to many Italian immigrants at the turn of the century, Bocce has come to flourish in the United States. During its beginnings in the U.S., there were as many versions of the game as there were towns the immigrants had left. The popularity of Bocce in America has been on the rise since then and there are more than 25,000,000 Bocce enthusiasts throughout the United States today.\&quot;\nNext to Soccer and Golf, Bocce is the third most participated sport in the world and is considered the oldest know sport in world history.\nAl Scaramella hosted the game that I attended. This day there were enough players to field two teams of four, one throwing red balls, the other green. Teams are determined as each player pulls a red or green ball out of a sack. Green always goes first.\nThe game starts with a member of the green team tossing out the Pallino, the small orange ball being thrown by Joe, above, who then rolls his green ball as close as he can to the Pallino. Red then tries to get closer to the Pallino than the green ball and each member of the red team rolls until a red ball ends up closest to the Pallino or all four reds are no closer than the green. Green gets to go again if a red ball ends up closer to the Pallino.\nAbove, the next ball to be thrown would be green since the red ball ended up closest to the Pallino. Capiche?\nAs in most sports, form is everything. Above Tony Alexander displays his form developed over years of playing bocce, starting \&quot;when I was only this high\&quot; said Tony with his hand waist high.\nHost Al Scaramella was just as effective using the same form as Tony. Both showed the results of years playing bocce.\nStrategy plays a big part in the game. Sometimes it's better to hit the ball of an opposing team than try to get close to the Pallino. The boards can also be used to position a ball behind the Pallino.\nAbove, Kevin tosses early in a game as Dennis, Tony, Aaron and Walter wait their turn. Tony and Al usually were anchors for their teams as it becomes important not to hit a ball of your same color and loose a point.\nSometimes a measurement has to be taken to determine which ball is closest. In the case above, one red ball is clearly closest but if the second red ball is closer to the Pallino than the green ball, then the red team gets two points instead of just one. Capiche?\nBetween games. Al Zambonis the court. Al built the court about four years ago and has been honing his skills ever since. Most remember when Bertuccis opened in 1984 or 85 with a Bocce court in the middle of the dining room. The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\nFirst team to reach 11 and is ahead by at least two points wins. This day the green team won every game even though there were different players each time.\nThere is at least one other Bocce court in Holliston. Teams and tournaments could lead to a shot at the Summer Olympics. Perchè no?\nI think this is fantastic. I played when I was a kid. Would love to be able to join a league in town.\nInteresting article, thanks. Would be great to see a bocce court installed at Blair Square near the rail trail!\n\&quot;The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\&quot;\nI think I should take some of the blame for the demise of the bocce court at Bertucci's. When it opened, my son was about 5. Bertucci's was a great place to take the kids (still is) and my son loved the bocce court, especially throwing the balls. His form wasn't as good as the pros, and occasionally, one of his throws went \&quot;out of bounds\&quot;. I suspect there were other parents who failed at juggling waiting in line and making sure the balls stayed on the bocce court. Anyway, what goes around, comes around, and the offender is now 36, and expecting his first child in a few weeks.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-25T10:18:53Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.hollistonreporter.com/article/14259/bocce-ball-is-alive-and-well-in-holliston.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A month ago, India had commissioned world’s first 100 percent solar-powered airport in Cochin. Recently, India’s greenest airport terminal at Chandigarh international airport in Mohali was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nBuilt by Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;T), the terminal, spread over 53,000 square meters, is designed in accordance with concept of green building. The terminal sets a new benchmark in sustainability by incorporating various green technologies.\nThe terminal is constructed using over 55 lakh fly ash bricks and features cavity walls, double insulated roofing, energy efficient chillers, and a sensor-based plumbing system to save water. Such an extensive use of fly ash in construction of large structure is highly commendable.\nThe terminal has achieved a 4-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) rating.\nUnlike other terminals, this does not have huge displays that run on artificial light and consume huge amount of electricity. Absence of displays has helped in cutting down maintenance costs and running expenditures.\nThe terminal does not require artificial lighting during day time owing to a transparent façade. Used glass on the façade is low-heat gain glass, which means it will automatically reduce the need for installing and spending on air conditioners.\nA lawn laid out right inside the terminal delivers a refreshing treat for passengers.\nThe available air conditioners are equipped with sensors that can detect body heat for automatic activation. Rest of the time, the ACs remain in sleep mode to save energy.\nTo meet the electricity requirements, a 200 KW solar plant is installed on the rooftop of the terminal. Solar plant generates enough energy to meet the major power needs of the building.\nFor lighting during nights, 40 percent of the airport is illuminated with energy-efficient LEDs.\nThe terminal also includes a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 600 KLD. The treatment plant is based on environment-friendly extended aeration technology. The recycled water is reused for flushing and gardening.\nThe airport terminal is one of its kind in India, may be in world too. It hasn’t received any name yet, but most likely it is to be named after Indian revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh. The new airport will facilitate neighboring states including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-24T15:02:48Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.planetcustodian.com/2015/09/25/7695/indias-greenest-airport-terminal-constructed-from-55-lakh-fly-ash-bricks.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Stately palm trees reach to the blue sky.\nThe city of Split, and majestic mountains, far off in the distance.\nLooking up from Trogir’s network of little streets.\nCheery lemons await picking, or just admirers.\nA tiny church, off in the distance.\nSilhouette of Kairos (the god of the fleeting moment), modeled after a 3rd-century bas-relief found in the town.\nThese are beautiful.

The text part of this book is only about 2%.\nThe concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.\nThe book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.\n\&quot;A secret weapon\&quot; to making a realistic human form.\nWhat sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore.

It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that.\nUnfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over.\nOh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run.\nPoor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like.

When and where did the floriculture life begin for you?\nI started in 1988 in California… another business with my Mom &amp; Sister. We were buying our flowers from local growers in Watsonville &amp; also importing from South America. We wanted to find a piece of land and begin growing our own flowers so we would have 100% control over the quality of our products. That began our search which lasted for several years until we found our beautiful land.\nWhat (or who) inspired you to raise flowers and learn to preserve the petals?\nMy grandparents always had an incredible garden. I remember when I was a very young girl just how special it was to go through the white arch of the picket fence into the back gardens and what a special occasion it always was to have access to their gardens and to be there with them… gardening, harvesting flowers &amp; the sweetest raspberries. My parents both loved gardening as well. The raising of flowers and the preservation of the petals came much later once we found our slice of paradise with our land here in Rainbow Valley, Oregon. Our property sits on the mighty South Umpqua River which is how we responsibly irrigate all of our flower fields using a drip irrigation system. This way, each crop receives the correct amount of water and none is wasted.\nDo you grow flowers other than roses?\nWe grow roses, hydrangea, peonies, lilacs… all of them are lovingly harvested by hand and carefully loaded into our specialized freeze-dry machines used to preserve the flowers and petals. Everything is done right here on our property… the growing, harvesting, processing and shipping. All done with positive energy and wonderful intentions.\nWhat do you enjoy most about the craft of drying rose petals for weddings and special events?\nHands down it is the joy of growing the flowers. We are so lucky to see this stunning beauty we create with Mother Nature’s help. We love all of the bees, the butterflies, lady bugs and the sweet floral scent that surrounds us on our land. Maybe even more importantly is how happy our flowers make all of our customers. We are so grateful for all the love they give back to us with glowing reviews, photos and more … they are incredible!\nWhat are some of the ways folks can incorporate your flower petals into their celebrations?\nThe uses for our petals are really unlimited. First thing that comes to mind is for a romantic celebration. Valentine’s day is a big one! They are used for proposals, engagement parties, save the date cards, weddings for creating or decorating the aisle, the guests to shower the blissful newlyweds with a petal toss when walking back down the aisle or for their first dance. To decorate the reception tables &amp; couples honeymoon suite, include in thank you notes, gender reveals, babies first photos. They’re also used by resorts and hotels for rose petal turndown and spa services. We have many people that use them to honor and celebrate loved ones for memorials, funerals, celebration of life events. We have had people toss from helicopters, small planes, hot air balloons, military flyovers. Several natural soap, cosmetics and bath bomb companies incorporate our petals into their products. Party &amp; home decorations, the Rose Parade every January. There are unlimited ways to include rose petals into your life… let your imagination have fun creating new ways to use them.\nWhere can your flower petals be purchased at this time?\nFreeze dried rose petals can be used in culinary projects. Have you ever done this?\nWe have made a number of items with our petals and so have many of our customers. The one that stands out the most is a company that uses our lilac petals in a special microbrew beer they blend. Now that’s creative!\nWhat resources do you find invaluable to the novice flower farmer? Do you have any tips for folks who might want to try freeze-drying their own rose petals from their gardens?\nFreeze drying utilizes highly specialized equipment which is very, very expensive. It is something you are able to do at home if you are willing to invest thousands of dollars for the small table top models. There are other methods of drying flowers, however, they will look like dried flowers verses fresh like freeze-dried petals and flowers look. Follow your heart, do what you are most passionate about. Experiment with plants, annuals, perennials, fruits &amp; veggies… you just never know what will inspire and delight you until you try it!\nWe loved hearing more about your wonderful flower farm and, putting together this post, can almost smell the gorgeous flowers!

This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.\nMETHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.\nRESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.\nCONCLUSION: TQ exhibits a regenerative potential for the treatment of damaged peripheral nerves.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-20T06:38:54Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://m.greenmedinfo.com/article/thymoquinone-exhibits-regenerative-potential-treatment-damaged-peripheral-nerv&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;– Handouts will be uploaded to the website 10 minutes before the webinar.\n– Please stay muted (turn off your microphone) during the webinar.\n– Recorded webinars will be available for course subscribers within a few days after the webinar.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-24T04:21:21Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.acupuncturemedia.com/webinars/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The page provides the exchange rate of 26402000000 Emirati Dirham (AED) to Japanese Yen (JPY), sale and conversion rate.

What's this all About?\nYou could say I grew up traveling, when I was young I lived in Lagos, Nigeria with my family. Over the years I spent there we traveled to some of the countries you see highlighted in green. During these travels I saw the pyramids of Egypt, I summited Mt. Kilimanjaro, skied in the alps, learned how to scuba dive in Mauritius, and so much more. I was very lucky in this respect, but living in West Africa exposed me to some stark realities. I quickly came to understand that the world is a harsh place to most people. The struggle for survival is something real and a part of most peoples' everyday lives.\nIt wasn't until later, that I decided to travel again. This time on my own. At the age of twenty, fed up with the mundane routine of my life, I decided to take some time off school and head south. From my home in Colorado I traveled to Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. I was interested in environmental science, ecology, and societies different from my own and this area of the world beaconed me.\nI fell in love with the culture, the people, fellow travelers and the Spanish language. I spent just a few months down there, but I left with a promise to return. After just a couple years I graduated with a degree from Colorado State University, and I fulfilled that promise. It's now been over three years of traveling and I am still living the transient life, as a writer, traveler, and outdoor guide.\nWhere will I be going next?\nThe concept of Tramp-N-Trekker is simple, its a blog about the intersect between outdoor enthusiasm and a loose footing lifestyle. Covering a wide range of topics like the cost of living abroad, backpacking meals, gear reviews, travel tips, musings from the vagabond lifestyle and my personal thoughts on all related matters. This is meant to be for anyone who wants to travel, regardless of location or duration. It is meant to inspire people to travel while offering the tips and tricks I've acquired from doing so myself. During my travels I will be backpacking into the mountains, forests and jungles of the world. Exploring iconic cities and small villages alike. Meeting new people, and doing whatever else comes my way.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-22T06:41:12Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.trampntrekker.com/about.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A PROCEDURE assessed by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and used in research led by the University of Birmingham has been hailed as an exciting development in increasing the number of livers which can be safely used for transplantation.\nLiver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for end-stage liver disease, which kills 11,000 people a year in England. Deaths from liver disease have soared by 25 per cent in a decade and continue to rise, while the average age of death from liver disease (currently 50-59 years) continues to decrease.\nToday NICE has issued final guidance which recommends the procedure — ex-vivo machine perfusion for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation — is used under special arrangements as more data is gathered into its efficacy.\nNICE’s independent advisory committee did not identify any major safety concerns.\nNHS England and commissioners will decide whether they fund the procedure. However research is already taking place at centres around the UK including studies by experts from the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research in the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre.\nUniversity of Birmingham Honorary Professor Darius Mirza, Consultant Transplant Surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said: “In the 30 years I’ve been involved with transplantation there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I’m absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practice organ storage and transplantation.\nSue Bennett, 45, a mother of three from Ranton in Staffordshire, had a liver transplant using this new technique in 2015.\nShe said: “I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn’t sleep and my quality of life was quite low.\n“Having a transplant has changed my life. I‘ve joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team.\nJohn Forsythe, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “There has been a huge amount of research in the area of preservation and perfusion methods that allow us to both assess precious donor organs and to enhance their function. This could potentially mean the organ works better and improve transplant outcomes.\n“Many of the lead researchers in the area of transplant preservation and perfusion techniques are in UK and it is good to see UK researchers continue to be at the forefront in this field.\nVanessa Hebditch, director of policy at the British Liver Trust said, “Every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease die whilst waiting for a transplant.\n“This new device offers real hope as it may improve transplant outcomes and allow livers that were previously thought to be unsuitable to be used and also increase the time that livers are able to be kept.\nFor the financial year ending 31 March 2018, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list, according to NHS Blood and Transplant.\nThe number of patients on the active transplant list reached a ten year high in 2015 when 611 patients were on the waiting list. However the large drop attributed to the 2018 figure may be due to the introduction of the National Liver Offering Scheme (NLOS) in March 2018.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-20T01:16:59Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.tamworthinformed.co.uk/perfusion-machine/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Vayam Technologies Ltd. has successfully executed Uttar Pradesh Common Services Centre project under National eGovernance Plan across Uttar Pradesh.

Focusing on extreme conditions, Wheeler has illustrated more than a half a dozen weather-related titles written by Lorraine Jean Hopping. Included in the series are Wild Weather: Blizzards, which combines historical incidents involving blizzards with facts about these massive storms and descriptions of the job of a meteorologist. Wild Weather: Lightning! includes facts about the study of lightning and its potential deadly consequences, with many maps and illustrations. Booklist's Ilene Cooper called the watercolor artwork in Wild Weather: Blizzards \&quot;effective.\&quot;\nWheeler has also teamed up with author Rosemary Wells to produce a series of books for preschoolers, with Wheeler providing the interior artwork. In Read Me a Story, little kitten Yoko knows how to read but does not tell her mother for fear that she will stop reading to her. Yoko's ability comes from a decoder ring she sent for. Finding out about Yoko's talent, the mother assures the kitten that she will keep reading to her, and, in fact, allows Yoko to read to her. School Library Journal critic Anne Knickerbocker said of Wheeler's artwork, \&quot;Each page sports a bright, color illustration that will aid beginning readers in decoding the text.\&quot;\nWheeler once told SATA: \&quot;I developed a greater than average interest in children's books at an early age, having been influenced and encouraged by my great-aunt Opal Wheeler, a prolific writer of books for young readers in the 1950s. After being trained as a fine artist and art educator, I moved to Manhattan in 1977, and eventually turned to the field of publishing. I worked as a design assistant/secretary at Dial Press in the juvenile books division for two years before establishing my own freelance illustration business in 1980. Since then, I have enjoyed working on a variety of projects ranging from picture books to educational texts and magazines, greeting cards to coloring books.\&quot;\nBooklist, May 15, 1999, Ilene Cooper, review of Wild Weather: Blizzards!, p. 1705.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-25T15:46:40Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://biography.jrank.org/pages/199/Wheeler-Jody-1952.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nIBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor.\nIBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nThe new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips.\nClusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.\nIBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.\n\&quot;For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,\&quot; Turek said. \&quot;Its an attractive proposition.\&quot;\nAMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.\nWith the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.\nOn Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.\n/zimages/3/28571.gifRead \&quot;MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade.\&quot;\nGordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.\n\&quot;Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,\&quot; said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. \&quot;Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for.\&quot;\nWhile backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.\nTurek agreed. \&quot;The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,\&quot; he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.\n\&quot;Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,\&quot; he said.\nThe Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.\nAlso included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.\nIn the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science &amp; Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-19T18:35:24Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.eweek.com/networking/ibm-takes-wraps-off-opteron-based-cluster&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Follow the pace of one of the most popular extreme sports in the world.

Our first impression was to get what we needed and get out. It was crowded boats on the hook, mooring balls, and a lot of crap tied around the area. We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala.

Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.\nLocal, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.\nBrowne, Clayton. \&quot;Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?\&quot; Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/there-marketing-jobs-government-22921.html.

Excuse my English, I'm from Argentina, I speak Spanish. Can you be a little clearer? I do not understand why I do not handle my English very well. Thank you!\nHello, I am new to this forum. I've been able to modify the app manifest to install on the sd card, grant read/write permission, and mount/unmount file systems. I couldn't quite find the other permissions that were suggested. Also, do you mind elaborating on how to do this? Or which app could be used to do so?\nThanks! But it finally makes sense now. \&quot;Access denied\&quot; must come up whenever trying to run a program that isn't compiled for ARM. I was able to copy and paste the wine iexplorer.exe file into my phone's Download folder, and it ran fine from there.

Throwing them at things, building card castles with them, and playing games with them. Perhaps you have a kid like this. What? No, not a kid posing rhetorical questions about individualism, a kid who likes cards.\nIf you do have a kid like this, well then we have the perfect outfit for them.

I’ve been nominated me for a Liebster blogging award. This is an award that’s given to new bloggers as a way to recognize &amp; encourage them in their work.\nAyanna over at 21 Flavors of Splendor has nominated me for this award, and I couldn’t be more grateful. I’ve been following Ayanna, pretty much since I started blogging. She’s always been encouraging and this nomination is just further proof of that. Head over to check out her blog, oh and her Instagram is one full of encouragement and fun peaks into her everyday!\nAnother blog that I really love is Rachael’s over at Oh Lord Help Us. This is a woman sharing her faith and sharing her resources. It’s clear from the moment you enter the world of her blog, she’s looking to be real, have real conversation, and share her real learning. In addition to her blog, she’s also making some pretty sweet jewelry pieces. And as if that weren’t enough, she’s donating the proceeds from sales to invest back in her ministry to share Gods truth with woman of faith to know who they were created to be. This is a ministry and blog that will encourage women to live to their full potential as strong and fierce daughters of God. Check her out over at her blog, Instagram or any of her social media accounts. She’s always dishing out some encouragement.\nThe rules of this nomination encourage each blogger to share some randomness about ourselves. This is such a fun way to get to know each other a little better. So here we go!\nI often make myself giggle. I’m the funniest person I know. Kidding..a little!\nI’ve watched “The Office” and embarrassing number of times, I could probably quote the entire series.\nMy family and I speak fluent movie quotes…it keeps things interesting!\nI typically eat all the snacks after my kids are asleep, then claim to have no idea what happened to them. NO SELF CONTROL!\nSome more encouraged fun is answering questions from the person who nominated you, and posing 10 of your own for your nominations to answer on their website. Ayanna asked some really good ones, check them out below.\nI started blogging as a creative outlet. At first, I was into the thrill of learning the in’s and out’s of the process. Then I realized, I had a voice, actual things to say that could help others. This is why I continue to blog.\nThe name of my website perfectly describes the main themes of my life. We’re a family totally dependent of God’s grace to make it through the struggles of everyday life. Giggling is how we keep sane!\nItaly, definitely Italy! Or maybe Main, I hear they have the most amazing Autumn seasons.\nWhat is your favorite fiction book?\nIs it bad that I don’t have one? I’m not much of a reader. Lately my reading is mostly of other’s blogs. I’ve been learning so much from my blogging buddies, and have gained new perspectives.\nNew friends! Admittedly, I’m not a social media person at all. In fact before my blog, I had almost no presence on any of it. Since I started blogging, I’ve made many friends all around the globe and have joined in prayer, joys, and sorrows with them.\nIf you could meet any person, who is still alive, who would it be and why?\nI had to really think about this one, but here’s who I came up with…ANY MISSIONARY. I know that God has me tethered to my current place, so I often look in amazement at folks who are picking up and moving out all in an effort to further the Kingdom of heaven and help as many people as possible. It’s a pretty interesting calling and life to lead.\nCoffee &amp; my Bible. I know that’s two things, but it measures up to one good morning.\nIf you could eat one food every day and not worry about the calories, what would it be?\nIce cream, with tons of stuff in it. I love stuff, any stuff, in my ice cream!\nWhat do you see happening on your blog in year 5?\nI’ve started praying for God to use my website as a way to lift others, and to connect a body of of like minded people to encourage each other and share life stories. I’m letting God lead me at this point, I’m willing to turn in any direction He leads me to.\nWhat’s your favorite activity (outside of blogging, of course!)?\nWhat’s the one T.V. show that you hope(d) never goes (went) off the air?\nIf you were to start a charity, who would it benefit?\nAre you a morning person? If so, please help me with some tips!\nWhat’s one piece of advice you can give to new bloggers?\nWhat’s you favorite social media platform?\nWhat are some goals you have for your website?\nLadies, I’m so excited to read all the answers to these questions! Have fun with your answers.\nThank you again to Ayanna, who gave me this opportunity to not only share more about myself, but to keep this recognition train rolling.\nThank the person who nominated you, and post a link to their blog on your blog.\nDisplay the award on your blog — by including it in your post, or by having it as the feature image.\nWrite a 150-300 word post about your favorite blog that is not your own. Explain why you like the blog, provide links.\nProvide 10 random facts about yourself.\nAnswer the questions from your nominator.\nNominate 5 – 11 blogs that you feel deserve the award, who have less than 200 followers.\nAsk your nominees questions of your own.\nJesus really is the reason-Sorry Santa!\nWelcome to this space on the world wide web I’ve carved out for faith, family, food &amp; funnies. Here I’m sharing all the things that bring me joy.\nI didn’t always know God, but this much I do know, He’s always been with me. I’m so sure that God intended for us to share with each other for the sake of community &amp; encouragement. So for that reason, I’m laying out for you all that I’m learning.\nOh, and I have the privilege of bringing you the testimonies of some serious God loving women!\nFeel free to jump in, leave comments &amp; share along with us.\n(c) 2016 - All Rights Reserved.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-19T04:17:27Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.withgigglesandgrace.com/first-award-recognition-liebster-award/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:50,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Installed correctly including ASPI file.

Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease.\nIts actual causing reason is still unknown.

From December 1 to December 12, citizens can donate items in their own neighborhoods or at local participating businesses to help neighbors in need.\nThe Food Elves is a charitable community service group made up of more than 60 students ranging from elementary through high school. For the past two years they have joined forces with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to operate the “12 Days of Donating” campaign with great success. This year the Elves aim to beat last year’s record-breaking collection drive by raising more than $5,700 and 4,200 pounds of goods.\nAccording to the Food Pantry, about 600 households are registered to use Pantry services. This year’s need will be even greater due to a decrease in SNAP benefits in November. Health and hygiene items are not covered by those benefits and are a particular need.\nIn early December, Food Elves will notify their neighbors about the collection campaign, including what items can be collected and the collection dates. Residents simply place bags of goods at their mailboxes on the designated pickup day and the Elves will do the rest. Collection dates will be Saturday, December 7, Sunday, December 8, or Saturday, December 14.\nIn case there’s no Elf in your neighborhood, it is still easy to donate. The Elves have placed bright red collection bins at participating Downtown Partnership member businesses. If the Elves meet their goal of collecting more than 1,200 pounds of goods, each business has pledged to donate $200. There will be a donation bin at the Holiday Stroll tree lighting ceremony at Dean College on Thursday, December 5, or you can drop off donations at the Food Pantry, 43 West Central St., and designate them for the “12 Days of Donating” drive.\nDCU, 500 West Central St.\nDean Bank, 21 Main St.\nEmma’s Quilt Cupboard, 12 Main St.\nFranklin Downtown Partnership Office, 9 East Central St.\nJane’s Frames, 11 East Central St.\nMurphy Business, 15 East Central St.\nPour Richard’s Wine &amp; Spirits, 14 Grove St.\nColin and CJ Berg; Gabbie Blood; Malik, Hatim, Suhail and Nasir Brahimi; Julia and Katie Buccella; Cara and Chris Callahan; Sarah Carroll; Austin and Carter Castillo; Avery and Erin Chalk; Allie Champlin; Gillian Cristiano; Karen Cunningham; Jacob and Julia Dextradeur; Ryan Dombroski; Brendan Donaghey; Jamie Dragsbaek; Adam Duval; Kaleigh, Abby, Megan and Maddie Egan; Griffin and John Fenton; Haley Frank; Megan Georges; Alexa Katsaros; Maddie Lacman; Nicolette McCarthy; Kyle Neenan; Connor O’Brian; Cameron Piana; Dylan, Kaitlyn, Lindsey and Sydney Rappa; Ashley and Taylor Reutlinger; Sara Richardson; Aubree, Cassi and Corey Ronan; Abby, Chloe and Cooper Ross; Emily Shea; Jake Signo; Cam and Evan Strouse; Ellie and Katie Teixeira; Ben and Dan Weiss.\nFor more information about the Franklin Food Elves and the “12 Days of Donating” campaign, please contact the Franklin Downtown Partnership at (774)571-3109 or downtown.franklin@yahoo.com.

Follow the consulate on Facebook.\nAs with each edition, this month’s included a spotlight on Belgian living and working in the consulate’s jurisdiction. Known as “The Belgian in the Picture,” the series aims to show just how deeply impactful the country’s economic and cultural engagement with the South is, despite its small size. The below Q&amp;A is reprinted with permission and has been lightly edited for clarity and style.\nBelgian Consulate: Paul De Sloover, a veteran Belgian entrepreneur in the U.S., is being spotlighted in this month’s newsletter — appropriated given that his latest venture provides an innovative way to generate power from the sun. Mr. De Sloover, can you tell us more about the solar roof tiles made by Desol Power Tiles?\nMr. de Sloover: Solar roof tiles are roof tiles with integrated solar panels. Instead of installing unsightly solar panels on top of an existing roof, with DeSol Power Tiles it is your roof itself that captures the sunlight. The tiles themselves look like regular classic Nordic style roof tiles, and when installed as instructed they form a completely sealed, walkable and hurricane-resistant roof.\nBelgian Consulate: What are other reasons more people are choosing solar roof tiles rather than solar panels?\nMr. de Sloover: An issue a lot of people run into when they consider turning to solar energy, is that most home owners’ associations don’t accept the looks of large solar panels. Because our solar roof tiles don’t affect the aesthetic or architectural appeal of the roof, it removes that hurdle entirely.\nBelgian Consulate: With 31 years of experience as an entrepreneur in the U.S., what is your favorite aspect of doing business here?\nMr. de Sloover: I would have to say the easy access to people and institutions, and the willingness of people to inform and help you in what you want to realize. And, of course, the advantages of the sheer size of the market and having unified regulations in that one big market. That is a definite advantage compared to Europe where every country has different regulations regarding solar roof tiles.\nBelgian Consulate: What would you tell a budding Belgian entrepreneur dreaming of taking his chances in the U.S.?\nMr. de Sloover: Don’t dream, act. America, the United States, is a very open country. Spend time going to business fairs and talking to professional people. Do not assume that what works in Belgium will work in the States. Do your research.\nBelgian Consulate: How do you see the future of eco-friendly energy in the US?\nMr. de Sloover: At this point there are two different schools of thought. Part of the people want to keep everything the way it is, and the other group of people wants renewable energy. Recent polls show that 73 percent of the American population believes in renewable energy. It will take time to get there, because this country, the United States, has an abundance of fossil fuels in its soil. But it also has an abundance of sunshine. So I would say, the future is bright.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-18T12:35:39Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.globalatlanta.com/qa-rooftop-solar-without-the-panels-a-belgian-entrepreneurs-bright-view-on-the-future-of-renewables/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Lease for $78 a month!

Growing specialization and diversification have brought a host of monographs and textbooks on increasingly specialized topics. However, the \&quot;tree\&quot; of knowledge of mathematics and related fields does not grow only by putting forth new branches. It also happens, quite often in fact, that branches which were thought to be completely disparate are suddenly seen to be related. Further, the kind and level of sophistication of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years: measure theory is used (non- trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And in addition to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as \&quot;experimental mathematics\&quot;, \&quot;CFD\&quot;, \&quot;completely integrable systems\&quot;, \&quot;chaos, synergetics and large-scale order\&quot;, which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes. They draw upon widely different sections of mathematics.\nSelf-Organization and Information Theory.- The Mathematics Needed for Self-Organisation.- Entropy and Order.- Pattern Formation for a One Dimensional Evolution Equation Based on Thom's River Basin Model.- On the Modelling of Vehicular Traffic Flow.- Alternative Exploitation of Dissipation Inequality Demonstrated for Hyperbolic Heat Conduction.- A New Approach to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes by Means of Lagrange-Formalism.- A Boundary-Layer Theory for the Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Phase-Interfaces.- Large Scale Magnetic Fields in Fluids - An Example of a Dissipative Structure.- Facing Some Problems with Entropy.- On the Spontaneous Emission from Two-Level Atoms in a Damped Cavity.- Polynucleotides - A Class of Self-Organizing Biomolecules.- Stages of Emerging Life - Five Principles of Early Organization.- The Physical Matrix for Self-Organisation.- Spontaneously Broken Symmetries and Dissipative Structures.- On the Coherence of Ultraweak Photonemission from Living Tissues.- Evolution: Natural Selection or Self-Organization?.- Thermodynamics and Complex Systems.- The Transition from Town to City: Metropolitan Behaviour in the 19th Century.- Creation, Organisation and Preservation of Dissipative Structures.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-21T17:12:43Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.booktopia.com.au/disequilibrium-and-self-organisation-c-w-kilmister/prod9789027723000.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:82,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I always love a good nosey into people’s bags – it kind of shows you a little bit more of their personality.

That being said, pro-sumer Digital SLR cameras as well as full Professional SLR cameras use CompactFlash as it seems to be more reliable and is certainly faster when it comes to continuous write speeds. Today we are taking a look at a very expensive 16GB card from SanDisk that is from their flagship line – the Extreme Pro. These cards claim to have a write speed of up to 90MB/sec – making them some of the fastest flash cards to ever hit the general public. How much will this set you back? SanDisk lists the MSRP at a mere $335.99USD currently. Before you choke and run away, let’s take a look and see if this price tag is justified in any way, shape or form.\nFounded in 1988 by Dr. Eli Harari, an internationally recognized authority on non-volatile memory technology, SanDisk has grown to become the world’s largest supplier of innovative flash memory data storage products.\nSanDisk currently has more than 1,100 U.S. patents, more than 600 foreign patents, and more than 1440 patent applications pending in the U.S. SanDisk is the only company, worldwide, that has the rights to both manufacture and sell every major flash card format, including CompactFlash®, SD™, miniSD™, microSD™, MultiMediaCard™, Reduced Size MultiMediaCard (RS-MMC™), Memory Stick PRO™ and related Memory Stick® products, xD-Picture Card™ and USB flash drives.\nSanDisk became a publicly traded company (NASDAQ:SNDK) in November 1995, and in 2008 revenues were 3.3 billion. With more than 3,400 employees worldwide, SanDisk is headquartered in Milpitas, California.\nMy interest in a fast CompactFlash card was recently piqued when I picked up a Nikon D300s DSLR. This card uses both SD and CF media and you can specify which picture format gets stored on each card. Normally I take pictures and save them lossless as RAW (NEF) as well as JPG. I love the convenience of the Eye-Fi SD card for uploading my pictures to Flickr and to my computer and it is nice to have all the RAW files stored on a separate card. The problem is that each RAW image is over 9MB and the camera takes up to 8FPS with a battery grip. It doesn’t take long to fill the buffer and start slowing the camera down.\nThe Extreme Pro series of CompactFlash cards come in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB capacities and can cost you almost $900 for the 64GB version. These cards are not for the weak of heart, but they do offer a nice bunch of features.\nThe following information has been pulled from the SanDisk product page and posted here for your convenience.\nNow there’s a memory card fast enough to keep up with your advanced DSLR: The SanDisk Extreme® Pro™ CompactFlash® card. With lightning-fast (up to 90 MB/s* read/write) speed, you’ll be able to capture more continuous burst shooting-and get the most out of your professional digital SLR camera. And with up to 64GB** of storage, you’ll be ready for more RAW+JPEG and high-def video.\nSanDisk engineered its Power Core™ Controller to take whatever your camera’s buffer can dish out. By distributing image data across the card more rapidly and efficiently, this card delivers professional performance.\nPOWER CORE CONTROLLERTM &amp; ENHANCED SUPER-PARALLEL PROCESSINGTM “ESP”: Was invented by SanDisk to increase the card’s performance level.\nOn the next page we’ll take a look at this cards performance in our camera and on our computer.\nFor this review we used the speedy Addonics ADSACF-N SATA CompactFlash card reader . This device supports UDMA enabled CompactFlash cards and is about the fastest CompactFlash card reader we could get our hands on with short notice. Some Firewire 800 card readers are available as well and they should certainly push the limits of this card. As previously mentioned, we also used a Nikon D300s DSLR camera that shoots in continuous mode at 7FPS with the built-in battery and up to 8FPS with the additional MB-D10 battery pack. For this review we used the MB-D10 battery grip in order to push the limits of this card.\nFor comparison in both HDTach as well as the actual camera tests, we compared the SanDisk Extreme Pro 600x card with an affordable Lexar 8GB 80x card. Obviously the difference should be obvious, but it is interesting to see how much difference there is in the real world.\nWhile the Extreme Pro supports UDMA 6 (Ultra ATA/133), the Addonics Card Reader only supports UDMA 5 (Ultra ATA/100). This is still faster than any built-in USB card reader on your laptop or desktop computer and HDTach should show some interesting performance.\nWe start things off with a look at HDTach and compare the Lexar 8GB 80x card against the SanDisk 16GB 600x card. As you can see read performance is taken care of by the SanDisk card. It doesn’t come close to its 90MB/sec speed, but it does burst to over 67MB/sec and averages 34.6MB/sec read speed. Compare this to the Lexar card which bursts to 15.9MB/sec and averages a 15.6MB/sec read speed.\nWith those numbers in mind, we popped these cards into the D300s and started clicking. We shot images in bright daylight at 1/200 shutter speed at ISO100, with no noise reduction. The Tokina 11-16mm lens was set at f2.8 and we ran through a couple of tests. The first test was to see how fast the camera could fill the buffer and once it was full, we’d take two more frames to get our first result. In RAW mode, the images at 4288×2848 and were averaging about 9.28MB in size. The SanDisk card shot 20 images in exactly 3 seconds. The buffer filled at about 18 images and we snapped a couple more for a realistic result. The Lexar card started out pretty good, but when the buffer filled, it slowed down to a crawl as it couldn’t write data very fast. We took 19 images in 5 seconds with this card.\nOnce we did the initial speed test, we timed out how long it took to take 30 images. Once again we started out with the SanDisk Extreme Pro and we took 30 images in 5 seconds flat. That works out to six images per second – including the time it take to write to the card once the buffer is full. The Lexar card took 19 seconds to snap the same 30 image set. The first 17 were very fast, but the next images were painfully slow.\nThe above information doesn’t really indicate actual write speed as the camera buffer is holding 17 images and writing as fast as possible. The reality is that you can continue to shoot 5 images per second while the SanDisk card is writing data and the Lexar card takes over a second to write a single image. The Lexar card is more than 6x slower in the real world.\nWhile I’m sure that most people wouldn’t consider spending $250+ on a 16GB CompactFlash Card, if you’re a budding photographer and you just have to capture that action shot to get your big break, the SanDisk Extreme Pro card won’t leave you waiting. It writes incredibly fast, reads data from the card in a snap and worked flawlessly through the weeks that we pounded this card in our tests. We used it in low temperatures -10C without issues and I’m confident that this card will keep on kicking long after your SD cards have corrupted. In the D300s, I used it to record my RAW images and sent the JPEGs to an SD card and this convenience and performance is fantastic.\nThe bottom line is this: “Would I spend $250 on this card?” I wish I had $250 to spend on it as it gives you the freedom to shoot as much as you need to without worrying about slowing down your camera considerably while the card writes images from the buffer. The performance you gain from this card is remarkable – if you have a fast camera – but you’ll have to decide if the performance is worth the price. This makes it hard to score value – as it is extremely expensive for 16GB of storage, but for the speed it is priced not too badly.\nIf you’re even considering this card, you probably have over $2000 worth of camera kit hanging around your neck and this would only represent about 10% of your investment. If you look at it that way, it’s probably not a bad buy.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-22T16:47:12Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://benheide.com/sandisk-16gb-extreme-pro-compactflash-review/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ENVASS prescribes to various environmental legal newsletters from large and accountable legal firms in South Africa.

Read on for today’s interview with Susan Dorson &amp; Amy Weitzman, two local moms on a mission to save their community library and provide parents with an eco-friendly, affordable shopping option via The Little Fox Shop. Then go ahead and nominate yourself or a friend!\nChristine: Welcome, Susan and Amy! You were nominated for this feature because of the work you have done to start The Little Fox Shop at the Edith Fox Branch Library in East Arlington, where all proceeds go to support the library (whose doors have been on the verge of closing for some time due to budget cuts). Now, everyone (present company included) talks about the importance of preserving local libraries, but your efforts truly walk the walk. What inspired you to action to help save the Fox Branch?\nSusan: I have always loved the Fox Library but when I was pregnant with my first son, I would take daily walks up to the Fox and chat with the librarians and it became a part of my life. After my son was born, there were days when I was very lonely but I knew that my local library was a place I could find people to talk to - and of course books. The thing about a branch library is that it is more than just a place to get books; it is a community gathering place. Owing in part to the smaller population that the Fox serves, you can see the same faces each week, you can network and go to events, and it becomes central to your life. I couldn't see this taken away from me, my children, or my neighborhood. The main branch is wonderful but to be able to walk into a place and have everybody know your name....well, that's special.\nAmy: When Susan asked me be to part of a new children's secondhand store inside the library, I didn't hesitate to join her. I have always loved libraries and seriously considered becoming a school librarian a few years ago, but was disheartened when I saw that librarian positions were being eliminated at many schools around the country. Running the shop to save my local library seemed like the next best thing to me. Susan informed me that Arlington elementary schools no longer have librarians. The Fox Library will be the best way for my children to access the wealth of knowledge that librarians have on children's books and reading. That really motivated me. Also, the recycling aspect of the Little Fox is tremendously important to both Susan and me. When you buy a recycled item from the Little Fox instead of new from another store, the earth smiles.\nChristine:How difficult was it to get this effort going? What was the rough timetable from conception to opening? Did the town of Arlington help with startup funds to spruce up the space and get your website going or was it all pieced together through friends and family? Some combination of both?\nSusan &amp; Amy: Getting the Little Fox started took a lot of thinking and planning. The time from conception to opening was about 8 weeks. One of our most important goals was to create an atmosphere in which people would enjoy shopping and volunteering. We didn't receive any funds from the town, but they gave us the space and free reign over it. Almost nothing in the shop was purchased new. One of us would spy a good shelf on the curb for trash and haul it over to the shop. We would have \&quot;pizza night\&quot; at the store and our husbands and children would come and they would play while we worked. Friends would come with us to the shop and help us get ready for the opening as well. Susan has a really good eye for store design and has done most of the arranging and decorating of our physical space. Amy worked in advertising and software development before she had children, so she was able to create our website and organizes our online schedule of volunteers. Our different skill sets compliment each other very well.\nOne of the inspirations for the Little Fox was the PTO Thrift Store, which operated in the basement of the Fox Library for four years. It was a great success and many people in Arlington were sad to see it closing. They sold anything and everything, but we love and need kid stuff and decided to focus exclusively on children's items. We opened the same month the PTO Thrift Store closed, and they generously gave us many of their racks and shelving. Also, the librarians at both the Fox and Robbins Libraries have been wonderfully helpful and supportive.\nChristine: What used to live in the space where The Little Fox shop now resides? Did you take before and after photos? From a design perspective, what transformed the space from (presumably) dingy storage space to what your nominator called a “hip thrift shop”?\nSusan &amp; Amy: The space most recently held the Arlington Early Intervention program, which moved about a year ago. I don't think we have any before pictures, but it wasn't very appealing when we took over the space. While we wanted to repaint the entire space, that was one thing were weren't allowed to do, so it was all about distracting the eye from the beat-up beige walls; we used paintings, colorful decorations that hang from the wall and ceiling, and the items we are selling tend to come in bold, bright colors so that helps, too. We put stuffed animals out as decorations and created a clothesline on our most prominent wall to display seasonal items; right now we have Halloween costumes on that wall.\nChristine: You sell kids' clothing, toys, baby gear, and maternity clothes. What have been some of your favorite, most amazing finds to walk in the door?\nAmy: It's funny, the best \&quot;finds\&quot; are very personal. I love stuffed animals that are characters from books and get excited when a new one comes in, like Madeline or Snoopy.\nSusan: I love when great gear shows up, like an almost new jogging stroller or a highly sought after Bumbo seat. I also get very excited about great books and particularly cute girls clothes (as I have two boys, I enjoy the chance to see all of the great girls things)! We recently got a Thomas Train table and I am waiting to see how long that will last.\nChristine: Your nominator wrote, “Since opening this summer, Amy and Susan have opened a beautiful retail space, organized a small army of volunteers, and raised over $7,000!” Are you aware of what that money actually funds (e.g., staff, longer library hours, utilities, etc.)? Meaning, roughly, what does it take to keep a small but thriving branch library open for business?\nSusan &amp; Amy: The library costs approximately $90,000 per year to operate, although closing it wouldn't save the town nearly that much, as most of the salary costs of the senior staff positions would simply be transferred to the cost of operating the main library. Our goal is to raise enough money to keep the town from considering The Fox a liability.\nChristine: Clearly, your efforts are paying off and the shop is growing. Where are your greatest areas of need for volunteers? How can people get involved to help? What kind of commitment is involved?\nSusan &amp; Amy: We are constantly amazed at the quality and dedication of our volunteers, but we can always use more. Since many of the volunteers who run the shop are also moms, their availability can change at a moment's notice; when something in their household changes, whether it is a shift in childcare arrangements or a new job for themselves or their partner. We also have a few retired people working at the shop and they are a great help since they are able to work hours that are difficult for those with young families to volunteer (like pickup time at the elementary schools). Working at the Little Fox is fun! If you worked retail as a young person, running the register can bring back memories. For retired people, the Little Fox can be a low-key workplace and a place to socialize. Our volunteers work as little as once a month for a couple of hours or 2-3 hours each week; it's completely up to them. See the volunteer page of our website for more information on volunteering at the shop.\nChristine: You’re both mothers of two children. How do you juggle your efforts with The Little Fox Shop with parenting? Do your children come to work with you?\nSusan &amp; Amy: Susan often brings her children to the store while she works. Sometimes she lets them borrow books or small toys from the shop as an incentive, but most of the time they are happy to be there since it's a toy store where they can play with all of the toys! Amy is able to work in the store with her older daughter who is 4 1/2, but not very well with her younger girl, who is 18 months old (she likes to wander out the door)! Amy's husband works at home, so she often runs over to the store during her younger daughter's nap or works the evening shift on Wednesday while her husband makes dinner and puts the kids to bed. The summer was a challenging time to start the store since our kids were home with us full-time, but now that we have volunteers running the store much of the time, things have gotten much easier for us and our families. And it helps that we both live within walking distance of the store.\nChristine: I truly find your efforts so commendable and I wonder whether one or both of you have strong roots in community service. Is this work part of a long history of helping others?\nSusan &amp; Amy: We definitely love to help others. Susan's background is in Macro Social Work, which means working with groups and populations on issues that they face; one facet of that is community organizing of which there is a strong element at the Little Fox. For the past 2 years, Amy has been running the Arlington Parents List, an email list with over 1500 local parents. Before that, she taught a basic computer skills class for low-income mothers. We also have a strong interest in recycling, and the fact that we are helping families to reuse and recycle is important to us.\nChristine: We’ve talked exclusively about The Little Fox Shop until now. We’d love to know more about you both; give us a snapshot of your history and interests.\nSusan: A snapshot of my history? That is tough. OK, very quick. I grew up the daughter of two ministers learning about helping to give to our community and protecting our world. In college I majored in psychology and then afterwards worked in children's theater with a focus on social issues. As I said before, my graduate degree is in Macro Social Work (from BU). My interests are making everything around me better....maybe that is too ambitious?! In reality I love to read, camp, bike, and go on adventure with my family. I love to be challenged and am relishing my experiences in starting a non-profit!\nAmy: I grew up in Texas and California, but came to Boston as a freshman at BU. I majored in English Literature but added a Computer Science minor at the last minute so I'd be able to find a job when I graduated! My husband and I love to travel and have tried to continue to explore the world, even though we now take up more than one row on an airplane. I enjoy making paper collage and reading crafty blogs. I also have been known to stay up half the night reading a book. Text the word \&quot;novel\&quot; to the number 41411 to get a list of my favorite books. Try it, it really works!\nSusan: As a Boston mama I love the fact that there is so much to do. I can take my children to festivals, fairs, concerts, and museums or just bike on the Esplanade, sail on lakes and rivers, or explore the parks. If you can't find something to do or somewhere to go, you simply aren't trying hard enough!\nAmy: Playgrounds and sandwiches. I'm not kidding, Boston has the best sandwiches. We love to get a great sandwich and eat it while the kids play at the playground. Most of our favorite places for sandwiches are in Cambridge, but we have been known to get a pizza and walk to Spy Pond right here in Arlington and watch the sun go down as the girls play with stones on the edge of the water.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-24T10:21:49Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.bostonmamas.com/blog/2008/10/28/featured-mamas-susan-dorson-amy-weitzman.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:90,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;MIDDLETOWN, NJ - The Middletown Township Public Library and the Township of Middletown are pleased to announce the appointment of Kim Rinaldi as Provisional Library Director, beginning on February 24, 2014.

The most common ATPases (24 proteins) contain the classical mononucleotide-binding motif, which is known as the P-loop or Walkermotif. A second subfamily exists as the GHL ATPase family, including Hsp90, PMS2, MutL and DNA gyrase B, and share the same left-handed β-α-β-fold. Four conserved sequence motifs have been identified in these enzymes. Finally, β-actin, Hsp70 and FtsA contain a more complex nucleotide-binding site and form the third and last subfamily of ATPases. The presence of various types of nucleotide-binding site in ATPases is of interest for drug discovery, as it might allow the design of compounds that specifically target only one type.\nThe class of Heat-shock proteins (Hsps; EC 3.6.-.-), the molecular chaperones, comprises five major and broadly conserved families: Hsp100s, Hsp90s, Hsp70s, Hsp60s, and small heat shock proteins (sHsps). The stress proteins are typically named after their molecular size in kilodaltons. They are required for the correct folding and maintenance of client proteins in biologically active conformations, and to stabilize them against heat stress and toxic chemicals (particularly heavy metals). Although Hsps are ubiquitously expressed proteins, increased expression of Hsps in a stressed cell is mediated primarily by so-called heat shock transcription factors (HSFs, 1-4). Hsps bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and ATP hydrolysis is required for its function, and is the key driving force for conformational conversions within the chaperone. Although inactive heat shock proteins exhibit weak to nonexistent ATPase activity, the presence of a substrate peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsps, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis,. In addition, a variety of co-chaperones, immunophilins, and other proteins are involved in the Hsp90-mediated protein folding pathway.\n ATPases as drug targets: learning from their structure. P.

The price of the kit includes 1 Litre of our Palladium Tank Plating Solution which contains 6 grams of palladium per litre and can be shipped outside the UK and EU, making it a good substitute for our transport restricted rhodium and platinum plating processes.\nOur Palladium Tank Plating Solution deposits a bright white, hard-wearing layer of palladium and is an excellent alternative to rhodium for re-plating white gold wedding and engagement rings. Another notable feature of our palladium plating system is that you can safely palladium plate items of jewellery that include materials such as pearl or coral without having to mask them out, as our Palladium Tank Plating Solution will not etch materials made from calcium carbonate. This was the case with the pearl and silver pendant in the picture; the whole of the pendant, pearls included, was immersed in our Palladium Plating Solution without any negative effect on the pearls. For a guide to setting up your Palladium Tank Plating Kit you can follow the same instructions for our Rhodium Tank Plating Kit which can be found in our Electroplating Manual by clicking HERE.\nThis kit (or any of our other kits, equipment or solutions) is not suitable for plating on to aluminium or titanium and therefore can’t be used to plate iPhones and other similar products. If you are planning on palladium tank plating on to copper and its alloys including brass and bronze you’ll need to brush plate a barrier layer of gold flash to protect your tank plating solution.\nIn between uses of your palladium tank plating solution, it’s a good idea to cover your solution with cling film to stop particles of duct and hair getting in as this will over time shorten the life of your solution. It will also reduce the frequency of having to filter your solution.\nStepped voltage controlled via a selector switch enabling a range from 3 up to 12 volts. Maximum current is 3.0 amps. Perfect for powering the cleaning stage, removing the need to re-set the settings on your MF Rectifier from cleaning to plating.\nPalladium plating solution is agitated with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the beaker during plating. Mechanical agitation is a safer alternative to air agitation, as it eradicates any risk of the aerosol effect of the rhodium tank plating solution. Mechanical agitation keeps the plating solution moving over the surface of the item being plated in a consistent way, again maximising the efficiency of the tank plating process. Mechanical agitation avoids unnecessary oxidisation of the metal plating solution that air agitation will cause.\nMade bespoke from solid stainless steel and designed to be used in conjunction with the Plating Arm Clamp Fully conductive. Will not corrode and contaminate palladium tank plating solution. When used with clamp, can be moved up or down the stand in any position to fit any size of plating beaker.\nThe advertised kit is using the 250ml kit. If you want to upsize to the 1 litre kit, you will need to remove the 250ml Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 250ml Beaker, Stirring Bar (Mini) and 250ml of Palladium Tank Plating Solution from the kit list.\nYou will then need to add the 1 Litre Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 1 Beaker, Stirring Bar (Medium) and 1 litre of Palladium Tank Plating Solution.&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-23T04:01:21Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.goldn.co.uk/product/palladium-tank-plating-kit-1-litre/&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Star Wars fans were introduced to Chris Pirillo when he hilariously debuted the Hasbro Millennium Falcon on Lucasfilm’s “Force Friday” 18-hour marathon livestream.\nWe talk completing vintage collections, how Episodes VIII and IX will affect our The Force Awakens reviews and get into a passionate chat about why trolls troll.\nYOU CAN HELP “Steele Wars” with a sweet five-star review on iTunes or plug the show on Facebook or Twitter.

Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts.\nThis is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have \&quot;the right stuff.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2019-04-19T20:37:34Z&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://reviews.filmintuition.com/2008/08/fly-me-to-moon-2008.html&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There is a lot of discussion right now about stress reduction. Today we see an increased work load of mental health professionals, increased occurrences of abuse or violence faced by social workers and other therapists, and the terrible struggles facing our returning veterans. All of these things have increased our awareness of the stressful elements of our society and the impact those elements have on both our clients and the professionals whose job it is to help.\nAs a social worker I am aware of the impact of work related stress on me, my family and my ability to do my job effectively. In my exploration of this topic, I found the blog of a young British social worker who wrote a blog called “Fighting Monsters.” She has since closed the blog, for personal reasons she did not disclose. But I was very struck by the quote she references while explaining the name of her blog.\n“Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.” Nietzsche.\nFor her that was about the monster “mental disorder and illness.” For me it applies to all of the various ways we want to help and give care. If we don’t pay attention, we will fall into the very trap we are trying to help our clients climb out of. Stress, anxiety and depression are the most common warnings of the beginning fall. As professionals who work to support clients facing any number of difficult challenges, we need to be sure we have the appropriate tools to manage stress. But knowing stress is a problem and doing something about it are frequently two different things. It’s a bit of the forest from the trees problem. When we are standing in the middle of the stress we really think we are handling it quite well. If we can step back a few steps, we frequently find that we are doing a pretty poor job of it.\nThe most amazing part of this discussion, is that everything we use when we talk with clients are things that are available to us as professionals – and vice versa. Everything we talk about in these articles on stress are important for clients and therapists alike. There are four important elements in any stress management approach – TALK, WRITE, THINK, MOVE.

Despite paramedics best efforts, Marta, who was originally from Poland, was pronounced dead at the scene.
Kent and Medway Coroners office have confirmed an inquest into her death will open on Wednesday (February 27).
Tributes to the mum were left at the scene and on social media.
Friend, Jodi Cahill posted on Facebook: "I will certainly remember you. I am sorry we did not see how lost and alone you felt.
"Be at peace dear Marta."
A floral tribute left at the scene said goodbye to the "beautiful and kind soul".
It read: "To a beautiful and kind soul, we are sorry we didn&amp;apos;t see your pain. We will miss you always.
"Rest in peace Marta, Love from Lorraine, Colin and family."
The inquest will take place at the Archbishop&amp;apos;s Palace in Maidstone and will examine the circumstances surrounding Mrs Kendle&amp;apos;s death.

Mrs Kendle&amp;apos;s death prompted the setting up of a petition calling for higher railings along the Gracious Lane bridge by Sevenoaks Common - to prevent people falling and to protect drivers from below.
By today (February 25) 4,500 people had signed.
The same site was the scene of another death in July last year when Southborough woman, Angela Skinner, 54, also died after falling on to the A21.</span></div></div>

Doubtless the kopete people would disagree with me here, but I'd say that their project was utterly redundant. What advantages does kopete bring that could not have been submitted to gaim itself? Why go to the time and effort to independently develop two programs which do virtually the same thing?
Now there are other, significant differences. Gaim uses the GTK+ toolkit. Kopete uses Qt. Gaim is primarily C, Kopete is C++. In fact Kopete is fairly tightly bounded to KDE, whereas I think Gaim is not so quite involved with Gnome.
So we can reduce this redundancy problem to the problem of two desktops, if it is a problem. I'm not sure it is, after all competition is good and drives development. Is it that much of a problem that some coders have spent time and effort re-inventing the wheel anyway?
Well I think it is a problem, unless you are heavily camped in either desktop. I'm not. When I develop a GUI application, I have to make a decision about which environment suits me best. I know there's more to it than that - Gnome has all that other stuff like Glib and KDE isn't just QT - but the GUI is a major consideration.
So if I opt for (say) GTK+, will some QT zealot prefer to code an alternative to using my version?
I run a mixture of Gnome and KDE applications. I use Konqueror as a web browser, Gimp for some graphic stuff, etc. The two toolkits are somewhat annoying because they do not interact particularly well.
When I write a GUI app, I want the interface code to be as separate from the logic as possible, to make swapping them in and out as easy as possible. Don't code an alternative, write a new interface for me!
Glade is a GTK+ interface builder. You use a drag-and-drop program to compose a UI, and it can generate the corresponding GTK+ code. You can save the project seperately as an XML application.
What is really exciting however is the companion libglade. This library reads in the XML that Glade writes at runtime and constructs the UI from that.
You therefore don't even need to necessarily use the UI builder to generate the XML if you don't want to. Perhaps you'll just translate a UI described in a different XML application.
So why do I think this is exciting?
Alter/tweak the UI at runtime, without a recompilation.
Translate (via XSL) an interface description in a different XML application. I haven't looked at the design of the XML glade dialect much myself, it might be a nightmare; but at least that nightmare could be hidden behind a translation.
Want a KDE version? Write a runtime, XML-interpreting UI builder for KDE!
Argh! so this rant has gone off-track a little bit. What else have I got to cover?</span></div></div>

MEISNER, one of the prosperous and highly-esteemed business men of Birnamwood, Shawano county, was born in Newton township, Manitowoc Co., Wis., February 14, 1860, and is a son of Frederick and Magarette (Steltzer) Meisner, both natives of Germany.
Frederick Meisner was born February 5, 1825, in Mechlenburg, Germany, and after the death of his father he, with his mother and the rest of the family, came to America in 1849, settling in Manitowoc county. Here the mother lived to the good old age, dying in 1888. The parental family comprised six children, namely John, Frederick, Joseph, Dora, Josephine and Mary. The mother of our subject was born in Bavaria about the year 1832. Her mother died in Germany, and about 1850 she came to America with her father and her three brothers; John, William and Nicholas—and three sisters—Mary, Cathrena and Lena. Her father was a farmer by occupation. Frederick Meisner had six children of whom Charles H., Frederick J. and Henry are living; William died when four years old; John when an infant, and a daughter, Bertha, when nine months old. This worthy couple at present reside on a farm purchased by Mr. Meisner some thirty-seven years ago, and which is situated near Manitowoc City. They are consistent members of the German Lutheran Church, and Frederick Meisner is a stanch Republican, although he has never taken a very active part in political matters.
Charles H. Meisner was reared to the life of a farmer's boy, obtaining his education in the common schools, and assisting his father upon the farm until he was of age. He then spent several summers working upon a farm. In June, 1884, in company with John Roepke, he came to Birnamwood, where he bought out a store owned by Hunter and Cole, and organized the firm of Roepke &amp; Meisner, proprietors of a general mercantile store. In 1889 they commenced the manufacture of lumber, buying and repairing a mill and furnishing employment to fifteen men, on an average. Both these gentlemen have built themselves handsome residences, and have dealt extensively in real estate, now owning some 1,300 acres of timber and farming lands. Charles H. Meisner was married January 4, 1884 to Miss Meta Pleuss, who was born in the same town and county as her husband. She is a daughter of Frederick and Mary (Levereriz) Pleuss, natives of Germany; who came to, America about 1850. The father; who was a farmer, died in 1877. They had a family of five daughters—Mary, Lizzie, Meta, Augusta and Minnie. Both the parents had children by former marriages. Mr. and Mrs. Meisner have no children.
In politics our subject is a good Republican, but has always been too busy attending to his own affairs to become an office-seeker. However, his fellow-citizens have shown their appreciation of his worth by making him town treasurer, and electing him to the minor offices. He was postmaster for eight years, and is one of the trustees of the village. He and his wife are members of the German Lutheran Church, and are held in high esteem.</span></div></div>

A new study from Tiina Pauno, a professor at the University of Helsinki, Finland found that many night workers actually have a variant in the genetic code that makes them less influenced by Melatonin and hence the circadian rhythm.
They tested 577 shift workers and looked for a genetic changes for job-related exhaustion. The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function. The result people who can do this have less receptors and are not sensitive to melatonin and tolerate nights much better. The people with this gene variant can sleep in bright light without any difficulty as well.
Hmm all those years you wondered why you couldn’t stay awake at a night job and your peers seemed to have no problems.
Sleep is very complex and poorly understood.</span></div></div>

According to David, data that used to take weeks, months or even years to acquire is now available to management in a matter of minutes, allowing for quick and informed decisions about critical business issues.
As Purple Wave began to refocus on specific segments, the continued insight gleaned from icimo and Tableau shifted to a more targeted and strategic marketing effort. For an online business, data is seemingly limitless— if it can be accessed. From historical buying tendencies and product performance, to geographic trends and other factors, Purple Wave is now able to market to customers and prospects with the confidence of having access to accurate and actionable data.</span></div></div>

Our stretch therapy (AIS technique) allows the body to repair itself and also to prepare for daily activity. The AIS technique involves the method of holding each stretch for only two seconds. This method of stretching is also known to work with the body’s natural physiological makeup to improve circulation and increase the elasticity of muscle joins and fascia. The AIS method of muscle lengthening and fascial release is a type of Athletic Stretching Technique that provides effective, dynamic, facilitated stretching of major muscle groups, but more importantly, AIS provides functional and physiological restoration of superficial and deep fascial planes.
AIS is important for injury prevention recovery, as well as performance enhancement.
AIS is something that everyone can benefit from. One of the many things that makes AIS superior in dealing with flexibility problems is that it has no age and very few contraindication limits. It can be used by the very young and by the most senior of senior citizens.

"Throwing balls toward a target is the oldest game known to mankind. As early as 5000 B.C. the Egyptians played a form of Bocce with polished rocks. Graphic representations of figures tossing a ball or polished stone have been recorded as early as 5200 B.C. While Bocce today looks quite different from its early predecessors, the unbroken thread of Bocce’s lineage is the consistently common objective of trying to come as close to a fixed target as possible.
From this early objective, the basic rules of Bocce were born. From Egypt, the game made its way to Greece around 800 B.C. The Romans learned the game from the Greeks, and then introduced it throughout the empire. The Roman influence in bocce is preserved in the game’s name; bocce derives from the Vulgate Latin bottia, meaning boss.
The early Romans were among the first to play a game resembling what we know as Bocce today. In early times they used coconuts brought back from Africa and later used hard olive wood to carve out Bocce balls. Beginning with Emperor Augustus, Bocce became the sport of statesman and rulers. From the early Greek physician Hippocrates to the great Italian Renaissance man Galileo, the early participants of Bocce have noted that the game’s athleticism and spirit of competition rejuvenates the body.
In 1576, the Republic of Venice publicly condemned the sport, punishing those who played with fines and imprisonment. And perhaps most grave was the condemnation by the Catholic Church which deterred the laity and officially prohibited clergyman from playing the game by proclaiming Bocce a means of gambling.
Bocce frequently lost and gained popularity throughout the ages. It was Giuseppe Garibaldi, who, while unifying and nationalizing Italy, popularized the sport as it is known today. In 1896, during a resurgence of popularity, the first Bocce Olympiad was held in Athens, Greece. Bocce has been a part of international sports ever since.
Thanks to many Italian immigrants at the turn of the century, Bocce has come to flourish in the United States. During its beginnings in the U.S., there were as many versions of the game as there were towns the immigrants had left. The popularity of Bocce in America has been on the rise since then and there are more than 25,000,000 Bocce enthusiasts throughout the United States today."
Next to Soccer and Golf, Bocce is the third most participated sport in the world and is considered the oldest know sport in world history.
Al Scaramella hosted the game that I attended. This day there were enough players to field two teams of four, one throwing red balls, the other green. Teams are determined as each player pulls a red or green ball out of a sack. Green always goes first.
The game starts with a member of the green team tossing out the Pallino, the small orange ball being thrown by Joe, above, who then rolls his green ball as close as he can to the Pallino. Red then tries to get closer to the Pallino than the green ball and each member of the red team rolls until a red ball ends up closest to the Pallino or all four reds are no closer than the green. Green gets to go again if a red ball ends up closer to the Pallino.
Above, the next ball to be thrown would be green since the red ball ended up closest to the Pallino. Capiche?
As in most sports, form is everything. Above Tony Alexander displays his form developed over years of playing bocce, starting "when I was only this high" said Tony with his hand waist high.
Host Al Scaramella was just as effective using the same form as Tony. Both showed the results of years playing bocce.
Strategy plays a big part in the game. Sometimes it's better to hit the ball of an opposing team than try to get close to the Pallino. The boards can also be used to position a ball behind the Pallino.
Above, Kevin tosses early in a game as Dennis, Tony, Aaron and Walter wait their turn. Tony and Al usually were anchors for their teams as it becomes important not to hit a ball of your same color and loose a point.
Sometimes a measurement has to be taken to determine which ball is closest. In the case above, one red ball is clearly closest but if the second red ball is closer to the Pallino than the green ball, then the red team gets two points instead of just one. Capiche?
Between games. Al Zambonis the court. Al built the court about four years ago and has been honing his skills ever since. Most remember when Bertuccis opened in 1984 or 85 with a Bocce court in the middle of the dining room. The court didn't last long for whatever reason.
First team to reach 11 and is ahead by at least two points wins. This day the green team won every game even though there were different players each time.
There is at least one other Bocce court in Holliston. Teams and tournaments could lead to a shot at the Summer Olympics. Perchè no?
I think this is fantastic. I played when I was a kid. Would love to be able to join a league in town.
Interesting article, thanks. Would be great to see a bocce court installed at Blair Square near the rail trail!
"The court didn't last long for whatever reason."
I think I should take some of the blame for the demise of the bocce court at Bertucci's. When it opened, my son was about 5. Bertucci's was a great place to take the kids (still is) and my son loved the bocce court, especially throwing the balls. His form wasn't as good as the pros, and occasionally, one of his throws went "out of bounds". I suspect there were other parents who failed at juggling waiting in line and making sure the balls stayed on the bocce court. Anyway, what goes around, comes around, and the offender is now 36, and expecting his first child in a few weeks.</span></div></div>

Recently, India’s greenest airport terminal at Chandigarh international airport in Mohali was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Built by Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;T), the terminal, spread over 53,000 square meters, is designed in accordance with concept of green building. The terminal sets a new benchmark in sustainability by incorporating various green technologies.
The terminal is constructed using over 55 lakh fly ash bricks and features cavity walls, double insulated roofing, energy efficient chillers, and a sensor-based plumbing system to save water. Such an extensive use of fly ash in construction of large structure is highly commendable.
The terminal has achieved a 4-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) rating.
Unlike other terminals, this does not have huge displays that run on artificial light and consume huge amount of electricity. Absence of displays has helped in cutting down maintenance costs and running expenditures.
The terminal does not require artificial lighting during day time owing to a transparent façade. Used glass on the façade is low-heat gain glass, which means it will automatically reduce the need for installing and spending on air conditioners.
A lawn laid out right inside the terminal delivers a refreshing treat for passengers.
The available air conditioners are equipped with sensors that can detect body heat for automatic activation. Rest of the time, the ACs remain in sleep mode to save energy.
To meet the electricity requirements, a 200 KW solar plant is installed on the rooftop of the terminal. Solar plant generates enough energy to meet the major power needs of the building.
For lighting during nights, 40 percent of the airport is illuminated with energy-efficient LEDs.
The terminal also includes a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 600 KLD. The treatment plant is based on environment-friendly extended aeration technology. The recycled water is reused for flushing and gardening.
The airport terminal is one of its kind in India, may be in world too. It hasn’t received any name yet, but most likely it is to be named after Indian revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh. The new airport will facilitate neighboring states including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.</span></div></div>

The city of Split, and majestic mountains, far off in the distance.
Looking up from Trogir’s network of little streets.
Cheery lemons await picking, or just admirers.
A tiny church, off in the distance.
Silhouette of Kairos (the god of the fleeting moment), modeled after a 3rd-century bas-relief found in the town.
These are beautiful. Lucky you!
Lucky indeed, Caitlin. When we walk out among the buildings adorned with coats of arms, strolling the city’s labyrinthine lanes, I have to pinch myself that I’ve been in such a special city for over a month. The friendly people here make Trogir all the more wonderful.
Jen, I agree with you that perpetually sunny skies can get a bit overwhelming. I felt the same way this past fall, visiting sunny Nevada. Sometimes I just yearned for a rain cloud or two. I suppose the “grass is always greener.” I liked your line that once again the “blue skies hold magic” for you.
Some great looking up shots, Tricia. Love the one between the houses, with the lamp in, and that cat shot is wonderful.
Thanks, Jo! We do a lot of looking up here because a lot of the fun details are hidden up there.
Tricia I so loved your blue skies today. It has been the usual 300 days of rain followed by a day of sunshine. This is the rain-forest area so we must accept the rain but right now I do believe I have webbed feet. V.
Soon you’ll be admiring all the emerald beauty around you!
Those date palms set against blue skies is something to be cheery about. What a beautiful place to choose for home away from home. How long is this stay?
Lynne, I didn’t know that those were date palms! Thanks for providing that botanical tidbit.
We’ll be returning to Germany/France in May or June. (We can only stay in the Schengen Zone for 90 days at a time.) Since tourist season will be picking up here in the coming weeks and months, we’ll probably flit on off to another home away from home. There are so many lovely options – Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania? Another spot in Croatia? We’ll see. I am sad at the thought of leaving Trogir, though, as we’ve met some really kind people and are starting to feel a bit like locals.
Tricia Mitchell is spending some time in Trogir and exploring Dalmatia and she has written some very interesting posts, which are recommended reading!
The blue skies are a striking background for all your beautiful photos. Everything looks good against a clear blue sky! My favorites are the flags.
Hi Marilyn, blue is such a regal color – fitting for Trogir’s magnificent architecture! I also find the Croatian flag to be quite striking, especially contrasted with that column and centuries-old buildings.
Mark, I have to pinch myself whenever I see so much vibrant life here, even during these late winter months.
I am pleased to find you via “Our Adventure in Croatia”. Stunning pics!
Tina, the feeling is mutual. Thanks for your flattering feedback and for visiting! In what part of Serbia do you live?
I live in the South East. Near Nis. We are kinda distant neighbors.
Indeed :) – we might be heading that way – we shall see. So much to explore in this region! How long have you lived there?
This time it is a long term stay. (maybe permanent.). We only just arrived in Nov (2012). But we were here two previous times for 5 months each tip. I am getting my bearings. :) Very Challenging with a toddler!
Wow, I can imagine how it must be challenging navigating new customs with a little one! Are you speaking multiple languages to your child?
Yes, but she cannot speak yet. In time she will be bi-lingual.
Ah, beautiful Tricia, croation skies are different than californian skies ,I can see. Enjoy!
I’ll have to read up on why the color varies so, Cornelia. The winter light is of course quite different here on the seaside than in Germany.
The winter side is usually more bluish,, and the place where you are is usually more yellowish and reddish, talking in photography terms. It all depends on the temperature and the reflection of the sky, just a simple explanation so far.
I wonder why that part of the world has such intense blue skies! The puzzled cat and the soaring seagull are my favourite picks Tricia.
I thought that too, Madhu. I’ll have to ask my meteorologist friend.</span></div></div>

Visual artists are visual thinkers! So we made anatomy books for artists. They don't want to read magnificent, but boring anatomy textbooks, stuffed with medical level information.
Instead, the author made a book with clear images, that contain only the necessary information needed, to create a realistic human form.
Most pictures in the book are self-explanatory. The text part of this book is only about 2%.
The concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.
The book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.
"A secret weapon" to making a realistic human form.
What sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore. Be inspired, and don’t waste your precious time on the search for images in google, basically, everything you need is in this book!</span></div></div>

This will be the 3rd time one of my children gets to experience this. It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that.
Unfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over.
Oh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run.
Poor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like. I hope it goes well and solves all the problems!
Good luck girl! Let me know how things turn out. Wish I could be up there.
So nice to hear your Grandchild is having surgery on a blog spot!!
Dad told me or I still wouldn't know. So much for concerned parents/grandparents.
Amber you poor thing could anything else happen...Knock on wood. Hey when you get a chance check my blog cause I pictured Tagged you. The rules are on the post. Good luck with all thats going on.
Amber - I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Knock on wood, but I haven't had to see my kids go under anesthesia yet. Hang in there. I hope the tubes really help Talmadge!</span></div></div>

How long have you been preserving flowers with freeze drying? When and where did the floriculture life begin for you?
I started in 1988 in California… another business with my Mom &amp; Sister. We were buying our flowers from local growers in Watsonville &amp; also importing from South America. We wanted to find a piece of land and begin growing our own flowers so we would have 100% control over the quality of our products. That began our search which lasted for several years until we found our beautiful land.
What (or who) inspired you to raise flowers and learn to preserve the petals?
My grandparents always had an incredible garden. I remember when I was a very young girl just how special it was to go through the white arch of the picket fence into the back gardens and what a special occasion it always was to have access to their gardens and to be there with them… gardening, harvesting flowers &amp; the sweetest raspberries. My parents both loved gardening as well. The raising of flowers and the preservation of the petals came much later once we found our slice of paradise with our land here in Rainbow Valley, Oregon. Our property sits on the mighty South Umpqua River which is how we responsibly irrigate all of our flower fields using a drip irrigation system. This way, each crop receives the correct amount of water and none is wasted.
Do you grow flowers other than roses?
We grow roses, hydrangea, peonies, lilacs… all of them are lovingly harvested by hand and carefully loaded into our specialized freeze-dry machines used to preserve the flowers and petals. Everything is done right here on our property… the growing, harvesting, processing and shipping. All done with positive energy and wonderful intentions.
What do you enjoy most about the craft of drying rose petals for weddings and special events?
Hands down it is the joy of growing the flowers. We are so lucky to see this stunning beauty we create with Mother Nature’s help. We love all of the bees, the butterflies, lady bugs and the sweet floral scent that surrounds us on our land. Maybe even more importantly is how happy our flowers make all of our customers. We are so grateful for all the love they give back to us with glowing reviews, photos and more … they are incredible!
What are some of the ways folks can incorporate your flower petals into their celebrations?
The uses for our petals are really unlimited. First thing that comes to mind is for a romantic celebration. Valentine’s day is a big one! They are used for proposals, engagement parties, save the date cards, weddings for creating or decorating the aisle, the guests to shower the blissful newlyweds with a petal toss when walking back down the aisle or for their first dance. To decorate the reception tables &amp; couples honeymoon suite, include in thank you notes, gender reveals, babies first photos. They’re also used by resorts and hotels for rose petal turndown and spa services. We have many people that use them to honor and celebrate loved ones for memorials, funerals, celebration of life events. We have had people toss from helicopters, small planes, hot air balloons, military flyovers. Several natural soap, cosmetics and bath bomb companies incorporate our petals into their products. Party &amp; home decorations, the Rose Parade every January. There are unlimited ways to include rose petals into your life… let your imagination have fun creating new ways to use them.
Where can your flower petals be purchased at this time?
Freeze dried rose petals can be used in culinary projects. Have you ever done this?
We have made a number of items with our petals and so have many of our customers. The one that stands out the most is a company that uses our lilac petals in a special microbrew beer they blend. Now that’s creative!
What resources do you find invaluable to the novice flower farmer? Do you have any tips for folks who might want to try freeze-drying their own rose petals from their gardens?
Freeze drying utilizes highly specialized equipment which is very, very expensive. It is something you are able to do at home if you are willing to invest thousands of dollars for the small table top models. There are other methods of drying flowers, however, they will look like dried flowers verses fresh like freeze-dried petals and flowers look. Follow your heart, do what you are most passionate about. Experiment with plants, annuals, perennials, fruits &amp; veggies… you just never know what will inspire and delight you until you try it!
We loved hearing more about your wonderful flower farm and, putting together this post, can almost smell the gorgeous flowers! Your farm is bringing joy to so many celebrations and that is something to celebrate, too.
You can keep up with Flyboy Naturals on their Facebook page at Flyboy Naturals Rose Petals and on on Instagram @flyboynaturalsrosepetals. And you can find FarmGirlRosePetals on Facebook, too.
Do you have unique ideas for incorporating flower petals into celebrations? Share in the comments, we’d love to hear them!
Rose petals can add that special touch to just about any occasion, but when the celebration is over, you might be looking to sweep up those sweet blossoms. Solution? If you haven’t already purchased a farm-crafted, sustainably sourced broom from Little John… what are you waiting for? Sweeping up rosy rose petals is just one small task these mighty brooms are good at. And, since they last forever, there will be many more occasions where sweeping with a “piece of art” will bring you much joy!</span></div></div>

OBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a significant health problem that is linked to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.
METHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.
RESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.
CONCLUSION: TQ exhibits a regenerative potential for the treatment of damaged peripheral nerves.</span></div></div>

Also inspect the lift wire/guide to see if it is bent, corroded or catching on something, preventing the flapper from closing properly.
The float arm needs to be adjusted so that the water level is 2" below the top of the overflow pipe. The float arm may need to be repositioned to obtain the desired water level. If it is a plastic float arm, adjust the screw located at the top of the arm. Also make sure the refill tube is located about 1/4" over the overflow pipe. If necessary, clip the tube to the overflow pipe to stabilize it and keep it from moving into the overflow pipe.
Consider replacing or repairing the service line to prevent larger loss of water. A professional service may need to be contacted for completing this task.
At this point, try to determine where the water is going inside the home.
Finally, if all of the above tests show no evidence of leaked water, check the appliances that cycle. Water softeners can cause an increase in usage, so check the settings to make sure it is not cycling more often than necessary and monitor its full cycle to make sure it is operating properly. Also check outside spigots and hydrants to make sure they are not dripping, especially when connected to a sprinkler, soaker hose, or irrigation system. Take note of the times when extra water may be used, possibly weekends and evenings, when watering plants and gardens.

What's this all About?
You could say I grew up traveling, when I was young I lived in Lagos, Nigeria with my family. Over the years I spent there we traveled to some of the countries you see highlighted in green. During these travels I saw the pyramids of Egypt, I summited Mt. Kilimanjaro, skied in the alps, learned how to scuba dive in Mauritius, and so much more. I was very lucky in this respect, but living in West Africa exposed me to some stark realities. I quickly came to understand that the world is a harsh place to most people. The struggle for survival is something real and a part of most peoples' everyday lives.
It wasn't until later, that I decided to travel again. This time on my own. At the age of twenty, fed up with the mundane routine of my life, I decided to take some time off school and head south. From my home in Colorado I traveled to Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. I was interested in environmental science, ecology, and societies different from my own and this area of the world beaconed me.
I fell in love with the culture, the people, fellow travelers and the Spanish language. I spent just a few months down there, but I left with a promise to return. After just a couple years I graduated with a degree from Colorado State University, and I fulfilled that promise. It's now been over three years of traveling and I am still living the transient life, as a writer, traveler, and outdoor guide.
Where will I be going next?
The concept of Tramp-N-Trekker is simple, its a blog about the intersect between outdoor enthusiasm and a loose footing lifestyle. Covering a wide range of topics like the cost of living abroad, backpacking meals, gear reviews, travel tips, musings from the vagabond lifestyle and my personal thoughts on all related matters. This is meant to be for anyone who wants to travel, regardless of location or duration. It is meant to inspire people to travel while offering the tips and tricks I've acquired from doing so myself. During my travels I will be backpacking into the mountains, forests and jungles of the world. Exploring iconic cities and small villages alike. Meeting new people, and doing whatever else comes my way.</span></div></div>

Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for end-stage liver disease, which kills 11,000 people a year in England. Deaths from liver disease have soared by 25 per cent in a decade and continue to rise, while the average age of death from liver disease (currently 50-59 years) continues to decrease.
Today NICE has issued final guidance which recommends the procedure — ex-vivo machine perfusion for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation — is used under special arrangements as more data is gathered into its efficacy.
NICE’s independent advisory committee did not identify any major safety concerns.
NHS England and commissioners will decide whether they fund the procedure. However research is already taking place at centres around the UK including studies by experts from the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research in the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre.
University of Birmingham Honorary Professor Darius Mirza, Consultant Transplant Surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said: “In the 30 years I’ve been involved with transplantation there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I’m absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practice organ storage and transplantation.
Sue Bennett, 45, a mother of three from Ranton in Staffordshire, had a liver transplant using this new technique in 2015.
She said: “I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn’t sleep and my quality of life was quite low.
“Having a transplant has changed my life. I‘ve joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team.
John Forsythe, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “There has been a huge amount of research in the area of preservation and perfusion methods that allow us to both assess precious donor organs and to enhance their function. This could potentially mean the organ works better and improve transplant outcomes.
“Many of the lead researchers in the area of transplant preservation and perfusion techniques are in UK and it is good to see UK researchers continue to be at the forefront in this field.
Vanessa Hebditch, director of policy at the British Liver Trust said, “Every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease die whilst waiting for a transplant.
“This new device offers real hope as it may improve transplant outcomes and allow livers that were previously thought to be unsuitable to be used and also increase the time that livers are able to be kept.
For the financial year ending 31 March 2018, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list, according to NHS Blood and Transplant.
The number of patients on the active transplant list reached a ten year high in 2015 when 611 patients were on the waiting list. However the large drop attributed to the 2018 figure may be due to the introduction of the National Liver Offering Scheme (NLOS) in March 2018.</span></div></div>

We established over 6400 centres in 30 districts under three defined zones; Agra, Bareilly and Faizabad in the first phase of the project.
After the successful execution of the first phase, the Government of UP awarded Vayam with 20 districts in the second phase.

Children's book illustrator Jody Wheeler has worked on a variety of books, from nonfiction titles for middle readers to fiction titles for young readers. Focusing on extreme conditions, Wheeler has illustrated more than a half a dozen weather-related titles written by Lorraine Jean Hopping. Included in the series are Wild Weather: Blizzards, which combines historical incidents involving blizzards with facts about these massive storms and descriptions of the job of a meteorologist. Wild Weather: Lightning! includes facts about the study of lightning and its potential deadly consequences, with many maps and illustrations. Booklist's Ilene Cooper called the watercolor artwork in Wild Weather: Blizzards "effective."
Wheeler has also teamed up with author Rosemary Wells to produce a series of books for preschoolers, with Wheeler providing the interior artwork. In Read Me a Story, little kitten Yoko knows how to read but does not tell her mother for fear that she will stop reading to her. Yoko's ability comes from a decoder ring she sent for. Finding out about Yoko's talent, the mother assures the kitten that she will keep reading to her, and, in fact, allows Yoko to read to her. School Library Journal critic Anne Knickerbocker said of Wheeler's artwork, "Each page sports a bright, color illustration that will aid beginning readers in decoding the text."
Wheeler once told SATA: "I developed a greater than average interest in children's books at an early age, having been influenced and encouraged by my great-aunt Opal Wheeler, a prolific writer of books for young readers in the 1950s. After being trained as a fine artist and art educator, I moved to Manhattan in 1977, and eventually turned to the field of publishing. I worked as a design assistant/secretary at Dial Press in the juvenile books division for two years before establishing my own freelance illustration business in 1980. Since then, I have enjoyed working on a variety of projects ranging from picture books to educational texts and magazines, greeting cards to coloring books."

IBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor.
IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.
The new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips.
Clusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.
IBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.
"For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two," Turek said. "Its an attractive proposition."
AMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.
With the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.
On Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.
/zimages/3/28571.gifRead "MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade."
Gordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.
"Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC," said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. "Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for."
While backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.
Turek agreed. "The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry," he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.
"Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand," he said.
The Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.
Also included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.
In the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science &amp; Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry.</span></div></div>

The Yacht Club is on the wind protected left side of the big bay, the rest of the shoreline looks like Miami, or Ft. Lauderdale, or Puerto Vallarta. Our first impression was to get what we needed and get out. It was crowded boats on the hook, mooring balls, and a lot of crap tied around the area. We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala. The snooty factor in Acapulco is about a 9 on the 10 point snooty scale.
Didn’t even drag a camera out.
Acapulco helds no interest for us…so goodbye Acapulco.</span></div></div>

Most people think of marketing as a strictly private sector activity, but the reality is people with sales and marketing backgrounds are hired by government agencies in a number of capacities. Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.
Almost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.
Government agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.
Most government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.
Local, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.

I can not start any programs because of the error "Access denied" (see photo). What can I do?
To fix this it needs to implement a few permissions to wine and it should be installed to external storage. Temporary - until the next wine will be published - it can be done using some apk-editor/modification-utility through adding those permissions manually to the manifest. Also create some new folder on /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/. Call this folder "org.winehq.wine" and add in there another folder like "drive_z".
Use a sophisticated file-manager to connect the wine-app with the "org.winehq.wine"-folder and create the connection to drive_z, i.e. "Z:\" through wineconfig.

Good Morning. I have the same problem. It says "Access Denied" every time I want to execute an .exe file. I am a root user and I have tried to modify the permissions with applications like "total commander" but I did not succeed.
I thank you for helping us. Excuse my English, I'm from Argentina, I speak Spanish. Can you be a little clearer? I do not understand why I do not handle my English very well. Thank you!
Hello, I am new to this forum. I've been able to modify the app manifest to install on the sd card, grant read/write permission, and mount/unmount file systems. I couldn't quite find the other permissions that were suggested. Also, do you mind elaborating on how to do this? Or which app could be used to do so?
Thanks! But it finally makes sense now. "Access denied" must come up whenever trying to run a program that isn't compiled for ARM.

That's good because we were almost out of card puns for this one. Regardless of the terrible puns, we stand by what we said about fitting in but also being an individual and all that jazz. Which is exactly why we think a playing card its the perfect representational costume of the dichotomy of individualism vs. collectivist natures... and also we really like cards. Throwing them at things, building card castles with them, and playing games with them. Perhaps you have a kid like this. What? No, not a kid posing rhetorical questions about individualism, a kid who likes cards.
If you do have a kid like this, well then we have the perfect outfit for them. Our Kids Ace of Clubs Costume has a white, foam-backed sleeveless tunic designed to look like the ace of clubs. Attached is a black velvet hood and cowl collar, shaped to look like a club, with a zipper up the back. The neck of the hood has elastic around the front edge for a snug fit around the face, and it comes with black velvet mitts with wide cuffs and elastic at the wrists. Your kid will look fancy enough to be invited to royal croquet parties in the garden.
Ooh! You could say your kid will be "on deck" in this outfit!... Wait, we can do better than that. This fun outfit will have your kid ready to shuffle!... Alright, we're done now. Promise.</span></div></div>

I’ve been nominated me for a Liebster blogging award. This is an award that’s given to new bloggers as a way to recognize &amp; encourage them in their work.
Ayanna over at 21 Flavors of Splendor has nominated me for this award, and I couldn’t be more grateful. I’ve been following Ayanna, pretty much since I started blogging. She’s always been encouraging and this nomination is just further proof of that. Head over to check out her blog, oh and her Instagram is one full of encouragement and fun peaks into her everyday!
Another blog that I really love is Rachael’s over at Oh Lord Help Us. This is a woman sharing her faith and sharing her resources. It’s clear from the moment you enter the world of her blog, she’s looking to be real, have real conversation, and share her real learning. In addition to her blog, she’s also making some pretty sweet jewelry pieces. And as if that weren’t enough, she’s donating the proceeds from sales to invest back in her ministry to share Gods truth with woman of faith to know who they were created to be. This is a ministry and blog that will encourage women to live to their full potential as strong and fierce daughters of God. Check her out over at her blog, Instagram or any of her social media accounts. She’s always dishing out some encouragement.
The rules of this nomination encourage each blogger to share some randomness about ourselves. This is such a fun way to get to know each other a little better. So here we go!
I often make myself giggle. I’m the funniest person I know. Kidding..a little!
I’ve watched “The Office” and embarrassing number of times, I could probably quote the entire series.
My family and I speak fluent movie quotes…it keeps things interesting!
I typically eat all the snacks after my kids are asleep, then claim to have no idea what happened to them. NO SELF CONTROL!
Some more encouraged fun is answering questions from the person who nominated you, and posing 10 of your own for your nominations to answer on their website. Ayanna asked some really good ones, check them out below.
I started blogging as a creative outlet. At first, I was into the thrill of learning the in’s and out’s of the process. Then I realized, I had a voice, actual things to say that could help others. This is why I continue to blog.
The name of my website perfectly describes the main themes of my life. We’re a family totally dependent of God’s grace to make it through the struggles of everyday life. Giggling is how we keep sane!
Italy, definitely Italy! Or maybe Main, I hear they have the most amazing Autumn seasons.
What is your favorite fiction book?
Is it bad that I don’t have one? I’m not much of a reader. Lately my reading is mostly of other’s blogs. I’ve been learning so much from my blogging buddies, and have gained new perspectives.
New friends! Admittedly, I’m not a social media person at all. In fact before my blog, I had almost no presence on any of it. Since I started blogging, I’ve made many friends all around the globe and have joined in prayer, joys, and sorrows with them.
If you could meet any person, who is still alive, who would it be and why?
I had to really think about this one, but here’s who I came up with…ANY MISSIONARY. I know that God has me tethered to my current place, so I often look in amazement at folks who are picking up and moving out all in an effort to further the Kingdom of heaven and help as many people as possible. It’s a pretty interesting calling and life to lead.
Coffee &amp; my Bible. I know that’s two things, but it measures up to one good morning.
If you could eat one food every day and not worry about the calories, what would it be?
Ice cream, with tons of stuff in it. I love stuff, any stuff, in my ice cream!
What do you see happening on your blog in year 5?
I’ve started praying for God to use my website as a way to lift others, and to connect a body of of like minded people to encourage each other and share life stories. I’m letting God lead me at this point, I’m willing to turn in any direction He leads me to.
What’s your favorite activity (outside of blogging, of course!)?
What’s the one T.V. show that you hope(d) never goes (went) off the air?
If you were to start a charity, who would it benefit?
Are you a morning person? If so, please help me with some tips!
What’s one piece of advice you can give to new bloggers?
What’s you favorite social media platform?
What are some goals you have for your website?
Ladies, I’m so excited to read all the answers to these questions! Have fun with your answers.
Thank you again to Ayanna, who gave me this opportunity to not only share more about myself, but to keep this recognition train rolling.
Thank the person who nominated you, and post a link to their blog on your blog.
Display the award on your blog — by including it in your post, or by having it as the feature image.
Write a 150-300 word post about your favorite blog that is not your own. Explain why you like the blog, provide links.
Provide 10 random facts about yourself.
Answer the questions from your nominator.
Nominate 5 – 11 blogs that you feel deserve the award, who have less than 200 followers.
Ask your nominees questions of your own.
Jesus really is the reason-Sorry Santa!
Welcome to this space on the world wide web I’ve carved out for faith, family, food &amp; funnies. Here I’m sharing all the things that bring me joy.
I didn’t always know God, but this much I do know, He’s always been with me. I’m so sure that God intended for us to share with each other for the sake of community &amp; encouragement. So for that reason, I’m laying out for you all that I’m learning.
Oh, and I have the privilege of bringing you the testimonies of some serious God loving women!
Feel free to jump in, leave comments &amp; share along with us.

This fusion makes the spine less flexible and can lead to a curved posture forward. When the ribs are touched, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease.
Its actual causing reason is still unknown. But it is hypothesized that some genes like HLA-B27 may be responsible for developing this disease.</span></div></div>

From December 1 to December 12, citizens can donate items in their own neighborhoods or at local participating businesses to help neighbors in need.
The Food Elves is a charitable community service group made up of more than 60 students ranging from elementary through high school. For the past two years they have joined forces with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to operate the “12 Days of Donating” campaign with great success. This year the Elves aim to beat last year’s record-breaking collection drive by raising more than $5,700 and 4,200 pounds of goods.
According to the Food Pantry, about 600 households are registered to use Pantry services. This year’s need will be even greater due to a decrease in SNAP benefits in November. Health and hygiene items are not covered by those benefits and are a particular need.
In early December, Food Elves will notify their neighbors about the collection campaign, including what items can be collected and the collection dates. Residents simply place bags of goods at their mailboxes on the designated pickup day and the Elves will do the rest. Collection dates will be Saturday, December 7, Sunday, December 8, or Saturday, December 14.
In case there’s no Elf in your neighborhood, it is still easy to donate. The Elves have placed bright red collection bins at participating Downtown Partnership member businesses. If the Elves meet their goal of collecting more than 1,200 pounds of goods, each business has pledged to donate $200. There will be a donation bin at the Holiday Stroll tree lighting ceremony at Dean College on Thursday, December 5, or you can drop off donations at the Food Pantry, 43 West Central St., and designate them for the “12 Days of Donating” drive.

Follow the consulate on Facebook.
As with each edition, this month’s included a spotlight on Belgian living and working in the consulate’s jurisdiction. Known as “The Belgian in the Picture,” the series aims to show just how deeply impactful the country’s economic and cultural engagement with the South is, despite its small size. The below Q&amp;A is reprinted with permission and has been lightly edited for clarity and style.
Belgian Consulate: Paul De Sloover, a veteran Belgian entrepreneur in the U.S., is being spotlighted in this month’s newsletter — appropriated given that his latest venture provides an innovative way to generate power from the sun. Mr. De Sloover, can you tell us more about the solar roof tiles made by Desol Power Tiles?
Mr. de Sloover: Solar roof tiles are roof tiles with integrated solar panels. Instead of installing unsightly solar panels on top of an existing roof, with DeSol Power Tiles it is your roof itself that captures the sunlight. The tiles themselves look like regular classic Nordic style roof tiles, and when installed as instructed they form a completely sealed, walkable and hurricane-resistant roof.
Belgian Consulate: What are other reasons more people are choosing solar roof tiles rather than solar panels?
Mr. de Sloover: An issue a lot of people run into when they consider turning to solar energy, is that most home owners’ associations don’t accept the looks of large solar panels. Because our solar roof tiles don’t affect the aesthetic or architectural appeal of the roof, it removes that hurdle entirely.
Belgian Consulate: With 31 years of experience as an entrepreneur in the U.S., what is your favorite aspect of doing business here?
Mr. de Sloover: I would have to say the easy access to people and institutions, and the willingness of people to inform and help you in what you want to realize. And, of course, the advantages of the sheer size of the market and having unified regulations in that one big market. That is a definite advantage compared to Europe where every country has different regulations regarding solar roof tiles.
Belgian Consulate: What would you tell a budding Belgian entrepreneur dreaming of taking his chances in the U.S.?
Mr. de Sloover: Don’t dream, act. America, the United States, is a very open country. Spend time going to business fairs and talking to professional people. Do not assume that what works in Belgium will work in the States. Do your research.
Belgian Consulate: How do you see the future of eco-friendly energy in the US?
Mr. de Sloover: At this point there are two different schools of thought. Part of the people want to keep everything the way it is, and the other group of people wants renewable energy. Recent polls show that 73 percent of the American population believes in renewable energy. It will take time to get there, because this country, the United States, has an abundance of fossil fuels in its soil. But it also has an abundance of sunshine. So I would say, the future is bright.</span></div></div>

Unlike many other sports games (and like Squaresoft games) instead of playing in "live action" you have to choose commands for each movement you will do. Each team has 6 players.
Each one of your teammates (which are NOT the main party members of FFX) has his own statistics, and depending on them and in your strategy, you will be able to win tournaments and/or leagues of the game. By doing this you'll receive rare items depending in which place you ended.
HP - Hit Points. You use hit points for everything. From defending to shooting, the HP are like the stamina of your player.
CAT - Catching. Only used by goalkeepers. It is used to stop shoots. The more Cathing, the more shots your goalkeeper will stop.</span></div></div>

Growing specialization and diversification have brought a host of monographs and textbooks on increasingly specialized topics. However, the "tree" of knowledge of mathematics and related fields does not grow only by putting forth new branches. It also happens, quite often in fact, that branches which were thought to be completely disparate are suddenly seen to be related. Further, the kind and level of sophistication of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years: measure theory is used (non- trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And in addition to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as "experimental mathematics", "CFD", "completely integrable systems", "chaos, synergetics and large-scale order", which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes. They draw upon widely different sections of mathematics.

I had just bought the two Models Own nail polish featured above – Boots are currently having a 2 for £8 offer on them, so now is the time to snap some up. I’m looking forward to trying the Hed Kandi collaboration – a have seen it on a few friends nails and it looks fabulous.
I always need some hand cream with me because I hate how dry my hand gets from using cheap soap at work – this works a treat. The superbalm from Liz Earle is really good for lips and any dry patches you might have – it works wonders on elbows! I am loving the new Revlon Lip Butters – I often find lipsticks really drying so this is a perfect solution.
My sheep keyring was from the Mark Fast goodie bag I managed to grab while I was at fashion week – I like this little dude on my keys, don’t you? I just picked up this case for my phone and I love it – it made me feel like I had a whole new phone again.
I always throw this beanie in my bag to keep my hair dry and under control in this ridiculous weather we have been having in the UK. Lastly is my purse from Zara which my mum got me at Christmas – skulls and spiky studs, pretty much me in purse form.</span></div></div>

Perth’s lost 75 per cent of its bushland and about a third of what’s left is at risk.
The Greens say this increases the intensity of heatwaves, which kill more Australians than any other natural disaster.
Climate change modelling suggests there’ll be twice as many heatwaves in Australia by 2050.

That being said, pro-sumer Digital SLR cameras as well as full Professional SLR cameras use CompactFlash as it seems to be more reliable and is certainly faster when it comes to continuous write speeds. Today we are taking a look at a very expensive 16GB card from SanDisk that is from their flagship line – the Extreme Pro. These cards claim to have a write speed of up to 90MB/sec – making them some of the fastest flash cards to ever hit the general public. How much will this set you back? SanDisk lists the MSRP at a mere $335.99USD currently. Before you choke and run away, let’s take a look and see if this price tag is justified in any way, shape or form.
Founded in 1988 by Dr. Eli Harari, an internationally recognized authority on non-volatile memory technology, SanDisk has grown to become the world’s largest supplier of innovative flash memory data storage products.
SanDisk currently has more than 1,100 U.S. patents, more than 600 foreign patents, and more than 1440 patent applications pending in the U.S. SanDisk is the only company, worldwide, that has the rights to both manufacture and sell every major flash card format, including CompactFlash®, SD™, miniSD™, microSD™, MultiMediaCard™, Reduced Size MultiMediaCard (RS-MMC™), Memory Stick PRO™ and related Memory Stick® products, xD-Picture Card™ and USB flash drives.
SanDisk became a publicly traded company (NASDAQ:SNDK) in November 1995, and in 2008 revenues were 3.3 billion. With more than 3,400 employees worldwide, SanDisk is headquartered in Milpitas, California.
My interest in a fast CompactFlash card was recently piqued when I picked up a Nikon D300s DSLR. This card uses both SD and CF media and you can specify which picture format gets stored on each card. Normally I take pictures and save them lossless as RAW (NEF) as well as JPG. I love the convenience of the Eye-Fi SD card for uploading my pictures to Flickr and to my computer and it is nice to have all the RAW files stored on a separate card. The problem is that each RAW image is over 9MB and the camera takes up to 8FPS with a battery grip. It doesn’t take long to fill the buffer and start slowing the camera down.
The Extreme Pro series of CompactFlash cards come in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB capacities and can cost you almost $900 for the 64GB version. These cards are not for the weak of heart, but they do offer a nice bunch of features.
The following information has been pulled from the SanDisk product page and posted here for your convenience.
Now there’s a memory card fast enough to keep up with your advanced DSLR: The SanDisk Extreme® Pro™ CompactFlash® card. With lightning-fast (up to 90 MB/s* read/write) speed, you’ll be able to capture more continuous burst shooting-and get the most out of your professional digital SLR camera. And with up to 64GB** of storage, you’ll be ready for more RAW+JPEG and high-def video.
SanDisk engineered its Power Core™ Controller to take whatever your camera’s buffer can dish out. By distributing image data across the card more rapidly and efficiently, this card delivers professional performance.
POWER CORE CONTROLLERTM &amp; ENHANCED SUPER-PARALLEL PROCESSINGTM “ESP”: Was invented by SanDisk to increase the card’s performance level.
On the next page we’ll take a look at this cards performance in our camera and on our computer.
For this review we used the speedy Addonics ADSACF-N SATA CompactFlash card reader . This device supports UDMA enabled CompactFlash cards and is about the fastest CompactFlash card reader we could get our hands on with short notice. Some Firewire 800 card readers are available as well and they should certainly push the limits of this card. As previously mentioned, we also used a Nikon D300s DSLR camera that shoots in continuous mode at 7FPS with the built-in battery and up to 8FPS with the additional MB-D10 battery pack. For this review we used the MB-D10 battery grip in order to push the limits of this card.
For comparison in both HDTach as well as the actual camera tests, we compared the SanDisk Extreme Pro 600x card with an affordable Lexar 8GB 80x card. Obviously the difference should be obvious, but it is interesting to see how much difference there is in the real world.
While the Extreme Pro supports UDMA 6 (Ultra ATA/133), the Addonics Card Reader only supports UDMA 5 (Ultra ATA/100). This is still faster than any built-in USB card reader on your laptop or desktop computer and HDTach should show some interesting performance.
We start things off with a look at HDTach and compare the Lexar 8GB 80x card against the SanDisk 16GB 600x card. As you can see read performance is taken care of by the SanDisk card. It doesn’t come close to its 90MB/sec speed, but it does burst to over 67MB/sec and averages 34.6MB/sec read speed. Compare this to the Lexar card which bursts to 15.9MB/sec and averages a 15.6MB/sec read speed.
With those numbers in mind, we popped these cards into the D300s and started clicking. We shot images in bright daylight at 1/200 shutter speed at ISO100, with no noise reduction. The Tokina 11-16mm lens was set at f2.8 and we ran through a couple of tests. The first test was to see how fast the camera could fill the buffer and once it was full, we’d take two more frames to get our first result. In RAW mode, the images at 4288×2848 and were averaging about 9.28MB in size. The SanDisk card shot 20 images in exactly 3 seconds. The buffer filled at about 18 images and we snapped a couple more for a realistic result. The Lexar card started out pretty good, but when the buffer filled, it slowed down to a crawl as it couldn’t write data very fast. We took 19 images in 5 seconds with this card.
Once we did the initial speed test, we timed out how long it took to take 30 images. Once again we started out with the SanDisk Extreme Pro and we took 30 images in 5 seconds flat. That works out to six images per second – including the time it take to write to the card once the buffer is full. The Lexar card took 19 seconds to snap the same 30 image set. The first 17 were very fast, but the next images were painfully slow.
The above information doesn’t really indicate actual write speed as the camera buffer is holding 17 images and writing as fast as possible. The reality is that you can continue to shoot 5 images per second while the SanDisk card is writing data and the Lexar card takes over a second to write a single image. The Lexar card is more than 6x slower in the real world.
While I’m sure that most people wouldn’t consider spending $250+ on a 16GB CompactFlash Card, if you’re a budding photographer and you just have to capture that action shot to get your big break, the SanDisk Extreme Pro card won’t leave you waiting. It writes incredibly fast, reads data from the card in a snap and worked flawlessly through the weeks that we pounded this card in our tests. We used it in low temperatures -10C without issues and I’m confident that this card will keep on kicking long after your SD cards have corrupted. In the D300s, I used it to record my RAW images and sent the JPEGs to an SD card and this convenience and performance is fantastic.
The bottom line is this: “Would I spend $250 on this card?” I wish I had $250 to spend on it as it gives you the freedom to shoot as much as you need to without worrying about slowing down your camera considerably while the card writes images from the buffer. The performance you gain from this card is remarkable – if you have a fast camera – but you’ll have to decide if the performance is worth the price. This makes it hard to score value – as it is extremely expensive for 16GB of storage, but for the speed it is priced not too badly.
If you’re even considering this card, you probably have over $2000 worth of camera kit hanging around your neck and this would only represent about 10% of your investment. If you look at it that way, it’s probably not a bad buy.</span></div></div>

Read on for today’s interview with Susan Dorson &amp; Amy Weitzman, two local moms on a mission to save their community library and provide parents with an eco-friendly, affordable shopping option via The Little Fox Shop. Then go ahead and nominate yourself or a friend!
Christine: Welcome, Susan and Amy! You were nominated for this feature because of the work you have done to start The Little Fox Shop at the Edith Fox Branch Library in East Arlington, where all proceeds go to support the library (whose doors have been on the verge of closing for some time due to budget cuts). Now, everyone (present company included) talks about the importance of preserving local libraries, but your efforts truly walk the walk. What inspired you to action to help save the Fox Branch?
Susan: I have always loved the Fox Library but when I was pregnant with my first son, I would take daily walks up to the Fox and chat with the librarians and it became a part of my life. After my son was born, there were days when I was very lonely but I knew that my local library was a place I could find people to talk to - and of course books. The thing about a branch library is that it is more than just a place to get books; it is a community gathering place. Owing in part to the smaller population that the Fox serves, you can see the same faces each week, you can network and go to events, and it becomes central to your life. I couldn't see this taken away from me, my children, or my neighborhood. The main branch is wonderful but to be able to walk into a place and have everybody know your name....well, that's special.
Amy: When Susan asked me be to part of a new children's secondhand store inside the library, I didn't hesitate to join her. I have always loved libraries and seriously considered becoming a school librarian a few years ago, but was disheartened when I saw that librarian positions were being eliminated at many schools around the country. Running the shop to save my local library seemed like the next best thing to me. Susan informed me that Arlington elementary schools no longer have librarians. The Fox Library will be the best way for my children to access the wealth of knowledge that librarians have on children's books and reading. That really motivated me. Also, the recycling aspect of the Little Fox is tremendously important to both Susan and me. When you buy a recycled item from the Little Fox instead of new from another store, the earth smiles.
Christine:How difficult was it to get this effort going? What was the rough timetable from conception to opening? Did the town of Arlington help with startup funds to spruce up the space and get your website going or was it all pieced together through friends and family? Some combination of both?
Susan &amp; Amy: Getting the Little Fox started took a lot of thinking and planning. The time from conception to opening was about 8 weeks. One of our most important goals was to create an atmosphere in which people would enjoy shopping and volunteering. We didn't receive any funds from the town, but they gave us the space and free reign over it. Almost nothing in the shop was purchased new. One of us would spy a good shelf on the curb for trash and haul it over to the shop. We would have "pizza night" at the store and our husbands and children would come and they would play while we worked. Friends would come with us to the shop and help us get ready for the opening as well. Susan has a really good eye for store design and has done most of the arranging and decorating of our physical space. Amy worked in advertising and software development before she had children, so she was able to create our website and organizes our online schedule of volunteers. Our different skill sets compliment each other very well.
One of the inspirations for the Little Fox was the PTO Thrift Store, which operated in the basement of the Fox Library for four years. It was a great success and many people in Arlington were sad to see it closing. They sold anything and everything, but we love and need kid stuff and decided to focus exclusively on children's items. We opened the same month the PTO Thrift Store closed, and they generously gave us many of their racks and shelving. Also, the librarians at both the Fox and Robbins Libraries have been wonderfully helpful and supportive.
Christine: What used to live in the space where The Little Fox shop now resides? Did you take before and after photos? From a design perspective, what transformed the space from (presumably) dingy storage space to what your nominator called a “hip thrift shop”?
Susan &amp; Amy: The space most recently held the Arlington Early Intervention program, which moved about a year ago. I don't think we have any before pictures, but it wasn't very appealing when we took over the space. While we wanted to repaint the entire space, that was one thing were weren't allowed to do, so it was all about distracting the eye from the beat-up beige walls; we used paintings, colorful decorations that hang from the wall and ceiling, and the items we are selling tend to come in bold, bright colors so that helps, too. We put stuffed animals out as decorations and created a clothesline on our most prominent wall to display seasonal items; right now we have Halloween costumes on that wall.
Christine: You sell kids' clothing, toys, baby gear, and maternity clothes. What have been some of your favorite, most amazing finds to walk in the door?
Amy: It's funny, the best "finds" are very personal. I love stuffed animals that are characters from books and get excited when a new one comes in, like Madeline or Snoopy.
Susan: I love when great gear shows up, like an almost new jogging stroller or a highly sought after Bumbo seat. I also get very excited about great books and particularly cute girls clothes (as I have two boys, I enjoy the chance to see all of the great girls things)! We recently got a Thomas Train table and I am waiting to see how long that will last.
Christine: Your nominator wrote, “Since opening this summer, Amy and Susan have opened a beautiful retail space, organized a small army of volunteers, and raised over $7,000!” Are you aware of what that money actually funds (e.g., staff, longer library hours, utilities, etc.)? Meaning, roughly, what does it take to keep a small but thriving branch library open for business?
Susan &amp; Amy: The library costs approximately $90,000 per year to operate, although closing it wouldn't save the town nearly that much, as most of the salary costs of the senior staff positions would simply be transferred to the cost of operating the main library. Our goal is to raise enough money to keep the town from considering The Fox a liability.
Christine: Clearly, your efforts are paying off and the shop is growing. Where are your greatest areas of need for volunteers? How can people get involved to help? What kind of commitment is involved?
Susan &amp; Amy: We are constantly amazed at the quality and dedication of our volunteers, but we can always use more. Since many of the volunteers who run the shop are also moms, their availability can change at a moment's notice; when something in their household changes, whether it is a shift in childcare arrangements or a new job for themselves or their partner. We also have a few retired people working at the shop and they are a great help since they are able to work hours that are difficult for those with young families to volunteer (like pickup time at the elementary schools). Working at the Little Fox is fun! If you worked retail as a young person, running the register can bring back memories. For retired people, the Little Fox can be a low-key workplace and a place to socialize. Our volunteers work as little as once a month for a couple of hours or 2-3 hours each week; it's completely up to them. See the volunteer page of our website for more information on volunteering at the shop.
Christine: You’re both mothers of two children. How do you juggle your efforts with The Little Fox Shop with parenting? Do your children come to work with you?
Susan &amp; Amy: Susan often brings her children to the store while she works. Sometimes she lets them borrow books or small toys from the shop as an incentive, but most of the time they are happy to be there since it's a toy store where they can play with all of the toys! Amy is able to work in the store with her older daughter who is 4 1/2, but not very well with her younger girl, who is 18 months old (she likes to wander out the door)! Amy's husband works at home, so she often runs over to the store during her younger daughter's nap or works the evening shift on Wednesday while her husband makes dinner and puts the kids to bed. The summer was a challenging time to start the store since our kids were home with us full-time, but now that we have volunteers running the store much of the time, things have gotten much easier for us and our families. And it helps that we both live within walking distance of the store.
Christine: I truly find your efforts so commendable and I wonder whether one or both of you have strong roots in community service. Is this work part of a long history of helping others?
Susan &amp; Amy: We definitely love to help others. Susan's background is in Macro Social Work, which means working with groups and populations on issues that they face; one facet of that is community organizing of which there is a strong element at the Little Fox. For the past 2 years, Amy has been running the Arlington Parents List, an email list with over 1500 local parents. Before that, she taught a basic computer skills class for low-income mothers. We also have a strong interest in recycling, and the fact that we are helping families to reuse and recycle is important to us.
Christine: We’ve talked exclusively about The Little Fox Shop until now. We’d love to know more about you both; give us a snapshot of your history and interests.
Susan: A snapshot of my history? That is tough. OK, very quick. I grew up the daughter of two ministers learning about helping to give to our community and protecting our world. In college I majored in psychology and then afterwards worked in children's theater with a focus on social issues. As I said before, my graduate degree is in Macro Social Work (from BU). My interests are making everything around me better....maybe that is too ambitious?! In reality I love to read, camp, bike, and go on adventure with my family. I love to be challenged and am relishing my experiences in starting a non-profit!
Amy: I grew up in Texas and California, but came to Boston as a freshman at BU. I majored in English Literature but added a Computer Science minor at the last minute so I'd be able to find a job when I graduated! My husband and I love to travel and have tried to continue to explore the world, even though we now take up more than one row on an airplane. I enjoy making paper collage and reading crafty blogs. I also have been known to stay up half the night reading a book. Text the word "novel" to the number 41411 to get a list of my favorite books. Try it, it really works!
Susan: As a Boston mama I love the fact that there is so much to do. I can take my children to festivals, fairs, concerts, and museums or just bike on the Esplanade, sail on lakes and rivers, or explore the parks. If you can't find something to do or somewhere to go, you simply aren't trying hard enough!
Amy: Playgrounds and sandwiches. I'm not kidding, Boston has the best sandwiches. We love to get a great sandwich and eat it while the kids play at the playground. Most of our favorite places for sandwiches are in Cambridge, but we have been known to get a pizza and walk to Spy Pond right here in Arlington and watch the sun go down as the girls play with stones on the edge of the water.</span></div></div>

The most common ATPases (24 proteins) contain the classical mononucleotide-binding motif, which is known as the P-loop or Walkermotif. A second subfamily exists as the GHL ATPase family, including Hsp90, PMS2, MutL and DNA gyrase B, and share the same left-handed β-α-β-fold. Four conserved sequence motifs have been identified in these enzymes. Finally, β-actin, Hsp70 and FtsA contain a more complex nucleotide-binding site and form the third and last subfamily of ATPases. The presence of various types of nucleotide-binding site in ATPases is of interest for drug discovery, as it might allow the design of compounds that specifically target only one type.
The class of Heat-shock proteins (Hsps; EC 3.6.-.-), the molecular chaperones, comprises five major and broadly conserved families: Hsp100s, Hsp90s, Hsp70s, Hsp60s, and small heat shock proteins (sHsps). The stress proteins are typically named after their molecular size in kilodaltons. They are required for the correct folding and maintenance of client proteins in biologically active conformations, and to stabilize them against heat stress and toxic chemicals (particularly heavy metals). Although Hsps are ubiquitously expressed proteins, increased expression of Hsps in a stressed cell is mediated primarily by so-called heat shock transcription factors (HSFs, 1-4). Hsps bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and ATP hydrolysis is required for its function, and is the key driving force for conformational conversions within the chaperone. Although inactive heat shock proteins exhibit weak to nonexistent ATPase activity, the presence of a substrate peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsps, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis,. In addition, a variety of co-chaperones, immunophilins, and other proteins are involved in the Hsp90-mediated protein folding pathway.

The price of the kit includes 1 Litre of our Palladium Tank Plating Solution which contains 6 grams of palladium per litre and can be shipped outside the UK and EU, making it a good substitute for our transport restricted rhodium and platinum plating processes.
Our Palladium Tank Plating Solution deposits a bright white, hard-wearing layer of palladium and is an excellent alternative to rhodium for re-plating white gold wedding and engagement rings. Another notable feature of our palladium plating system is that you can safely palladium plate items of jewellery that include materials such as pearl or coral without having to mask them out, as our Palladium Tank Plating Solution will not etch materials made from calcium carbonate. This was the case with the pearl and silver pendant in the picture; the whole of the pendant, pearls included, was immersed in our Palladium Plating Solution without any negative effect on the pearls. For a guide to setting up your Palladium Tank Plating Kit you can follow the same instructions for our Rhodium Tank Plating Kit which can be found in our Electroplating Manual by clicking HERE.
This kit (or any of our other kits, equipment or solutions) is not suitable for plating on to aluminium or titanium and therefore can’t be used to plate iPhones and other similar products. If you are planning on palladium tank plating on to copper and its alloys including brass and bronze you’ll need to brush plate a barrier layer of gold flash to protect your tank plating solution.
In between uses of your palladium tank plating solution, it’s a good idea to cover your solution with cling film to stop particles of duct and hair getting in as this will over time shorten the life of your solution. It will also reduce the frequency of having to filter your solution.
Stepped voltage controlled via a selector switch enabling a range from 3 up to 12 volts. Maximum current is 3.0 amps. Perfect for powering the cleaning stage, removing the need to re-set the settings on your MF Rectifier from cleaning to plating.
Palladium plating solution is agitated with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the beaker during plating. Mechanical agitation is a safer alternative to air agitation, as it eradicates any risk of the aerosol effect of the rhodium tank plating solution. Mechanical agitation keeps the plating solution moving over the surface of the item being plated in a consistent way, again maximising the efficiency of the tank plating process. Mechanical agitation avoids unnecessary oxidisation of the metal plating solution that air agitation will cause.
Made bespoke from solid stainless steel and designed to be used in conjunction with the Plating Arm Clamp Fully conductive. Will not corrode and contaminate palladium tank plating solution. When used with clamp, can be moved up or down the stand in any position to fit any size of plating beaker.
The advertised kit is using the 250ml kit. If you want to upsize to the 1 litre kit, you will need to remove the 250ml Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 250ml Beaker, Stirring Bar (Mini) and 250ml of Palladium Tank Plating Solution from the kit list.
You will then need to add the 1 Litre Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 1 Beaker, Stirring Bar (Medium) and 1 litre of Palladium Tank Plating Solution.</span></div></div>

Upon its opening, we’re acquainted with three young flies, led by Nat McFly (as in “Think, McFly, think…” to steal a Back to the Future quote) who decide to tag along on Buzz Aldrin’s legendary Apollo 11 rocket mission in 1969. Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts.
This is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have "the right stuff."</span></div></div>

Today we see an increased work load of mental health professionals, increased occurrences of abuse or violence faced by social workers and other therapists, and the terrible struggles facing our returning veterans. All of these things have increased our awareness of the stressful elements of our society and the impact those elements have on both our clients and the professionals whose job it is to help.
As a social worker I am aware of the impact of work related stress on me, my family and my ability to do my job effectively. In my exploration of this topic, I found the blog of a young British social worker who wrote a blog called “Fighting Monsters.” She has since closed the blog, for personal reasons she did not disclose. But I was very struck by the quote she references while explaining the name of her blog.
“Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.” Nietzsche.
For her that was about the monster “mental disorder and illness.” For me it applies to all of the various ways we want to help and give care. If we don’t pay attention, we will fall into the very trap we are trying to help our clients climb out of. Stress, anxiety and depression are the most common warnings of the beginning fall. As professionals who work to support clients facing any number of difficult challenges, we need to be sure we have the appropriate tools to manage stress. But knowing stress is a problem and doing something about it are frequently two different things. It’s a bit of the forest from the trees problem. When we are standing in the middle of the stress we really think we are handling it quite well. If we can step back a few steps, we frequently find that we are doing a pretty poor job of it.
The most amazing part of this discussion, is that everything we use when we talk with clients are things that are available to us as professionals – and vice versa. Everything we talk about in these articles on stress are important for clients and therapists alike. There are four important elements in any stress management approach – TALK, WRITE, THINK, MOVE. The next four posts will take them on.</span></div></div>
