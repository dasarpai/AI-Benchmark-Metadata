I had chest pain and dizziness several months ago and went to cardiology for tests. Stress echo was normal, though the symptoms were still made worse with the exercise. I was sent for a CT scan with contrast. No blockages or abnormalities. They did find a small hiatal hernia. I asked if that could cause chest pain and they reluctantly admitted that it could. I say reluctantly because despite my results being normal, she wanted to put me on a stronger statin. Ive been on statins for years and it has impaired my glucose tolerance. Rather than go on Metformin, I opted to go on strict low carb diet, monitor my glucose and lots of walking. Ive done that for two years and Im almost back in to anormal A1C. Ive worked very hard. I also switched from Simvastatin to Pravastatin. The latter has some preliminary findings suggesting it doesn't effect glucose tolerance as strongly. One of the worst statins for this...is Crestor. The cardiac nurse is convinced that I need to be on it. So I tried it for a month and surprise - my glucose is impaired again. (Morning was usually 160 at worst, two days ago it was 300. My diet has not changed.) I said no thanks to the Crestor and asked to be put back on Pravastatin. Nurse was really pushing back saying its still worth the risk because my cholesterol was too high on the Pravastin. I agreed to double my dose of it until we sort out this dispute. I get a call today from the cardiologist resident who was approached by the RN about my refusal to take Crestor. I get the same spiel about how its worth the risk. I explain patiently that A) I show no signs of heart disease. B)that my chest pain was very likely the hiatal hernia (which will be addressed separately)C) That although I understand their logic, I have worked very hard to keep my Diabetes controlled without Metformin. The common side effects of which (fecal incontinence and nausea) Ive seen with my sister and would very much like to avoid. Cardio Resident says she will \&quot;consult Endocrinology but they will likely say the same thing\&quot;. Add to this that Im on Testosterone Cypionate , which she says can cause the triglycerides to read high. I told her to make sure she mentions this when she talks to the Endo. I feel like I am being forced onto a medication that I dont consent to.

Since youre only 37 and they are pushing statins pretty hard, I would assume that your cholesterol sucks and you almost certainly should be on atorvastatin or rosuvastatin if it is being recommended by two cardiology providers.

If your chest pain was worse with exercise, its concerning for micro vascular disease, with a normal CT.Overall while statins do increase glucose intolerance, they overall have a net benefit in decreasing risk of heart attack and stroke. While your glucose numbers may change, its less about the glucose numbers and more about reducing downstream effects.It is kind of silly frankly to avoid metformin without knowing if youll have GI side effects or not.

Its important to mention any at all, though, so the previous report can be compared to any future ones (among other reasons). The reason theres a lot of could not assess...poor visualization all over the report is because this was a transthoracic echo. If they need better visualization of those structures, they would need to do a transesophageal echo which is a really not-fun procedure which requires you to be sedated, and is usually reserved for people with high suspicion for infective endocarditis or severe cardiac disease involving the poorly visualized structures.The rest of the findings could be related to pulmonary arterial HTN, which youve already mentioned. PAH is not the same as hypertension in general. The lung circulation is separate from the systemic circulation (though obviously the two are connected) and PAH is usually due to changes in the lung structure or function. For example, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs), or - my attendings personal favorite underdog in the world of heart/lung issues - sleep apnea.The full report of any diagnostic study, like an echo, is always going to have something that doesnt sound completely normal in it - the wonderful world of incidental findings.

These findings arent really consistent with RHD. The mitral valve is slightly thickened, which may be the result of the rheumatic fever, but the report does not show mitral stenosis (the expected consequence of RHD).What Id recommend doing is writing down the findings youve seen on the report, including your concerns about what they could mean, and other good questions youve asked in your post here (like about pulmonary artery hypertension, and the poor visualization of certain structures on the echo and how important these inconclusive findings would be to a diagnosis) and take them with you to the next appointment. Because your cardiologist has a more complete picture of your clinical presentation and other health info, they are the best person to help guide you through the report, why they do not feel this echo has shown the underlying problem, and the next steps to take.Best of luck to you, and thank you for the question!

Thank you for such a detailed response!So, the echo actually wasn't done specifically to look for Rheumatic heart disease -- that's just something I thought might be relevant or related to the problems I've been having. It was primarily done because I've been having these periodic attacks of such severe fatigue I can barely get out of bed, and when I do manage to get myself upright, I get out of breath and heart-poundy with even the slightest exertion, and am just generally extremely weak and disoriented -- I can't lift my arm over my head for more than a couple seconds, can't stay standing very long without sitting or leaning heavily on something, etc... and if I try to fight it and actually KEEP myself upright and moving around for more than a minute or two -- ie, to take a shower -- it quickly progresses to my heart feeling like it's gonna pound out of my chest, then nausea + room violently spinning, very rapidly followed by syncope. I'm not sure if it's full or partial syncope because I'm not sure if only being \&quot;out\&quot; for a few seconds or so qualifies as full syncope or just partial -- but I definitely black out briefly and collapse, and then spend awhile feeling violently sick and dizzy and shaky (and cold-sweaty) after I come back to. These \&quot;attacks\&quot; (episodes? Not really sure what to call them) come and go, but when they happen, they generally last about a week (roughly 3-4 days of being really bad, then another 3-4 days of recovery before I'm relatively back to normal again.) I've figured out that my Adderall prescription seemed to be a primary trigger for these attacks, so I've recently quit taking that altogether, and I'm hoping that will drastically reduce the attacks... but they've definitely happened at other times even without any triggers that I've been able to pinpoint, so it's not the Adderall that was CAUSING it (also it didn't happen every time I took the Adderall, which is why it took awhile to pinpoint that being a huge trigger) -- there's something underlying that's going on, and the Adderall just seemed to trigger whatever that \&quot;something\&quot; is. But I'm not sure what it is that triggers them other times.So, my cardiology workup was primarily to try to figure out what the hell is going on with me as far as all that. I was honestly really hoping the answers here would be along the lines of \&quot;yes, something DEFINITELY got overlooked or mixed up, you need to call and insist on a follow-up appointment and let your doctor know he effed up and x, y, and z needs to be immediately looked into further\&quot;. I mean I'm not looking for a malpractice suit or anything, I understand mistakes can happen... but I just really wanted to hear that it WAS a mistake, because I'm SO. FED.

And I haven't been able to work for those three years because jobs just fire me for having to call in too often. And despite three years of endless appointments and efforts, I feel like I'm still no closer to having any answers... so I was REALLY hoping this would finally provide some. I would rather have an upsetting diagnosis at this point, than continue having NO diagnosis at all. Knowing what IS wrong would be so much more useful than just knowing one more thing that isn't -- once I know what IS wrong, I can actually get a treatment plan going for it, and maybe I can finally start getting my life back on track. I used to be super active -- worked full-time in a restaurant, on my feet running around 40 hours a week; spent my free time riding bikes, hiking, and gardening, as much as possible... and now I can barely do any of that. Very short hikes, small amounts of gardening... but none of the rest. I want my life back.Or worst case scenario, with a diagnosis I could at least apply for disability, if getting my life back isn't an option, and have some meager bit of income again, anyway. I could start processing the fact that getting my life back close to where it was before just isn't gonna happen, and deal with that, instead of holding out some hope of being able to be \&quot;fixed\&quot; -- at least somewhat -- once I finally know what's wrong. With answers, I could at least do SOMETHING. With no answers, my life just stays in this shitty limbo indefinitely. And I really, really thought this was going to be what finally gave me some answers. It 100% FEELS like it's my heart that's the root of my problems... and I was even about 2/3rds through one of the attack weeks when I had the echo done, so I thought for sure it would show something while I was right in the midst of it, especially. So I just can't wrap my head around how everything could be \&quot;basically normal.\&quot;I suppose that all wasn't exactly clear in my \&quot;symptoms\&quot; summary -- I was just trying to rush through and get to the echo results, and didn't really feel like typing out the whole story -- so I just figured \&quot;fatigue/syncope/malaise\&quot; would cover the gist of it.I do really appreciate your response, though... I just wish it was what I actually wanted to hear. I just don't know how much more I can take of hearing \&quot;nothing seems to be wrong\&quot; when something is so obviously, seriously wrong.

I was just looking back at bloodwork from ER visit in December and noticed Anion Gap was 1/mol/L but Albumin was normal 3.9 and total protein normal 7.2. The Dr didn't mention this to me. And just saw this now. So worried about Multiple Myeloma now. My sodium was low 131 and SGPT (ALT) was low 12. The only thing they mentioned was elevated Hgb 15.5 and Het 46.3% but said nothing to worry about. Can anyone give their opinion. Ive also been to the gastroenterologist and cardiologist, upper endoscopy and colonoscopy normal and all cardiology tests were clear just showed some palpitations upon exertion.. ### Response: Multiple myeloma usually has high calcium, kidney disease, anemia (low blood count) and bone disease. You mentioned none of those. Low anion gap is hardly used in the emergency setting, and usually will need retesting if blood to see if it was a one time occurrence..&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Thank you for the response.

I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam.

It makes me cough and I breathe in to get it to stop. I can also slightly feel them in my lower neck beating. I also woke up this morning a little weak in that area. It freaks me out.I have some slight occasional pinching just like I do with the other palpitations (Im told that can be normal ) but Im not in pain. I dont have a headache. My blood sugar is normal. My bpm is normal. My blood pressure is a little lower than where it usually sits but its still in the range.Im seeing a NP on Monday but I wanted to ask if anyone has experienced this or knows what it might be before I get told its just anxiety again.Disclaimer: Im not saying it cant be anxiety but every time I go to the doctor EVERYTHING under the sun is anxiety and its hard to get past that diagnoses when you feel like something is off. ### Response: The workup youve had is incredibly thorough and it couldnt find anything pathological. Short of a heart attack (which is almost impossible at your age) there wouldnt be any significant changes to your cardiac physiology since that battery of tests was done.Anxiety is by far the most likely cause.From the sounds of it, it is probably anxiety..&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I (24F) had an ekg done yesterday to investigate consistently high blood pressure (around 140/85 or higher) and both high (122bpm) and low (53bpm) heart rates.

(I know it's only the sponges, as the welts are in perfect circles)I've identified the electrodes as Ambu WhiteSensor 4535M https://www.ambu.co.uk/cardiology/ecg-electrodes/product/ambu-whitesensor-4535mThe data sheet says the sponge is material is \&quot;polyester polyurethane reticulated\&quot;. Google tells me these are two different materials? Is there a common name for this stuff that doctors use, and is it a common medical material that I need to look out for in future?. ### Response: Acrylate allergy is most likely followed by nickel next..&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:48,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;65M, 5'9\&quot;, 140lbs, Asian / Chinese, NYC, no medications <-- My Dad's InfoI'm in a stressful medical situation right now, and need some help / advise.

He was in the OR for ~11 hours because they first attempted to repair a part of the ascending aorta, took him off bypass, saw that things weren't going well, then put him back on bypass again to do a more aggressive procedure of replacing the aortic valve and the ascending aorta including the arch, so it was a very long amt of time on bypass.Yesterday he was moved from the Cardiothoracic ICU and into a normal hospital wing due to a bed shortage in the ICU. I've noticed since he came out of surgery that he has a facial muscular abnormality on his left side (his left mouth is slanted up) and is having difficulty speaking/writing (he is slow to utter syllables, is misspelling very easy English and Chinese words, can't pronounce English and Mandarin words to the point where it is not possible to have a conversation with him without both my mom and I guessing while he attempts to partially speak / write). The cardiology team told me yesterday that they don't think they need to bring neurology in to examine him because it may all be normal effects of the bypass.

This is a very safe procedure, so I'd suggest it as a good next step to get all the important information your doctor needs..&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:57,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;3f 3ft tall 34lbs No medications Medical history: Uncomplicated pregnancy and no complications during delivery (vaginal) VSD and heart murmur present at birth but resolved on its own and was cleared by cardiology at age 2 She does have sensory issues and possibly autism were awaiting evaluation.We play doctor a lot because going to the Dr has always been something shes had a hard time with and when I was checking her mouth I noticed she had some red dots on the inside of her cheeks.

(She using an OTC pulse ox to measure.) She has a cardiology appt but not until March and a PCP appt but not until April since she's at school and it's a new provider. What to do? Is this a on call nurse sort of issue? Or a trip to the ED? Or wait till tomorrow and try for an early appt? Try a couple of Valsalvas? Wait it out until her cardio appt? Or?

Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: My daughter ( F, 18 y/o, 5'5', 165lbs) has been feeling poorly for a 6-8 months. She had COVID a couple of months ago and symptoms have are much worse in the last month or so. Symptoms seem POTS-like. She feels light headed, breathless, dizzy, HR goes from ~65 lying down to ~155-160 on standing. Today she tells me HR has been around 170 all day and she feels really lousy. (She using an OTC pulse ox to measure.) She has a cardiology appt but not until March and a PCP appt but not until April since she's at school and it's a new provider. What to do? Is this a on call nurse sort of issue? Or a trip to the ED? Or wait till tomorrow and try for an early appt? Try a couple of Valsalvas? Wait it out until her cardio appt? Or? She's away at school if Boston, what to do? Thank you. ### Response: If she actually has a HR of 170 that is accurate, ongoing and persistent, she needs to be seen in the ED immediately..</span></div></div>

Drink occasionally; previous occasional smoker but quit ~5 years ago. Same for recreational drugs -- on occasion when I was younger, but none for at least 5 years. I had previously been diagnosed with Rheumatic Fever in 2015, which seems VERY relevant here, but every doctor I've tried to discuss it with brushes it off when I mention it.So, last month I finally got a referral to a cardiologist, after years of trying to get one, and I was given a heart monitor to wear at home for two weeks, and then on Dec 23rd I had an echocardiogram ultrasound done. After trying and failing to get ahold of them by phone, Friday I FINALLY received a letter in the mail with my results. The front page of that letter states that all my tests were normal, and no follow-up is needed.THEN, that same letter goes on to detail in the next few pages that I have a small left ventricle, sinus tachycardia with an average heartbeat ranging from 90-150 bpm, paradoxical septal motion, mild pulmonary valve regurgitation, a thickened mitral valve, mild mitral valve regurgitation, trivial tricuspid valve regurgitation, and then it states that my "right ventricular systolic pressure could not be estimated due to inability to detect peak tricuspid regurgitation" and that my pulmonary valve stats were also inconclusive due to "poor visualization".The "inconclusives" I suppose could go either way, and I don't know if those are something I should try to get more testing for to clear up or not. But the rest definitely does not sound "normal" to me, and based on a quick Google search most of those things seem to be more common in someone who has had previous cardiac surgery, which I have not, and/or they usually go hand-in-hand with severe pulmonary hypertension, and as previously mentioned, my blood pressure has been consistently LOW, to the point of being almost abnormally so, for at least the past year.So, is there anyone who can confirm that all those abnormalities could be found, while still falling within the "normal" range of test results?

Trivial and trace and mild regurgitation are seen in one or more valves of (what I estimate to be) the vast majority of healthy people. The regurgitation is only really abnormal if its significant (moderate or severe). Its important to mention any at all, though, so the previous report can be compared to any future ones (among other reasons). The reason theres a lot of could not assess...poor visualization all over the report is because this was a transthoracic echo. If they need better visualization of those structures, they would need to do a transesophageal echo which is a really not-fun procedure which requires you to be sedated, and is usually reserved for people with high suspicion for infective endocarditis or severe cardiac disease involving the poorly visualized structures.The rest of the findings could be related to pulmonary arterial HTN, which youve already mentioned. PAH is not the same as hypertension in general. The lung circulation is separate from the systemic circulation (though obviously the two are connected) and PAH is usually due to changes in the lung structure or function. For example, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs), or - my attendings personal favorite underdog in the world of heart/lung issues - sleep apnea.The full report of any diagnostic study, like an echo, is always going to have something that doesnt sound completely normal in it - the wonderful world of incidental findings. Thats why its important to go by what the cardiologist or other ordering physician interprets from the echo. Its also why every diagnostic report has a disclaimer along the lines of correlate with clinical findings. In the context of your presentation, the echo that you had done was essentially normal. Its what my own echo report said despite results that could have been used to diagnose someone with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had they been a 68 year old with blood pressure of 155/100 for the past 25 years, extra heart sounds, and shortness of breath.Your echo was done, I presume, to look for rheumatic heart disease in the context of your clinical findings (which could be consistent with that, though its rare to get this from only having rheumatic fever once). These findings arent really consistent with RHD. The mitral valve is slightly thickened, which may be the result of the rheumatic fever, but the report does not show mitral stenosis (the expected consequence of RHD).What Id recommend doing is writing down the findings youve seen on the report, including your concerns about what they could mean, and other good questions youve asked in your post here (like about pulmonary artery hypertension, and the poor visualization of certain structures on the echo and how important these inconclusive findings would be to a diagnosis) and take them with you to the next appointment. Because your cardiologist has a more complete picture of your clinical presentation and other health info, they are the best person to help guide you through the report, why they do not feel this echo has shown the underlying problem, and the next steps to take.Best of luck to you, and thank you for the question! Echo reports are always confusing and concerning to many who arent aware that many of the abnormal findings are often normal variants, so this is a great post to discuss that with.</span></div></div>

The mitral valve is slightly thickened, which may be the result of the rheumatic fever, but the report does not show mitral stenosis (the expected consequence of RHD).What Id recommend doing is writing down the findings youve seen on the report, including your concerns about what they could mean, and other good questions youve asked in your post here (like about pulmonary artery hypertension, and the poor visualization of certain structures on the echo and how important these inconclusive findings would be to a diagnosis) and take them with you to the next appointment. Because your cardiologist has a more complete picture of your clinical presentation and other health info, they are the best person to help guide you through the report, why they do not feel this echo has shown the underlying problem, and the next steps to take.Best of luck to you, and thank you for the question! Echo reports are always confusing and concerning to many who arent aware that many of the abnormal findings are often normal variants, so this is a great post to discuss that with..</span></div></div>

Thank you for such a detailed response!So, the echo actually wasn't done specifically to look for Rheumatic heart disease -- that's just something I thought might be relevant or related to the problems I've been having. It was primarily done because I've been having these periodic attacks of such severe fatigue I can barely get out of bed, and when I do manage to get myself upright, I get out of breath and heart-poundy with even the slightest exertion, and am just generally extremely weak and disoriented -- I can't lift my arm over my head for more than a couple seconds, can't stay standing very long without sitting or leaning heavily on something, etc... and if I try to fight it and actually KEEP myself upright and moving around for more than a minute or two -- ie, to take a shower -- it quickly progresses to my heart feeling like it's gonna pound out of my chest, then nausea + room violently spinning, very rapidly followed by syncope. I'm not sure if it's full or partial syncope because I'm not sure if only being "out" for a few seconds or so qualifies as full syncope or just partial -- but I definitely black out briefly and collapse, and then spend awhile feeling violently sick and dizzy and shaky (and cold-sweaty) after I come back to. These "attacks" (episodes? Not really sure what to call them) come and go, but when they happen, they generally last about a week (roughly 3-4 days of being really bad, then another 3-4 days of recovery before I'm relatively back to normal again.) I've figured out that my Adderall prescription seemed to be a primary trigger for these attacks, so I've recently quit taking that altogether, and I'm hoping that will drastically reduce the attacks... but they've definitely happened at other times even without any triggers that I've been able to pinpoint, so it's not the Adderall that was CAUSING it (also it didn't happen every time I took the Adderall, which is why it took awhile to pinpoint that being a huge trigger) -- there's something underlying that's going on, and the Adderall just seemed to trigger whatever that "something" is. But I'm not sure what it is that triggers them other times.So, my cardiology workup was primarily to try to figure out what the hell is going on with me as far as all that. I was honestly really hoping the answers here would be along the lines of "yes, something DEFINITELY got overlooked or mixed up, you need to call and insist on a follow-up appointment and let your doctor know he effed up and x, y, and z needs to be immediately looked into further". I mean I'm not looking for a malpractice suit or anything, I understand mistakes can happen... but I just really wanted to hear that it WAS a mistake, because I'm SO. FED. UP. with these goddamn symptoms.I have been in and out of doctor appointments CONSTANTLY for three years now. And I haven't been able to work for those three years because jobs just fire me for having to call in too often. And despite three years of endless appointments and efforts, I feel like I'm still no closer to having any answers... so I was REALLY hoping this would finally provide some. I would rather have an upsetting diagnosis at this point, than continue having NO diagnosis at all. Knowing what IS wrong would be so much more useful than just knowing one more thing that isn't -- once I know what IS wrong, I can actually get a treatment plan going for it, and maybe I can finally start getting my life back on track. I used to be super active -- worked full-time in a restaurant, on my feet running around 40 hours a week; spent my free time riding bikes, hiking, and gardening, as much as possible... and now I can barely do any of that. Very short hikes, small amounts of gardening... but none of the rest. I want my life back.Or worst case scenario, with a diagnosis I could at least apply for disability, if getting my life back isn't an option, and have some meager bit of income again, anyway. I could start processing the fact that getting my life back close to where it was before just isn't gonna happen, and deal with that, instead of holding out some hope of being able to be "fixed" -- at least somewhat -- once I finally know what's wrong. With answers, I could at least do SOMETHING. With no answers, my life just stays in this shitty limbo indefinitely. And I really, really thought this was going to be what finally gave me some answers. It 100% FEELS like it's my heart that's the root of my problems... and I was even about 2/3rds through one of the attack weeks when I had the echo done, so I thought for sure it would show something while I was right in the midst of it, especially. So I just can't wrap my head around how everything could be "basically normal."I suppose that all wasn't exactly clear in my "symptoms" summary -- I was just trying to rush through and get to the echo results, and didn't really feel like typing out the whole story -- so I just figured "fatigue/syncope/malaise" would cover the gist of it.I do really appreciate your response, though... I just wish it was what I actually wanted to hear. I just don't know how much more I can take of hearing "nothing seems to be wrong" when something is so obviously, seriously wrong. I know it's not psychosomatic; any doctor who tried to tell me it's "anxiety and/or depression" would probably find themself in possession of a brand new, shiny, second asshole by the time I was done with them... but this never-ending lack of answers does sometimes make me wonder if I'm going crazy.

Still heart rate isn't normal, and symptoms persist so there is still a problem. Now we now it isn't in the heart.

There are not-doctors that are thinking about POTS/dysautonomy, I came here to tell them they are not crazy, I also suspect that. However dysautonomy is diagnosed by discarding other illnesses, and with only the findings of an echocardiogram it cannot be diagnosed. I would ask with internal medicine for a second opinion and more tests, first you have to discard hypothyroidism (not likely), adrenal dysfunction and endocrine dysfunctions. The recommendations to better your symptoms are drinking more water, change positions slowly: if you are in crouch position stand up as slowly as you can, from laying down sit before you stand up.

Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative.

There is a known juvenile onset form that falls under "SoJIA" (Systemic-onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis), considered a version of Still's.OP, this sounds exactly like a form of arthritis to a clinician who takes care of children. I agree that what comes to mind for your mother as "arthritis" is likely too limited, and that definition might need to be expanded in her mind. Could you look at this, and maybe share it with her? https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritisAbout a third of the way down that page is the SYMPTOMS section, with subsections on Fever, Rash, and Joint Pain. Please read it and see if it rings a bell. Best wishes..</span></div></div>

But they insisted that I go to the ER if I feel like Im going to faint at any point and I was given an urgent referral to cardiology. How concerned should I be?Stats: 24F; very rarely drink, no cigarettes, no vaping, daily weed; Diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, and anxiety; Currently taking Trileptal 675mg and lexapro 10mg. ### Response: There are many types of heart block of various degrees of seriousness. It's not possible to say from this info what you have.</span></div></div>

I don't want her to get worse, but I'm also wanting to be as efficient as possible with the appointments since I'm on my own.. ### Response: When quality of life starts to decline, it is important to look at quality vs. quantity of life. If you want her to live as long as possible then yes she needs to continue to see her specialists unless they say it isn't necessary.If her goals are just peace, dignity and comfort rather than trying to extend life then focus on this instead. Her geriatrician can help with this..</span></div></div>
