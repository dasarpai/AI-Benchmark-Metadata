when they were enslaved, and Native Americans were referred to as \&quot;redskins.\&quot; \n\nIf a person is called by a name that they don't like or that is painful to hear, it can be seen as an act of depersonalization, akin to the way names were treated in the Holocaust, slavery, or colonialism.In a study on racial bias associated with names and pronouns, it was found that white characters with names like Connor and Garrett could be imagined as violent, while black characters with names like Darnell and DeShawn could be imagined as having tempers, which was incompatible with the amount of social prestige that they were imagined to have.This suggests that the way a name is pronounced can have a connection to the status that a person is imagined to have in society.[&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nSeveral reasons explain why it is considered racist to ask people how to pronounce their names.

more rural areas.Insurance companies see young drivers as a bigger risk because they are three times more likely to be in a fatal collision than drivers over 20.Additionally, moving violations such as

over the years, but none that have made a large difference in average phone calls.One advance is Voice over LTE, or VoLTE, which is an add-on to next-generation cellular systems that enables voice traffic to be carried over 4G LTE networks.This greatly improves voice call quality by compressing a voice call into a series of standardized packets that can travel between carriers and across national borders over an IP backbone, eliminating the need to convert the data into different formats for different parts of the system.So no information is lost.Another advance is HD voice, which allows for clearer voice calls and a significant decrease in background noise like street traffic and wind.This is limited currently though, as availability is only available to those with an HD voice-capable device and located within the HD voice coverage area.There are many other small advances that are possible, such as using multiple microphones, speakers, and enhanced audio processing in order to improve voice call quality.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;One reason phone call quality has not improved is that the base station/base station controller, now called eNodeB [for Evolved Node B] in LTE, is all-powerful.That is, eNodeB makes all of the decisions about how much bandwidth each handset gets no matter how good a channel connection a handset may have.Also, base station behaviors are not standardized—that is, no one really knows how they are making these decisions.They take into account how loaded the cell site is and how loaded adjacent cell sites are, plus other network data and other things when allocating bandwidth.A couple of rules providers appear to follow are: Don't drop a call in progress, and don't block any new calls if at all possible.This means that the base station allocates bandwidth conservatively, and thus the voice codec in the handset may operate at a lower than desirable rate.In contrast, cordless phones have it easy.They have only one primary function—voice calls—and their larger size lets them place their large microphones and speakers as close to your mouth and ear as possible.Smart phones, on the other hand, are a technological sausage, densely packed with cameras, radios, microprocessors, sensors, and other hardware that

nuclear power is just too expensive.Transitioning away from fossil fuels to nuclear power would not be a solution to climate change.While nuclear power may produce lower-carbon energy, this energy comes with a great deal of risk.Solar power, wind power, geothermal power, hybrid and electric cars, and aggressive energy efficiency are all climate solutions that are safer, cheaper, faster, more secure, and less wasteful than nuclear power.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nThe three main reasons why nuclear energy has not been used to generate electricity on a large scale are: environmental groups and the public's fear of meltdowns and weapon proliferation;

Just how the hell does the universe not have an edge?\n\nI've read a lot of the previous askscience and ELI5 responses to this, but none of them have really answered my, or it seemed like the OP's, questions. So let me explain what I think I understand and what I'm still wondering.\n \nThe most common response is that the universe is a like the surface of a balloon, which has no edge, that is expanding. Got it. One problem with this is that balloon's kind of do have \&quot;edges.\&quot; We can talk about the Earth not having an edge because it doesn't expand, but to say something is expanding is to say that it has a point of origin and is growing in some direction from there, so the place between when it's so far expanded and where it is heading towards is the edge, right? Is there a fourth spacial dimension that the Earth is expanding into? Am I just totally not thinking along the right lines here?\n \nBut in any case, most of the data seems to suggest that the universe is flat and *not* curved, like the balloon of infamy, right? So the answer in this case has been that the universe just goes on infinitely in all directions. But... how can this be if the universe started a finite amount of time ago and has been expanding at a finite speed? Besides, wouldn't an infinite universe need to have had infinite energy? Do we think there's infinite energy in the universe?\n \nA lot of the responses I read in previously questions were either too brief and completely unexplained, like, \&quot;the universe is infinite,\&quot; or generally unhelpful and a little... condescending frankly. (\&quot;I can't explain without using math. It's probably too complicated for you to understand.\&quot;) I don't consider myself to be an unintelligent person and I actually have a very active interest in astronomy, just having trouble swallowing this concept I suppose.\n \nI can even try to phrase this question in specific way to relate to what I don't understand about an edge-less universe: If no matter can travel faster than light and the speed of the expansion of the universe isn't yet faster than light, will a photon eventually outrun all of the expanding matter in a flat universe? If so, how far would it have to travel from a given point to get to that \&quot;edge\&quot;? If not, please, ELI5.&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The universe has been described as having no edge because, as one analogy puts it, it is like the surface of a balloon.An ant on such a surface could walk in any direction and it would appear to be unbounded (i.e.the ant might come back to where it started but there would be no end to the journey).This is analogous to the idea that the universe is expanding outward in all directions, with no \&quot;edge\&quot; because there is no outside to the universe.In terms of whether the universe actually is infinite, there is no definitive answer, as Stephen Hawking has said that it is still an open question.It might wrap around itself in a higher dimension in the same way that the 2D surface of a sphere wraps around itself in three dimensions.There are many different theories and ongoing attempts to resolve the question of whether the universe is like a sphere, curving back on itself so that if you travel in one direction you eventually return to your starting point.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To say that the universe is \&quot;flat\&quot; is not to say that it is flat in the same sense that a piece of paper is flat.Rather, it means that the geometry of the universe is such that parallel lines will never cross, the corners of cubes will always be right angles, and the sum of all angles in a triangle will always be 180 degrees, known as Euclidean Geometry.Furthermore, the universe is considered \&quot;flat\&quot; because its geometry is such that it is impossible to draw a straight line that will intersect with another line at any point.Other than the Earth, the universe is considered to be \&quot;flat\&quot; because, as far as we can tell, it is in balance between the amount of matter and energy it contains, and if it is in perfect balance, it will continue to expand forever at an increasingly slower rate.While our solar system formed from a giant spherical gas cloud, angular momentum caused the cloud to rotate, and material fell in along the poles instead of around the equator, because around the equator it had to battle against the centripetal acceleration trying to push it out again.Furthermore, the universe is defined by&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;zvpfmzfegwuxnfps&quot;},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Why does the government tax income much more heavily than spending?\n\n[removed]&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The government taxes income heavily because that is one way that they can get money to provide services for the people.Income taxes can be shifted to other people (such as the customer in a sales tax) but the income tax burden is always on the person paying the income tax.The government can also use income taxes to encourage certain behaviors.If the government wants to reduce the number of SUVs being sold, they can increase the taxes on those vehicles.The government uses income tax to make sure that the people who can afford to pay for services, actually do.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The issue with savings in the United States is not that people do not want to save, but rather that the government has made it very difficult to do so.The tax code, in it's present form, imposes multiple layers of taxation on capital, which reduces the incentives to save and invest, and creates a bias toward consumption.In addition, government programs, such as social security, remove the need to save for many people, as the government provides a safety net in the form of social security and other programs.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nAnswer: The government taxes income heavily in order to generate revenue for public services, shift the burden of taxation to other people, and incentivize certain behaviors.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;teviynastiplmskk&quot;},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Why are Swedish and Norwegian considered two different languages but are completely mutually intelligible, while Cantonese and Mandarin are dialects of Chinese but are mutually unintelligible?&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While many languages are mutually intelligible, there are a few notable examples where this is not the case, even between dialects of the same language.One of the most common examples is between Cantonese and Mandarin.Though both are considered Chinese dialects and not separate languages, speakers of both are not mutually intelligible.Instead, they will tell you that they speak the same language, which is why they are considered dialects of Chinese instead of different languages.A similar situation exists between Swedish and Norwegian.Though they are both considered Scandinavian languages, they are not mutually intelligible.This is likely due to the fact that they have diverged from the same language over time due to influences from neighboring languages.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The main reason that Swedish and Norwegian are considered different languages despite being mutually intelligible is that they have distinct, codified, standardized forms, with their own grammar books and literatures, which correspond to three separate nation states.This is not true of Cantonese and Mandarin, which are considered dialects of Chinese.Additionally, Scandinavian languages differ slightly in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary, although the differences are minor.Moreover, written Danish and Norwegian (Norwegian bokmål) are very similar, while written Swedish contains some words that a Dane or Norwegian wouldn't understand unless they knew them beforehand.In conclusion, this gives us the following equations: Norwegian + phonology – vocabulary = Swedish, Norwegian – phonology + vocabulary = Danish.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nThe answer can be rephrased as: Though Swedish and Norwegian are both considered Scandinavian languages, they are not mutually intelligible, unlike many other languages.

While I was lying there, I was looking at the reflection of my TV in the window and I couldn't make out anything that was going on.  So I put my glasses on and boom, clear as day.  Without my glasses, even if I put my face right up to the glass the image being reflected back was still blurry.  What's going on here?  Instinctively I feel that I should simply be able to make out whatever image is being reflected on the window regardless of my distance from the object.  So what's happening with my eyes and the reflected light that requires me to still wear my glasses to make out the reflection clearly?&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The light reflecting from a mirror gives the impression that the object is behind the mirror and you get this impression because the light having reflected from the mirror is moving exactly as if it were coming from an object behind the mirror.This is not just true of the direction of the light is travelling, but it's also how the light is spreading out.Some people may experience a distortion of their peripheral vision after receiving a new glasses prescription.This is a fairly common occurrence that can be a result of the adjustment period as your eyes get used to the new prescription.Glasses focus on the section of the visual field that is right in front of you, in order to help correct your vision and perception.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Your eyes' lenses actually do a very good job of focusing light to create a crisp image on your retina, with your own eyes muscles squeezing them so we can focus at different distances.When looking at a reflection in a mirror, light rays from the object being reflected travel in all directions, some of which will travel into the eye.The brain interprets this information and therefore thinks that the object being reflected is behind the mirror.As a result, unless the mirror is curved, the image of an object will actually appear to be close to the mirror and blurred.This is because the light having reflected from the mirror is moving exactly as if it were coming from an object behind the mirror.Finally, when an object appears far away, your eyes adapt and change the shape of their lens to accommodate for the distance between you and the object.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Without corrective lenses, the light reflecting from a distant object in a mirror is still blurry because the glasses are not able to focus on the peripheral vision, which is necessary to make out the reflection clearly.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:86,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ztvvpgoztuuzwofw&quot;},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Why does venting about stuff that frustrates you help you feel better about it\n\n[deleted]&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Venting your frustration can help you feel better.When you vent, you are Annoyed, irritated, and bothered.You have an overwhelming urge to \&quot;get it out\&quot; and talk about it.This helps you feel physically lighter.The problem is that venting inappropriately can make you feel worse.When you keep talking about what's bothering you, you fan the flames of negative feelings and keep them alive.This can lead to you claiming \&quot;victimhood\&quot; when you need to take action to rectify the situation.There is also evidence that venting can make you more angry and hostile.From an evolutionary perspective, anger is a response to threat.However, venting is a negative reinforcement process - anger and hostility are specific emotions, and venting begets more anger and hostility.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Venting frustration or anger can provide cathartic release and help you feel better by alleviating tension and stress.Although it is often viewed as a negative behavior, people who vent their frustrations, grievances, and disappointments are generally happier and less prone to depression.This is because when you share your perceived threats, indignities, misfortunes or injustices, you are connecting with someone who genuinely seems to care about you, which in turn provides comfort and consolation.Even more, a diary study conducted by Emmy Werner revealed that people who vent their frustrations are less likely to exhibit anti-social behavior and are more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior by helping and supporting others.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nVenting your frustration can help you feel better by allowing you to express your emotions and release the tension. It can also help you gain perspective on the situation and come up with solutions to address the problem. However, it is important to be mindful of how you vent, as it can lead to further negative feelings if done inappropriately.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hbjqgardpbxixzrn&quot;},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Does anyone know where the \&quot;* * *** **** **\&quot; clap came from?&quot;},&quot;ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The \&quot;* * *** **** **\&quot; clap comes from the custom of applauding after a performance.Humans clap with the palms of their hands, often quickly and repeatedly to express appreciation or approval.Some have said that clapping is like high-fiving yourself in a positive response to something that someone else has done.Clapping is the most common sound that we, as humans, use without our voice chords.We do it as a social gesture to show approval and admiration in groups, crowds, or by ourselves.Jay Fisher, a professor at Yale University, dates the custom to the third century BC, where (Greek?) plays ended with a request, plaudite, for the audience to clap.&quot;},&quot;generated_text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The clap is a slang term for a sexually transmitted disease (STD).The origin of the term may come from old English, in which \&quot;clappan\&quot; was used to describe a beating or throbbing.This could refer to the painful, burning urination or swelling in the penis or vagina caused by gonorrhea.A number of people believe that the name stems from a proposed medieval treatment of \&quot;clapping\&quot; the penis or slamming the penis between both hands (or a hard surface) to get rid of the discharge/pus.&quot;},&quot;rephrased_ground_truth&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nThe origin of the \&quot;* * *** **** **\&quot; clap is believed to date back to the third century BC, when plays ended with a request for the audience to clap.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Names hold power in the sense that they identify a person and serve as a link to their individual identity.As such, when people are asked how to pronounce their names, they are being asked to share a part of their identity that is intrinsic to their being.This can be seen in the way that Jews were referred to by numbers during the Holocaust, blacks were referred to as "cattle" when they were enslaved, and Native Americans were referred to as "redskins." 

If a person is called by a name that they don't like or that is painful to hear, it can be seen as an act of depersonalization, akin to the way names were treated in the Holocaust, slavery, or colonialism.In a study on racial bias associated with names and pronouns, it was found that white characters with names like Connor and Garrett could be imagined as violent, while black characters with names like Darnell and DeShawn could be imagined as having tempers, which was incompatible with the amount of social prestige that they were imagined to have.This suggests that the way a name is pronounced can have a connection to the status that a person is imagined to have in society.[</span></div></div>

In terms of the physical layout of the organ, 300 years ago the keyboard and pipes would have been much closer together than they are today. This is because the organ was powered by hand-pumped bellows, and the pipes had to be close enough to the keyboard for the bellows to be operated. Nowadays, the organ is powered by electric blowers, so the keyboard and pipes can be further apart. Additionally, modern organs often have wires and pipes running through the walls or under the floor, whereas in the past this would not have been necessary.</span></div></div>

I've read a lot of the previous askscience and ELI5 responses to this, but none of them have really answered my, or it seemed like the OP's, questions. So let me explain what I think I understand and what I'm still wondering.
 
The most common response is that the universe is a like the surface of a balloon, which has no edge, that is expanding. Got it. One problem with this is that balloon's kind of do have "edges." We can talk about the Earth not having an edge because it doesn't expand, but to say something is expanding is to say that it has a point of origin and is growing in some direction from there, so the place between when it's so far expanded and where it is heading towards is the edge, right? Is there a fourth spacial dimension that the Earth is expanding into? Am I just totally not thinking along the right lines here?
 
But in any case, most of the data seems to suggest that the universe is flat and *not* curved, like the balloon of infamy, right? So the answer in this case has been that the universe just goes on infinitely in all directions. But... how can this be if the universe started a finite amount of time ago and has been expanding at a finite speed? Besides, wouldn't an infinite universe need to have had infinite energy? Do we think there's infinite energy in the universe?
 
A lot of the responses I read in previously questions were either too brief and completely unexplained, like, "the universe is infinite," or generally unhelpful and a little... condescending frankly. ("I can't explain without using math. It's probably too complicated for you to understand.") I don't consider myself to be an unintelligent person and I actually have a very active interest in astronomy, just having trouble swallowing this concept I suppose.
 
I can even try to phrase this question in specific way to relate to what I don't understand about an edge-less universe: If no matter can travel faster than light and the speed of the expansion of the universe isn't yet faster than light, will a photon eventually outrun all of the expanding matter in a flat universe? If so, how far would it have to travel from a given point to get to that "edge"? If not, please, ELI5.</span></div></div>

First off, I've never been a mod and I do not speak from experience.

Second, the mods are not posting in the subreddit, and I don't know to what extent they are regulating this subreddit.  For all I know they're watching it all the time, I can't speak to that, but they certainly aren't posting at all.  

In my opinion, if you're posting a question that's been asked ten times.  Deleted.  If you can't be bothered to search, not our problem.  If you can't provide even a single question to your broad topic (e.g. ELI5: Physics, ELI5: Religion)?  Dele- ok, just warned.

I also think we should all, mods and non-mods alike, be contributing more to the Five-Year-Old's Guide to the Galaxy.  And reference people there as much as possible.  I think we should add warnings to the 'submit' page saying that they should search first, and if they fail to do so and submit a common topic, it will be deleted without warning.  I'm just giving a couple suggestions, I don't pretend to have this all figured out but there are definitely simple improvements which can be made. 

I know these rules and others are mentioned in the sidebar but I'd like to know how much they are being enforced.

Theres a post in r/personalfinance where OP and his coworker discuss how \[coworker\] refused  a $2000 bonus, as it would put him into the next tax bracket, and this would cause him to make less money over all - OP does not agree, and they went at it trying to prove the other wrong.

[Link to the thread in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/am2cv0/my_coworker_turned_down_a_200000_bonus_because_it/)

 &amp; #x200B;

Can anyone explain to me how this would work? In the original post, OP and his coworker found online articles supporting both arguments.

For the record, I believe you'd make more money over all, even if you were bumped into the next tax bracket, but I don't know why, its just what I've always understood.

My question is how does the body know? For example, how is working at night any different than moving from America to China?

While I was lying there, I was looking at the reflection of my TV in the window and I couldn't make out anything that was going on.  So I put my glasses on and boom, clear as day.  Without my glasses, even if I put my face right up to the glass the image being reflected back was still blurry.  What's going on here?  Instinctively I feel that I should simply be able to make out whatever image is being reflected on the window regardless of my distance from the object.  So what's happening with my eyes and the reflected light that requires me to still wear my glasses to make out the reflection clearly?</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Your eyes' lenses actually do a very good job of focusing light to create a crisp image on your retina, with your own eyes muscles squeezing them so we can focus at different distances.When looking at a reflection in a mirror, light rays from the object being reflected travel in all directions, some of which will travel into the eye.The brain interprets this information and therefore thinks that the object being reflected is behind the mirror.As a result, unless the mirror is curved, the image of an object will actually appear to be close to the mirror and blurred.This is because the light having reflected from the mirror is moving exactly as if it were coming from an object behind the mirror.Finally, when an object appears far away, your eyes adapt and change the shape of their lens to accommodate for the distance between you and the object.</span></div></div>

[deleted]</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Venting your frustration can help you feel better.When you vent, you are Annoyed, irritated, and bothered.You have an overwhelming urge to "get it out" and talk about it.This helps you feel physically lighter.The problem is that venting inappropriately can make you feel worse.When you keep talking about what's bothering you, you fan the flames of negative feelings and keep them alive.This can lead to you claiming "victimhood" when you need to take action to rectify the situation.There is also evidence that venting can make you more angry and hostile.From an evolutionary perspective, anger is a response to threat.However, venting is a negative reinforcement process - anger and hostility are specific emotions, and venting begets more anger and hostility.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Venting frustration or anger can provide cathartic release and help you feel better by alleviating tension and stress.Although it is often viewed as a negative behavior, people who vent their frustrations, grievances, and disappointments are generally happier and less prone to depression.This is because when you share your perceived threats, indignities, misfortunes or injustices, you are connecting with someone who genuinely seems to care about you, which in turn provides comfort and consolation.Even more, a diary study conducted by Emmy Werner revealed that people who vent their frustrations are less likely to exhibit anti-social behavior and are more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior by helping and supporting others.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">

Venting your frustration can help you feel better by allowing you to express your emotions and release the tension. It can also help you gain perspective on the situation and come up with solutions to address the problem. However, it is important to be mindful of how you vent, as it can lead to further negative feelings if done inappropriately.</span></div></div>

The origin of the "* * *** **** **" clap is believed to date back to the third century BC, when plays ended with a request for the audience to clap. This custom of applauding after a performance has been passed down through the generations and is now a common way to express appreciation or approval. Clapping is a social gesture that is done with the palms of the hands, often quickly and repeatedly, and is the most common sound we make without using our voice chords. It is a way to show admiration and approval in groups, crowds, or even by ourselves, similar to a high-five.</span></div></div>
