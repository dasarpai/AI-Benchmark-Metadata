Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin jackets
Laughin’ bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet shes braggin to all her friends, sayin youre so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks its special, but its all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when shes with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause lets be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her Uptown Girl
Youre singin it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse 
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks its special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs shes singing now when shes with you
Do you get déjà vu when shes with you?
Do you get déjà vu? 
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Dont act like we didnt do that shit, too
Youre tradin jackets like we used to do
Play her piano, but she doesnt know 
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel 
A different girl now, but theres nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu</span></div></div>

High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite</span></div></div>

Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover

And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
Youre my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed, youre never gonna grow
And its alright now
But we were something, dont you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And its another day waking up alone
But we were something, dont you think so?

Would everything be different today?
We were something, dont you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one</span></div></div>

Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says

If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you</span></div></div>

Even when we’d argue, wed not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
Ive made mistakes and made some choices, thats hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
Ive passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, Ill never say it
I dont wanna touch you, I dont wanna be
Just another ex-love you dont wanna see
I dont wanna miss you

I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldnt
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put em
Reputation precedes me, they told you Im crazy
I swear I dont love the drama, it loves me
And I cant let you go, your hand prints on my soul
Its like your eyes are liquor, its like your body is gold
Youve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So heres the truth from my red lips
I wanna be your end game 
I wanna be your first string

Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldnt give a reason

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke, Well, its made for me
How evergreen, our group of friends
Dont think well say that word again
And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls

One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just dont know the answer
Til someones on their knees and asks you
She wouldve made such a lovely bride
What a shame shes fucked in the head, they said
But youll find the real thing instead
Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing

Your moms ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You wont remember all my

You wont remember all my

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize Id cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend
Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand

Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace

And if Im dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you cant sleep at night 
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And youre cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didnt see?

All along there was some

Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didnt see?
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And its cool
Baby, with me
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time

Cross your heart, wont tell no other

Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And Ive been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you wont have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other

Pack your dolls and a sweater
Well move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs

Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least Im trying</span></div></div>

I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you, and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you</span></div></div>

Ive been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Cant not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, well be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
Im on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked 
I thought of you 
In the cracks of light 
I dreamed of you 
It was real enough 
To get me through 
I swear 
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldnt be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldnt be for evermore
Evermore</span></div></div>

Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, hes older than us
Hes in the club doin I dont know what
Youre so cool, it makes me hate you so much
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
Youve ruined my life by not being mine
Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face
Cause look at your face 
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
Youre gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That Im talking to everyone here but you 
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room 
If youve got a girlfriend, Im jealous of her
But if youre single thats honestly worse
Cause youre so gorgeous it actually hurts 
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
Youre so gorgeous

I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I cant face reinvention
I havent met the new me yet
Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That wouldve loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope shell be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didnt mean that
Sorry, I cant see facts through all of my fury
You havent met the new me yet
Therell be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness
I cant make it go away by making you a villain
I guess its the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
Honey, when Im above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You havent met the new me yet
And I think shell give you that
Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Estes a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Estes been losin sleep
Her husbands actin different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, That aint my Merlot on his mouth
That aint my jewelry on our joint account
No, there aint no doubt
I think Im gonna call him out
She says, I think he did it, but I just cant prove it
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
Este wasnt there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Estes bed and everything
No, there aint no doubt
Somebodys gotta catch him out, cause
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it 
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it 
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it
No, no body, no crime

No, no
He did it
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And Ive cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Estes sisters gonna swear she was with me
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it, but they just cant prove it
They think she did it, but they just cant prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just cant prove it
No, no body, no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime

Id meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I dont, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
Hes in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants whats only yours
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
Hes gonna burn this house to the ground
Hows one to know?
Id live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what well become
And drink my husbands wine
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
And Im covered in you
So yeah, its a fire
Its a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, its a war
Its the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows

I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

And a circus aint a love story

Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys

And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me bout your past, thinking your future was me
And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well</span></div></div>

And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Did you think wed be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So dont think its in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this wont
So if youre coming my way
Just dont
Oh, its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
’Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
’Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Band-aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you

And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist

The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if its okay with you, its okay with me

​Tis the damn season, write this down

We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
Sleep in half the day just for old times sake
I wont ask you to wait if you dont ask me to stay
So Ill go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Wholl write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles Im fakin
And the heart I know Im breakin is my own
To leave the warmest bed Ive ever known
We could call it even

Ive been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
Its brighter now, now

I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Ive been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
And I can still see it all 
All of you, all of me 
I once believed love would be 
But its golden 
And I can still see it all 
Back and forth from New York 
I once believed love would be 
But its golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things Im afraid of, Im afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
’Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say, I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I can’t pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you so much, but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright, its just a thousand cuts
I get drunk, but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No, its not
Its death by a thousand cuts 
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes

Whats a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue

Will you forgive my soul
When youre too wise to trust me and too old to care?
Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
Im on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?

Skippin, skip-skippin when Im gone
Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, its so simple
Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, whos counting?
I did a number on you

Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So whyd you have to rain on my parade?
Im shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we cant have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But Im not the only friend youve lost lately 
If only you werent so shady
This is why we cant have nice things, darling

This is why we cant have nice things , honey

They dont care about the he-said, she-said
And heres to my baby
He aint reading what they call me lately
And heres to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I cant even say it with a straight face

Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me</span></div></div>

It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat?
I walked out, I said, Im setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
I remember
Oh, I remember
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? 
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? 
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you dont have to lose it
Shes still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And youre sitting in front of me
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
Help, Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, What a sad sight

Kids and Christmas, but Im unaware
Cause Im right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I cant bear witness
And its been so long

Im right where

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
Whatever you say, it is not right.
Whatever you do, it is not enough.
Your kindness is fake.
Your pain is manipulative.
When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.
When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice
And even louder:
without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.</span></div></div>

Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
Its time, oh-oh
I dont know about you, but Im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me, but Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like were 22 
22 
22, 22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We wont be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah
I dont know about you, but Im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me, but Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights

Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didnt they tell us dont rush into things?
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me?
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didnt it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever 
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better 
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh
Didnt they tell us dont rush into things?
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me?
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didnt it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
But darlin
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever 
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better 
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
Whoa, in Wonderland
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever 
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it 
And life was never worse but never better
Never better 
We found Wonderland

Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, Look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence , silence , you
You can feel it on the way home , way home , you
You can see it with the lights out , lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says Youre my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
You can hear it in the silence , silence , you
You can feel it on the way home , way home , you
You can see it with the lights out , lights out 
You are in love, true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why Ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words
Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence , silence , you
You can feel it on the way home , way home , you

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new

Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you

Been losing grip, on sinking ships

I fell to my knees

Counting my footsteps

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known
Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone

Youre my, my, my, my lover
We could light a bunch of candles

The girl in my story has always been you
Id go down with the Titanic, its true, for you, lover

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, I need you
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

For all that weve been through
