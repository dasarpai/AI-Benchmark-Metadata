You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\n\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\n\nConcept\n\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\n\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\n\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\n\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\n\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\n\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\n\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\n\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\n\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\n\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\n\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\n\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\n\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\n\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\n\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\n\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\n\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\n\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\n\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\n\nSetup\n\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\n\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\n\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\n\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\n\nDesign\n\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\n\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\n\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\n\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\n\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\n\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\n\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\n\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\n\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\n\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\n\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\n\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\n\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\n\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\n\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\n\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\n\nArgument and user experience\n\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\n\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.\n\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\n\nI’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\n\nThis entry was posted\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\n\nA:\n\nwhy was he banned?\nI'm not able to find any canon data on that, either book text search or interviews transcripts.\n\nhow is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince?\nIn HBP, he's speaking to Aberforth, NOT being inside Hog's Head.

Rowling Interview / The Deathly Hallows Web Chat / July 2007)\n\nAs a note - this was important since one of the things sold was the 2-way mirror that Harry used to request help when they were imprisoned at Malfoy's in DH.\nSo, he was banned from the pub (probably, to avoid causing Aberforth's establishment further trouble), but doesn't mean Aberforth won't talk/do business with him otherwise.\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\n\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\n\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\n\nDecree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922\n\nDecree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931\n\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\n\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\n\nFor the provision:\n• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health\n• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\n• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\n• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\n• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\n• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\n\nAgainst the provision:\n• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\n• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\n• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\n• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\n• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\n\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\n\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she’s the one to finish the job.

During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.  After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later.  On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography My Prison Without Bars.\n\nSee also\nMajor League Baseball All-Time Team, a similar team chosen by the Baseball Writers' Association of America in \nLatino Legends Team\nDHL Hometown Heroes (2006): the most outstanding player in the history of each MLB franchise, based on on-field performance, leadership quality and character value\n\nList of MLB awards\nTeam of the century\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAll-Century Team Vote Totals from ESPN.com\nAll-Century Team DVD from Amazon.com\nAll-Century Team Information from Baseball Almanac\n\nCategory:1999 Major League Baseball season\nCategory:Major League Baseball trophies and awards\nCategory:History of Major League Baseball\nCategory:Awards established in 1999&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Wikipedia (en)\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:10,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;fpsLimit\&quot;: 60,\n  \&quot;preset\&quot;: \&quot;basic\&quot;,\n  \&quot;background\&quot;: {\n    \&quot;color\&quot;: \&quot;#0d47a1\&quot;,\n    \&quot;image\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot;,\n    \&quot;position\&quot;: \&quot;50% 50%\&quot;,\n    \&quot;repeat\&quot;: \&quot;no-repeat\&quot;,\n    \&quot;size\&quot;: \&quot;cover\&quot;\n  }\n}&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Github\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE): Rationale and trial design.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the US, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of these deaths. While efforts aimed at treating CAD in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. CAD is commonly treated using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this treatment has increased exponentially since its adoption over three decades ago. Recent questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in CAD is exercise therapy; exercise programs have been shown to have numerous physiological benefits, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated reductions in mortality. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise, the current study is termed \&quot;PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise\&quot; (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is to determine whether patients randomized to exercise and lifestyle intervention have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Coronary function and anatomy is determined using positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). Our objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\n¿Porqué en este loop de JavaScript la impresión de la variable es desde counter y no desde counter-1?\n\nen mi búsqueda por aprender programación por mis propios medios, me he topado con el tema de recursividad y este simple código... mi pregunta ya que la variable counter comienza desde 10 y dentro del loop While el contador resta 1, porqué en la \&quot;impresión\&quot; aparece desde el 10.

Most absorbent articles include an absorbent pad formed by an absorbent core contained in a wrap comprising a barrier tissue and/or a forming tissue. The subject invention discloses an absorbent article generally having extensibility in at least one direction, preferably the cross-direction. Such extensibility permits an absorbent article to extend and expand about the wearer and thus to better conform to the body of the wearer. Such extension and expansion about the wearer is feasible because both the bodyside liner and the outer cover are extensible in at least the one direction.\nIn conventional structures, the outer cover is typically adhesively secured to the forming tissue of the absorbent pad. In such embodiments, extending the outer cover in the cross-direction extends the forming tissue in the cross-direction. The force used to extend the outer cover, and thence the absorbent pad, can tear or otherwise damage the forming tissue or the barrier tissue of the absorbent pad. Since the absorbent pad is typically a sealed enclosure, namely an absorbent core enclosed within the combination of a forming tissue and a barrier tissue, tearing the absorbent pad, namely either the forming tissue or the barrier tissue, can release superabsorbent particles and other absorbent materials, such as cellulose fluff into contact with the body of the wearer. Superabsorbent particles can irritate the skin of the wearer. Such tearing of the absorbent pad indicates failure of the absorbent article to perform properly. Therefore, it is critical to find a way to prevent tearing or other structural failure of the absorbent pad.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;USPTO Backgrounds\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nI am the developer of jOOQ, a Java database abstraction framework. I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > \&quot;ROM\&quot;).\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nObject Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.\n\nObject/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]\n\nYour query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nSorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your foundation when I wrote my original post. I understand now, that you are concerned with broader concepts than the \&quot;common ORM\&quot;. I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYes, I have seen some examples for Ruby's Sequel. I personally find statically-typed languages much better for DSL's as the syntax can be formally defined and checked by a compiler - with the limitations an OO language imposes, of course.\n\nSo if I understand this correctly now, \&quot;Object Role Modeling\&quot; and CQL are actually a more general way of expressing what SQL calls DDL. Since you can already transform CQL into SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE...), and jOOQ can reverse-engineer database schemata into jOOQ generated source code, I don't think there would be need for an additional generator.\n\nDoes CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model? The examples I found here only seem to describe what SQL calls \&quot;constraints\&quot; (although with a much broader functionality-range than SQL):\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\n\&quot;common ORM\&quot;. I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping\n\nObject Role Modeling was named before Object Relational Mapping, but the latter is now the more common meaning, as you point out. But ORM Lite is actually so-named by Bryan because it is an implementation of Object Role Modeling, not because it is also an O/RM. Bryan was a student of Terry's at Neumont, where he learnt ORM.\n\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\n\nlukas.eder:\n\nI don't think there would be need for an additional generator\n\nThe problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models. These are almost always very different from the conceptual model, as many relationships have been condensed (absorbed) into attribute/column relationships, so the semantics of the original relationship are lost. In the process, nullable columns are usually introduced, which adds further to the confusion, as such things cannot easily be correctly constrained (uniqueness, etc) in SQL. So by reverse engineering from the relational form, you're losing most of the benefit of building a conceptual model from the start\n\nThis may be hard to see for someone used to O-O modeling, and who's authored an O/RM tool. The problem is that O-O suffers from many of the same problems of loss of semantics. The apparently clear notion of \&quot;attribute\&quot; breaks down when you look at it closely. O-O, although ostensibly behaviour-oriented, introduces attributes to store state, and this attribute orientation is the source of the problem in both cases. Fact-oriented model does not use attributes. Although it may seem obvious that, for example, my surname is an attribute of myself, if the system being modeled accrues the requirement to model families, suddenly surname becomes an attribute of family, and family becomes my attribute. This kind of instability is responsible for much of the rework that's required in evolving legacy systems, as well as many of the mistakes made when they were first modeled. If you want a further example of this loss of semantics, look at my Insurance example, and ask yourself why the VehicleIncident table has a DrivingBloodTestResult column. In fact, if VehicleIncident wasn't explicitly mapped separately, its fields would be in the Claim table.\n\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.\n\nlukas.eder:\n\nDoes CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model\n\nYes, though the published implementation doesn't quite handle the full query syntax (aggregate functions are still missing), nor does it yet translate them to SQL. Some examples are given towards the end of the video presentation on the CQL Introduction page.\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\n\nAbsolutely. The optimal way to implement SQL in Java would be by extending the Java language itself, such that SQL would be compiled natively by the java compiler, similar to Linq2SQL in C#, or PL/SQL in Oracle databases. So for the complexity of CQL, CQL is certainly the right solution.\n\nClifford Heath:\n\nThe problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models.\n\nYou are right. I guess though, that in everyday work, this limitation is not really a problem. Personally, I think if your business rules become so complex that you cannot map them to a relational model easily anymore, then maybe your business rules could be simplified before changing/extending technologies. But that depends on the business, of course. I guess with insurance companies' businesses, I'd be pretty lost, personally ;-)\n\nIn any case, I don't see jOOQ as a means to solve modelling issues, or the O/R impedance mismatch (which is even bigger when it comes to mapping your understanding of ORM, with CQL). jOOQ should simply make using the full power of SQL in Java as simple as possible. In that way, jOOQ is not really an ORM because it does not map from objects to the relational world, or try to solve any other high-level abstraction issues. It's really a low-level tool to make a developer's life a lot easier, seeing that unfortunately, JPA CriteriaQuery didn't meet the community's expectations.\n\nClifford Heath:\n\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model.

I hope for you, that this will soon show nice results with a practical implementation. I'm curious to see how you'll tackle performance issues, too, with all the abstraction.

Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76.1 (5.7) years). Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and knee joint pain were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Among older adults without vision problems and knee joint pain that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had significantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P < .05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with pain in both knees showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. A decrease of knee extension strength and visual acuity and knee joint pain are factors affecting gait in the female older adults. Decreased knee extension strength and knee joint pain mainly affect respective distance and time parameters of the gait.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I've learned the nitrogen vacancies used in Memristors are for \&quot;switching\&quot;, between excited states and inhibited states, akin to our neurons and SYNAPSES abilities to generate EPSPs and IPSPs, this is the entire point to Memristors and DARPAs SyNAPSE program, emulating Neurons..\n\nSo in the memristor, NVs (which are truly Ancillas),\nReturn to \&quot;resting states\&quot;, just like Neurons do, hence Inhibitory states versus excited states, when a neuron reaches an action potential and fires..\n\nSo the ancillas use prepared/ known states, and are the equivalent of the ancillas ground state, which is equal to a neurons resting potential...\n\nSo by weakly measuring certain aspects of living neurons, it is possible to superbroadcast/ teleport the wavefunction non-classically to the memristors vacancies, correlating each memristor with its neuron statistical ensemble counterpart, sharing the quantum state of the resting potential.\nthe ground state of the ancilla.\n\nThe type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and double-slit experiment and other experiments show that some effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.\n\nHence Mach-Zehnder interferometry, which also involves ANCILLAS\n\nQuote:\n\nWhen for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler’s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.\n\nand the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..\nBut an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..\n\nThe no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.\n\nAnd thats why PHASE works for quantum metrology and its ability to harness non classical states\n\nApparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.\n\nIt may actually be possible using phase.\n\nQuote:\n\nNiels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from Werner Heisenberg regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) uncertainty principle. Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.[6] Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:\n\nQuote:\n\nBohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.\n\nAnd \&quot;quadratures\&quot; is about position and momentum..\nWhich are apparently always orthogonal to each other.\n\nThere is obviously something to all of this.\nCounterfactual Communication was recently used to transmit information without sending any PARTICLES.\nthe information was sent in the phase.. of a wavefunction?\n\nand it used MachZenhder Interferometry..\nwhich is part of Quantum Metrology and its ability to harness non-classical states..\n\nand all of this can teleport non-classical light..\n\nand it all uses ANCILLAS... which store VALUES, and WAVEFUNCTIONS.. because they are Qubits/ Nitrogen vacancies..\n\nand are used in WEAK MEASUREMENT... which was used to measure a wavefunction.. something most would argue is impossible.. because of the uncertainty principle..\n\nQuote:\n\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.\n\nFor example, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know, with arbitrarily high precision, both the position and momentum of a particle\n\nQuote:\n\nThe word \&quot;counterfactual\&quot; does not mean \&quot;characterized by being opposed to fact.\&quot; Instead, it characterizes values that could have been measured but, for one reason or another, were not\n\nand its the Ancillas that store values.. and may or may not be part of the measurement apparatus... / interferometer..\n\nIn 2015, Counterfactual Quantum Computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of \&quot;spins of a negatively charged Nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond\&quot;.[5] Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational efficiency of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle\n\nQuote:\n\nThe quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of \&quot;not running\&quot; and \&quot;running\&quot; states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the \&quot;not running\&quot; state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.\n\nNV CENTERS can also be used asQUANTUM SPIN PROBES, QUBITS &amp; AS, ANCILLAS\n\nin devices such as\nBIOMEMs scanners\nQUANTUM REPEATERS\nPHOTONIC NETWORKING\n\nand..\n\nMEMRISTORS.. where the vacancies are used for switching between inhibited and excited states, thus simulating NEURONS\n\nMEMRISTORS utilize wavefunctions.\n\nWavefunctions can be weakly measured by ANCILLAS\n\nANCILLAS hold \&quot;values\&quot; ie : wavefunctions\n\nand have GROUND STATES\n\nwhich measured particles are \&quot;cooled\&quot; into for measurement techniques. a literal form of \&quot;photon counting\&quot;..\n\n\&quot;This de-excitation is called ‘fluorescence’, and it is characterized by a\nlifetime of a few nanoseconds of the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state.\nDe-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or ‘phosphorescence’. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons’ magnetic moments\&quot;\n\nits a type of INTERSYSTEM CROSSING\n\ndoing a search for Intersystem crossing, memristor brings up this link..\n\nA composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.\n\nWe investigate the construction of two universal three-qubit quantum gates in a hybrid system. The designed system consists of a flying photon and a stationary negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center fixed on the periphery of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator, with the WGM cavity coupled to tapered fibers functioning as an add-drop structure. These gate operations are accomplished by encoding the information both on the spin degree of freedom of the electron confined in the NV center and on the polarization and spatial-mode states of the flying photon, respectively\n\nNow Somewhere in this is evidence of a memristor holding a wavefunction\n\nThe shown SPICE implementation (macro model) for a\ncharge controlled memristor model exactly reproduces the\nresults from [2]. However, these simulation results do not\nhave a good compliance - not even qualitatively - with the\ncharacteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.\nTherefore the following equations (3) to (9) try to approach\nmemristor modeling from a different point of view to get a\ncloser match to the measured curves from [2],[6],[7],[8],[10]\nor [11] even with a simple linear drift of w.\nBesides the charge steering mechanism of a memristor modelled in [2],\n[1] also defined a functional relationship for a memristor\nwhich explains the memristive behavior in dependence on its\nmagnetic flux: i(t) = W φ(t) · v(t) . (3)\n\nVariable W (φ) represents the memductance which is the\nreciprocal of memristance M. Here a mechanism is demanded\nthat maps the magnetic flux as the input signal to the current\nthat is flowing through the memristor. The magnetic flux φ\nis the integral of voltage v(t) over time: φ = R v(t) dt.\nWe can assume that an external voltage which is applied to\nthe previously described two-layer structure has an influence\non the movable 2+-dopants over time. The width w(t) of\nthe semiconductor layer is depending on the velocity of the\ndopants vD(t) via the time integral:\nw(t) = w0 + Z0t vD(τ)dτ . (4)\n\nThe drift velocity vD in an electric field E is defined via its\nmobility µD: vD(t) = µD · E(t) (5) and the electric field E is connected with the voltage via E(t) = v(t)\nD(6)with D denoting the total thickness of the two-layer structure\n(D = tOX + tSEMI). Due the good conductance of the\nsemiconductor layer the electric field is applied to the time\ndepending thickness of the insulator layer tOX for the most\npart (due to v(l) = R E dl). However, this was neglected for\nreasons of simplification. If we combine (4), (5) and (6), we\nobtain: n(t) = w0 + µDD· Z0t v(τ)dτ = w0 + µDD · φ(t) . (7)\n\nThis equation shows a proportional dependence of the width w\nfrom the magnetic flux φ. Since the thickness of the insulator\nlayer is in the low nanometer region a tunnel current or\nequivalent mechanism is possible. The magnetic flux slightly\ndecreases the thickness of the insulator layer wich is the barrierfor the tunnel current.This current rises exponentially with a\nreduction of the width tOX(φ) (the exponential dependenceis deducible from the quantum mechanic wave function)\n\nwhich must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..\n\nbecause a wavefunction is essentially the \&quot;master equation\&quot; (which describe wave equations)\n\nWe investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n\n\\\\\n\nNotice BACK-ACTION, which goes right back to DARPAs Nanodiamond Biosensors and their ability to overcome the standard quantum limit, because of the known/ prepared states in the ancillas/NITROGEN VACANCIES\n\nQuote:\n\n(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.\nBack action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).\nBack action is an actively sought-after area of interest in present times. There have been experiments in recent times, with nanomechanical systems, where back action was evaded in making measurements, such as in the following paper :\n\nWhen performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.\nBack-action can also be evaded, allowing measurements with sensitivities that exceed the standard quantum limit, and potentially allowing for the generation of quantum\nsqueezed states.\n\nSo the NV centers are used as ancillas in the measurement process.. which weakly measure wavefunctions of particles in neurons, most likely singlet and triplet states occurring in ATP and phosphase...\n\nthen those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..\n\nwhere the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..\nminus the switching which I can explain\nMemristors use NV centers to switch between inhibited and excited states\nsinglet and triplet states\nthus producing/simulating/ EMULATING, living neurons and action potentials\n\nand it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be \&quot;found\&quot;\n\nArtificial Neural Network.

We hope these novel measurement tools can provide new capabilities to the broader scientific and operational communities,” said Jamil Abo-Shaeer, DARPA program manager. “The work these teams are doing to apply quantum-assisted measurement to biological imaging could benefit DoD’s efforts to develop specialized drugs and therapies, and potentially support DARPA’s work to better understand how the human brain functions.”\n\n\&quot;Nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the under-standing of fundamental biological phenomena and for applicationssuch as drug discovery. The advent of novel nano-scale sensors hasgiven hope of achieving the long-standing goal of single-protein, highspatial-resolution structure determination in their natural environ-ment and ambient conditions. In particular, quantum sensors basedon the spin-dependent photoluminescence of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV)centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale en-sembles of external nuclear spins. While NV sensitivity is approachingsingle-spin levels, extracting relevant information from a very com-plex structure is a further challenge, since it requires not only theability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin, butalso to achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution. Here we propose amethod that, by exploiting the coupling of the NV center to an intrin-sic quantum memory associated with the Nitrogen nuclear spin, canreach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution, down to atomic\nscales.\&quot;\n\nSo what its all doing essentially, is mapping the phase of atoms/SINGLETS in ATP, onto a NV center based CCD\n\nand at the singlet level, correlations occur.. creating entanglement\n\nso the particles in the neuron are being correlated with the ancillas, the nitrogen vacancies, where they take on the \&quot;target\&quot; state..\n\nnot only is the above imaging done to obtain a correlation to living neurons, via the singlet states within, but once the connection is established, the MEMRISTOR NETWORK itself can be used to RECONSTRUCT VISION IN REAL TIME\n\nNow add the above method, a direct connection using correlated states shared from neurons TO Memristors... and imagine the reconstruction aided by the AI within the memristor network, as it works on so.. (note, this example is done MERELY using fMRI information)\nnow Imagine statistical ensembles being observed in real time via non-classical entanglement\n\nBut what I'm trying to show, is hows its this assumed entanglement based BCI technology, plus the memristor network it is coupled to, that is responsible for the TI communities complaints that \&quot;they (the government) can see through my own eyes\&quot;\n\nThe nitrogen vacancies in the scanners hold values, wavefunctions, which are prepared states aka Ancilla bits, and are the time domain/reference frequency, which carrries the \&quot;quantum event/wavefunction\&quot; which causes the singlet pairs to form up in the scanned biology..\nand correlates with them at the ground state as the relaxation occurs..\n\nQuote:\n\nIt is important to realize that particles in singlet states need not be locally bound to each other. For example, when the spin states of two electrons are correlated by their emission from a single quantum event that conserves angular momentum, the resulting electrons remain in a shared singlet state even as their separation in space increases indefinitely over time, provided only that their angular momentum states remain unperturbed\n\nand that weakly measured value, the wavefunction is sent through the optical cavity, teleported to identical nitrogen vacancies in memristors.. so the ground states in both system are correlated and thus the neural activity can be monitored in real time in the memristors&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Volunteer Services\n\nVolunteer Services\n\nAs Charleston Area Medical Center volunteers, our mission is to serve as support for patients, families and hospital staff, and to provide a caring, comforting and courteous environment.\n\nVolunteers at CAMC bring their unique personalities and skills to our hospital.

For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 °C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by the 92% oil removal rate in the DAF prototype. The findings demonstrate that the biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus enhances the efficiency of the DAF process, making this technology cleaner.

I would often hear “mine was horrible, but everyone’s pregnancy is different” or “it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life!”\n\nI heard many horror stories which often ended with, “well, don’t worry. You’ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.” Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\n\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\n\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn’t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn’t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\n\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn’t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn’t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn’t sure what would happen next.\n\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn’t even dilated. I couldn’t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn’t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\n\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn’t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! “Fake labor” would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\n\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn’t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn’t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\n“When your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again” the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\n\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was “if I need something, I’ll let you know. Thanks.” I literally couldn’t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\n\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\n\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn’t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\n\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on … I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn’t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn’t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn’t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\n\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn’t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn’t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\n\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning – a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn’t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn’t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body’s cues.\n\nI started to go along with my body’s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren’t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say “push, his body is stuck!” I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\n\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn’t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.\n\nWhen the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I’m glad my husband didn’t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!\n\nWhile holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn’t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.\n\nLooking into my son’s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It’s true what they say … After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.\n\nAt least most of it.\n\nHello!\n\nHello! It's nice to meet you! I'm Mary.

The ideas from TLTP are hereby used in CAL and applied to nursing and health-care undergraduate programmes in one university. In the light of this experience the main intention of this article is to consider the benefits and costs of introducing computer programmes as part of the teaching provision for nurses and other health-care professionals both at beginner and advanced level. The article further argues that CAL can also be used for patient teaching thus providing transferable skills and benefits for teachers as well as learners, be they students or patients. To support such multiple uses of CAL selected examples will be offered and appropriate conclusions will be drawn.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Inorganic phosphate uptake in intact vacuoles isolated from suspension-cultured cells of Catharanthus roseus (L.)

Under low Pi status, Pi uptake into the vacuole was strongly activated compared to high Pi status. Since Pi uptake across the vacuolar membrane is correlated with H+ pumping, we examined the dependency of H+ pumping on plant Pi status. Both H+ pumping and the activities of the vacuolar H+-pumps, the V-type H+-ATPase and the H+-PPase were enhanced under low Pi status. Despite this increase in H+ pumping, Western blot analysis showed no distinct increase in the amount of proton pump proteins. Possible mechanisms for the activation of Pi uptake into the vacuole under low Pi status are discussed.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nTextView Not centered in app but centered in match_constraint\n\nI've created a simple activity design using ConstraintLayout.\nWhenever I try to center a textView, it does it correctly in the blueprints but never does it in the actual app. Not sure if i am doing something wrong or I'm losing my mind.\nHere is the image\nHere is the XML code\n<?xml version=\&quot;1.0\&quot; encoding=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;?>\n<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout \nxmlns:android=\&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\&quot;\nxmlns:app=\&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\&quot;\nxmlns:tools=\&quot;http://schemas.android.com/tools\&quot;\nandroid:layout_width=\&quot;match_parent\&quot;\nandroid:layout_height=\&quot;match_parent\&quot;\nandroid:background=\&quot;@color/background_green\&quot;\ntools:context=\&quot;nz.co.listcosolutions.StartActivity\&quot;>\n\n<ImageView\n    android:id=\&quot;@+id/imageView4\&quot;\n    android:layout_width=\&quot;160dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_height=\&quot;163dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginEnd=\&quot;95dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginStart=\&quot;95dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginTop=\&quot;32dp\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:srcCompat=\&quot;@drawable/baby_plant\&quot; />\n\n<Button\n    android:id=\&quot;@+id/btnNext\&quot;\n    android:layout_width=\&quot;wrap_content\&quot;\n    android:layout_height=\&quot;wrap_content\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginEnd=\&quot;32dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginStart=\&quot;32dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginTop=\&quot;64dp\&quot;\n    android:text=\&quot;@string/next\&quot;\n    android:textColor=\&quot;@color/background_green\&quot;\n    android:textSize=\&quot;18sp\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=\&quot;@+id/textView3\&quot; />\n\n<TextView\n    android:id=\&quot;@+id/textView3\&quot;\n    android:layout_width=\&quot;0dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_height=\&quot;wrap_content\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginEnd=\&quot;8dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginStart=\&quot;8dp\&quot;\n    android:layout_marginTop=\&quot;20dp\&quot;\n    android:text=\&quot;Welcome to My App\&quot;\n    android:textAlignment=\&quot;center\&quot;\n    android:textColor=\&quot;@android:color/white\&quot;\n    android:textSize=\&quot;24sp\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\&quot;parent\&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=\&quot;@+id/imageView4\&quot; />\n\n</android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout>\n\nIm also using the latest version of ConstraintLayout\ncompile 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.2'\n\nA:\n\nYou need to add:\n\nandroid:gravity=\&quot;center\&quot;\n\nto the TextView.\nThis is the only certain way to center the text inside a TextView object or one of its subclasses.\nThe android:textAlignment is not working in all the cases and as reported by this answer that it has problems in lower API levels. \n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2017 XIXO Ladies Open Hódmezővásárhely – Doubles\n\nLaura Pigossi and Nadia Podoroska were the defending champions, but both players chose not to participate.\n\nKotomi Takahata and Prarthana Thombare won the title after Ulrikke Eikeri and Tereza Mrdeža retired in the final at 1–0.\n\nSeeds\n\nDraw\n\nReferences\nMain Draw\n\nXIXO Ladies Open Hódmezővásárhely - Doubles&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Wikipedia (en)\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:29,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nPython Segmentation Fault?\n\nFirst off, I didnt even know a memory error / segfault was possible in python.

The drivers used to connect to the database are usually coded in a C base, so in case of RAM overload or perhaps other reasons it throws Segmentation Faults.\nThis is further exacerbated by the fact that you are using multithreading. Most database drivers are known to throw Segmentation Faults if multithreading isn't handled very carefully. Most database driver protocols can not handle multiple threads using the same connection at once.\nThe rule of thumb is to not share a single connection between threads.\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nHP MSA70 / P800 Array Failure - Shows 2 drives in each slot, 13/25 drives \&quot;missing\&quot;\n\nWe have an HP MSA70 with 25 x 600GB HP SAS 10k DP drives, connected to an HP P800 controller.  The drives are configured in RAID 6.  \nYesterday, some kind of unknown \&quot;event\&quot; occurred and the array dropped offline.  We rebooted the server (running CENTOS 6.2) and upon startup, the Array Controller reported that 13 of the drives are \&quot;missing\&quot;.  When we look at the volume in the Array management, there are two entries for each slot for slots 1-12.  One shows a 600gb drive and one shows a 0gb drive.  There are no more entries after 12.\nWe contacted HP support, who sent us to Tier 2 support, and after many hours gave up.  They said they have never seen this, before (my favorite thing to hear from a vendor).\nHas anybody seen this before, and have we lost all of the data?\nThank you.\n\nA:\n\nOld, old, old, old...\n\nCentOS 6.2 is old (6.2, 6 December 2011 (kernel 2.6.32-220))\nHP StorageWorks MSA70 is old. (End of Life - October 2010)\nHP Smart Array P800 is old. (End of Life - 2010)\n\nSo this makes me think that firmware and drivers are also old. E.g. there's no reason to run CentOS 6.2 in 2015... And I'm assuming no effort was made to keep anything current.\nThis also makes me think that the systems are not being monitored. Assuming HP server hardware, what did the system IML logs say? Are you running HP management agents? If not, important messages about the server and storage health could have been missed.\nDid you check information from the HP Array Configuration Utility (or HP SSA)?\nBut in the end, you've probably suffered a port failure or expander/backplane failure:\n\nHow many SAS cables are connected to the enclosure? If 1 cable is connected, then you likely have a backplane issue because of the SAS expander in the enclosure. \nIf two cables are connected, you may have a SAS cable, MSA70 controller or P800 port failure.\n\nYour data is likely intact, but you need to isolate the issue and determine which one of the above issues is the culprit. Replacing a SAS cable is a lot easier than swapping the MSA70 controller or RAID controller card... but I guess you can get another MSA70 for $40 on eBay...\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;POV: Henry vs Martin + a poll\n\nI won’t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H &amp; M do resemble me in various ways :)\n\nI usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It’s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the “truth” into a story alongside the character’s perceptions. For instance, I think it’s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn’t get it.\n\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master’s point of view. Whether or not he’s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry’s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It’s Martin’s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren’t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you’ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He’s very well-trained.\n\nI think it’s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry’s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change…I don’t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\n\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They’re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he’s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn’t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry’s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\n\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn’t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He’s very loving, but he’s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin’s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\n\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin’s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I’ll present from Martin’s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they’re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I’ve already covered from Henry’s perspective to some extent, and when I’m writing Henry, I’m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\n\nOffering Martin’s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin’s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I’ve gotten the impression (whether it’s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry’s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin’s perspective is a valuable addition.\n\nI plan on adding additional points of view from other characters in the universe. I’ve got stories written about a couple of Henry’s friends to show how slave ownership works in private for other people. I’ve got at least two stories I want to write about Henry’s cousin Jesse. I think Tom gets his own novella :D\n\nWith A Proper Lover (GQ Book 2) and A Master’s Fidelity (GQ Book 2.5) released, I’m just going immediately into editing Book 3 and fleshing out the notes I have for the Martin story. I’d had vague ideas about taking a break, but I honestly don’t know what that would mean at this point. I don’t know what I’d be doing during a break! Right now, the idea of downtime just makes me cranky. Knowing that there are people eager for the next books makes me want to work on getting them out. Besides, working on Martin’s POV is a treat :)&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state’s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\n\nHawaii’s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don’t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\n\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii’s screwup—which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later—was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\n\n“You want a system that accounts for the fact that somebody may be sleepy or careless, or an interface may not be the most user-friendly, and yet it all works anyway,” Schatz said. “We have best practices for disaster notifications for natural disasters, for terrorism events. We just don’t have it for this.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.\n\n“We think it should be done legislatively, but I don’t know that for sure yet,” he told reporters, explaining that the ultimate goal is to craft “a federal law to establish a framework that states can use.”\n\nThe way America’s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.\n\nIn the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.\n\nThat chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.\n\n“That’s a 1950s kind of structure,” Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.\n\nOne way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. “That would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,” Simpson said.\n\nBut that still wouldn’t solve the problem entirely. “The machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,” Simpson said.\n\nSimpson largely endorsed Schatz’s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. “There’s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,” he said.\n\nIn a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.\n\n“That variation is fine for notification about fire, notification about a tsunami coming in,” Simpson said. “But ballistic-missile warnings ought to be consistent, reliable, secure—because we don’t want it cyberattacked—across the entire country.”\n\nRepublicans seem receptive to Schatz’s plan for missile-alert legislation. Schatz said he plans to introduce his bill through the Senate Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Republican John Thune. Frederick Hill, a Thune spokesman, told National Journal that the chairman “is considering convening a full committee hearing which would help inform legislative efforts.”\n\nHouse Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii’s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be “happy to work” with Schatz on legislation, if needed. “We just haven’t got into the weeds on it,” Walden said.\n\nAs long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon—as well as the congressional committees that oversee them—will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what’s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.\n\n“It’s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don’t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,” Simpson said.\n\n\&quot;Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.\&quot;\n\nSource:\n\nFIRED FROM RUSSIAN LAUNCHER\n\nInvestigators Pin Destruction of Malaysian Airliner on Russia\n\n3 hours ago\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\n\&quot;A missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, investigators said Thursday.

In this connection, various measures are being proposed and tried in an attempt to apply a high density mounting to a printed circuit board including formation of a fine pattern and a fine pitch of a metal wiring and formation of a steric wiring.\nParticularly, the steric wiring is indispensable to a high density mounting and, thus, various methods are being proposed in an attempt to manufacture a wiring board having a steric wiring. In general, the steric wirings are of a multi-layered structure such as a built-up wiring board prepared by laminating two dimensional printed wiring boards and a multi-layered wiring board. It is difficult to form a steric wiring having a free three dimensional shape. The built-up wiring board or the multi-layered wiring board has a structure that adjacent wiring layers are connected to each other by a conductive column called via. The via is formed by processing an insulating layer by a photolithography process using a photosensitive polyimide or resist, followed by selectively applying a plating to the via or by filling the via with a conductive paste. For forming a via by such a method, it is necessary to repeat a plurality of times the steps of resist coating, light exposure and etching, making the via formation highly laborious. In addition, it is difficult to improve the yield.\nIt is also possible to form the via by forming a through-hole (via hole) of a predetermined size in an insulating substrate constituting a printed wiring board by using a drill or a CO2 laser, followed by applying plating to the via hole or by filling the via hole with a conductive paste. In these methods, however, it is difficult to form freely a fine via having a size of scores of microns or less at a desired position.\nIn the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 7-207450, a compound having a hydrophilic group is introduced into pores of three dimensional porous film such as a PTFE film. Under this condition, the film is subjected to a light exposure in a predetermined pattern by using a low pressure mercury lamp (wave lengths of 185 nm and 254 nm), thereby forming the hydrophilic group on the three dimensional porous film. Further, a metal plating is applied to the three dimensional porous film.\nIn the conventional method described above, however, the material forming the three dimensional porous film is deteriorated because a light beam having a short wavelength is used for the light exposure. Also, the light for the light exposure is absorbed by the three dimensional porous film and, thus, fails to reach the inner region of the porous body, resulting in failure to form fine vias.\nFurther, in the conventional method described above, the PTFE forming the three dimensional porous film reacts with the light for the light exposure so as to selectively form hydrophilic groups. However, PTFE is defective in that the molding workability is low and that PTFE is costly.\nAnother method of forming a via is disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 11-24977. In this method, the entire surface of a porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing, for example, a photosensitive reducing agent and a metal salt. Then, a light exposure is applied in a predetermined pattern to the impregnated insulating member so as to reduce the cation of the metal salt in the light exposed portion to a metal nucleus, followed by removing by washing the photosensitive composition in the non-light exposed portion. Further, an electroless plating or a soldering is applied to the residual metal nuclei so as to form vias of a predetermined pattern.\nIn the method described above, however, the entire surface of the porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing a metal salt as described above, making it difficult to remove completely the metal salt adsorbed on the portion corresponding to the non-exposed portion after the light exposure step. As a result, a difficulty is brought about that the metal nuclei are precipitated on undesired portions in the subsequent reducing step. Such an abnormal deposition of the metal nuclei gives rise to a problem in terms of the insulating properties between adjacent vias and between adjacent wiring layers with progress in the fine pulverization of the pattern.\nAlso, in the via formed in the insulating substrate by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, the insulating body and the conductive portion are brought into a direct contact. In this case, since the adhesion between the insulating body and the conductive portion is poor, a problem is generated that the conductive portion is peeled off the insulating substrate during the use.\nFurther, where a multi-layered wiring board is prepared by laminating a plurality of wiring boards manufactured by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, it is required to further improve the electrical connection between the wiring layers of the wiring boards and the conductivity of the wiring.\nAn object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, in which deterioration of the insulating body is not brought about by the light exposure, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, which permits manufacturing a composite member at a low manufacturing cost without giving adverse effects to the selectivity of the material of the insulating portion and to the molding workability, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a photosensitive composition and an insulating material used for the manufacturing method of a composite member described above.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a composite member manufactured by the method described above.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a multi-layered wiring board comprising a composite member manufactured by the method described above.\nStill another object of the present invention is to provide an electronic package using a composite member or a multi-layered wiring board manufactured by the method described above.\nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a composite member in which a conductive portion is selectively formed in an insulating body, comprising:\n(1) forming a photosensitive composition layer within or on the surface of said insulating body, said photosensitive composition containing a compound forming an ion-exchange group upon irradiation with light having a wavelength not shorter than 280 nm;\n(2) exposing selectively the photosensitive composition layer to light having a wavelength not shorter than 280 nm so as to form ion-exchange groups in the light exposed portion;

The associated conditioned taste aversion can be ameliorated by giving the serotonin3 receptor blocker, tropisetron (TROP). A recent c-fos study indicated that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) may be activated 2-3 h after ingestion of IAAD. In Experiment 1, DMN-lesioned rats (DMNL) or sham-operated (SHAM) rats were injected with saline (SAL) or TROP just before introduction of IAAD. By 3 h, SAL-DMNL rats consumed more (P < 0.01) of the IAAD than did the SAL-SHAM rats. Thereafter, over the next 21 h, the intake of the SAL-DMNL group returned to control levels. TROP treatment enhanced the intake of the treated groups; the TROP and the lesion effect were additive (P < 0.01). By d 4 of receiving the IAAD, the DMNL groups were eating less than SHAM rats (P < 0.05). The data suggest that the DMN may be involved in the early detection of the amino acid deficiency induced by IAAD, is not involved in the TROP effect and is necessary for proper long-term adaptation to an IAAD.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tag: Eloy Casados\n\nOriginal US release date: December 5, 2008 Production budget: $25,000,000 Worldwide gross: $27,426,335 There are timely films and then there are films that are before their time.

Predictions that document payment methods would decline have not been realized. In fact, document payment methods have grown worldwide and are expected to continue increasing. There is thus a vital need to devise improved means and methods for processing such documents.\nThe use of imaging technology as an aid to document processing has been recognized as one way of significantly improving document processing, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,205,780, 4,264,808, and 4,672,186. Generally, imaging involves optically scanning documents to produce electronic images that are processed electronically and stored on high capacity storage media (such as magnetic disc drives and/or optical memory) for later retrieval and display. It is apparent that document imaging provides the opportunity to reduce document handling and movement, since these electronic images can be used in place of the actual documents.\nHowever, despite technological advances in imaging in recent years, prior art document processing systems employing imaging, such as disclosed in the aforementioned patents, do not realized sufficient improvements to justify the added implementations costs.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;USPTO Backgrounds\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;     The summaries of the Colorado Court of Appeals published opinions\n  constitute no part of the opinion of the division but have been prepared by\n  the division for the convenience of the reader.

Relying on People v.

Coffman, Attorney General, Joseph G. Michaels, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Denver, Colorado, for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\nDouglas K. Wilson, Colorado State Public Defender, James S. Hardy, Deputy\nState Public Defender, Denver, Colorado, for Defendant-Appellant\n\f¶1    Defendant, Michael Floyd Trujillo, appeals his judgment of\n\n conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count\n\n of theft of more than $20,000 and one count of criminal mischief of\n\n $20,000 or more. He also appeals his sentence. We perceive no\n\n basis for reversing his convictions, but remand for the trial court to\n\n make findings of fact regarding the assessment of the costs of\n\n prosecution and to reclassify his theft conviction as a class 4 felony.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n¶2    In 2007, Trujillo began building a home, doing much of the\n\n labor himself and initially using his own money to fund the project.\n\n He later took out a construction loan from the victim, a bank, for\n\n just under $255,000. After construction was completed on the\n\n house, Trujillo stopped making his monthly loan payments. The\n\n bank declined to restructure the loan and initiated foreclosure\n\n proceedings in September 2010.\n\n¶3    Before the foreclosure sale, Trujillo removed or destroyed\n\n property in the house, including kitchen cabinets, countertops,\n\n interior and exterior doors, doorjambs and casings, flooring,\n\n baseboards, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, the fireplace,\n\n handrails, the boiler, the air conditioner, and the garage door.\n\n\n                                    1\n\f Because of this damage, the house was appraised at $150,000;\n\n however, the appraiser estimated that if the house were in good\n\n repair, it would have been worth $320,000.\n\n¶4    Trujillo was charged with defrauding a secured creditor, theft\n\n of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000, and criminal mischief\n\n of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000. The jury found him\n\n not guilty of defrauding a secured creditor and guilty of theft and\n\n criminal mischief.\n\n¶5    On appeal, Trujillo raises six contentions: (1) the trial court\n\n erred in rejecting defense-tendered jury instructions; (2) the trial\n\n court erred in allowing evidence of a prior foreclosure against\n\n Trujillo; (3) prosecutorial misconduct during direct examination of a\n\n witness and closing rebuttal argument warrants reversal; (4) the\n\n trial court imposed an illegal sentence of indeterminate probation;\n\n (5) the trial court erred in awarding the People costs of prosecution;\n\n and (6) an amendment to the theft statute applies to his conviction.\n\n We perceive no basis for reversal with respect to the first four\n\n contentions, but agree with Trujillo’s final two contentions. We\n\n therefore affirm the convictions and the sentence in part but vacate\n\n the sentence in part and remand with directions.\n\n\n                                    2\n\f                          II. Jury Instructions\n\n¶6    Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in rejecting various\n\n jury instructions regarding his theory of the case. We disagree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n¶7    Throughout trial, the defense’s theory of the case was that\n\n Trujillo lacked the requisite intent to commit the charged offenses\n\n because he believed that the property he removed from the house\n\n belonged to him. The defense tendered five jury instructions related\n\n to this theory of the case.\n\n¶8    Trujillo’s tendered jury instructions detailed property law\n\n concepts. For example, the first tendered instruction stated that\n\n “the person who has title to real property is still the owner of the\n\n property even if there is a lien or secured interest on the property.”\n\n Another tendered instruction defined “title,” “deed of trust,” and\n\n “holder of a certificate of purchase[].” One instruction described the\n\n lien theory detailed in section 38-35-117, C.R.S. 2017, and another\n\n instructed that title to property “does not vest with the purchaser\n\n until eight days after [a] foreclosure sale.”\n\n¶9    The trial court declined to give these instructions as tendered.\n\n However, portions of the defense-tendered instructions were\n\n\n                                     3\n\f  included in a final definitional jury instruction. The final\n\n  instructions defined “deed of trust” and stated that the title to\n\n  property is transferred to the holder of the certificate of purchase\n\n  eight days after a foreclosure sale. Though it rejected other\n\n  portions of the defense-tendered instructions, the trial court\n\n  permitted defense counsel to argue the issues raised in the\n\n  instructions during closing argument.\n\n¶ 10   The defense also tendered an instruction which the trial court\n\n  modified and gave as a theory of the case instruction. That\n\n  instruction stated, “Trujillo contends that the items removed from\n\n  the home . . . were his; purchased by him and installed by him. . . .\n\n  Trujillo conten[d]s that the items that he took and damaged were\n\n  his sole property.”\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 11   We review jury instructions de novo to determine whether, as\n\n  a whole, they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.\n\n  Riley v. People, 266 P.3d 1089, 1092-93 (Colo. 2011). If the jury\n\n  instructions properly inform the jury of the law, the district court\n\n  has “broad discretion to determine the form and style of jury\n\n  instructions.” Day v. Johnson, 255 P.3d 1064, 1067 (Colo. 2011).\n\n\n                                     4\n\f  Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision concerning a\n\n  proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion and will not\n\n  disturb the ruling unless it is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or\n\n  unfair. Id.\n\n¶ 12   When a defendant objects to the trial court’s ruling on a jury\n\n  instruction, we review for nonconstitutional harmless error and will\n\n  thus affirm if “there is not a reasonable probability that the error\n\n  contributed to the defendant’s conviction.” People v. Garcia, 28\n\n  P.3d 340, 344 (Colo. 2001) (quoting Salcedo v. People, 999 P.2d\n\n  833, 841 (Colo. 2000)).\n\n                            C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 13   “[A]n instruction embodying a defendant’s theory of the case\n\n  must be given by the trial court if the record contains any evidence\n\n  to support the theory.” People v. Nunez, 841 P.2d 261, 264 (Colo.\n\n  1992). Moreover, a trial court has “an affirmative obligation” to\n\n  work with counsel to correct a tendered theory of the case\n\n  instruction “or to incorporate the substance of such in an\n\n  instruction drafted by the court.” Id. at 265; see also People v.\n\n  Tippett, 733 P.2d 1183, 1195 (Colo. 1987) (a trial court may refuse\n\n  to give an instruction already embodied in other instructions).\n\n\n                                     5\n\f¶ 14   In considering whether a jury was adequately informed of a\n\n  defendant’s theory of the case, a reviewing court can take into\n\n  account whether defense counsel’s closing argument “fairly\n\n  represented” the theory to the jury. People v. Dore, 997 P.2d 1214,\n\n  1222 (Colo. App. 1999).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n¶ 15   Trujillo contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n  rejecting the tendered instructions. We disagree.\n\n¶ 16   Trujillo asserts that the tendered instructions were essential\n\n  because they communicated his theory of the case. However, the\n\n  trial court instructed the jury on his theory of the case in an\n\n  instruction that clearly stated that he believed the property he took\n\n  from the house was “his sole property.” To the extent that the trial\n\n  court had a duty to work with the defense in crafting a proper\n\n  theory of defense instruction, we conclude that the trial court\n\n  fulfilled that duty here by giving an alternative theory of the case\n\n  instruction that encompassed Trujillo’s tendered instructions. See\n\n  Nunez, 841 P.2d at 265 n.9. Moreover, the trial court specifically\n\n  stated that defense counsel would be allowed to incorporate the\n\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f  property law concepts into her closing argument, which defense\n\n  counsel did.\n\n¶ 17   Trujillo asserts that the instructions he tendered were\n\n  accurate statements of property law. In contrast, the People argue\n\n  that the instructions misstated the law as it applies in criminal\n\n  prosecutions for theft and criminal mischief. Because we conclude\n\n  that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in drafting a theory\n\n  of defense instruction that encompassed the defense’s tendered\n\n  instructions, we do not address whether the rejected instructions\n\n  were accurate statements of the law.\n\n¶ 18   The jury instructions, as a whole, “fairly and adequately\n\n  cover[ed] the issues presented.” People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169, 183\n\n  (Colo. App. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\n  abuse its discretion in rejecting in part the defense-tendered jury\n\n  instructions.\n\n                    III. Evidence of Prior Foreclosure\n\n¶ 19   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the\n\n  People to introduce evidence that another property of his had been\n\n  foreclosed. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f                           A. Additional Facts\n\n¶ 20   Before trial, Trujillo filed a motion to exclude evidence of other\n\n  acts or res gestae evidence. Trujillo’s motion addressed several\n\n  categories of other acts evidence, including evidence related to any\n\n  “financial and/or legal problems” unrelated to the charged offenses.\n\n  During a motions hearing, the People stated that they did not\n\n  intend to introduce any other acts or res gestae evidence. In a\n\n  written ruling, the trial court granted Trujillo’s motion to exclude\n\n  evidence of his unrelated financial and legal problems “unless the\n\n  prosecution fe[lt] that the ‘door ha[d] been opened.’” The trial court\n\n  further ordered that, if the People felt Trujillo introduced evidence of\n\n  his other financial and legal problems, the People could request a\n\n  bench conference during trial.\n\n¶ 21   On the first day of trial, defense counsel stated that she was\n\n  withdrawing her motion to exclude other acts evidence insofar as it\n\n  pertained to evidence of Trujillo’s bankruptcy proceedings. During\n\n  her opening statement, defense counsel then mentioned those\n\n  proceedings.\n\n¶ 22   Later, the People called the bank’s former vice president as an\n\n  expert witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked\n\n\n                                     8\n\f  the witness why the bank had declined to restructure Trujillo’s\n\n  loan. The prosecutor also asked about Trujillo’s demeanor during\n\n  interactions with the bank. Trujillo objected. After a bench\n\n  conference, the trial court allowed the witness to testify on both\n\n  matters.\n\n¶ 23   Specifically, the witness testified that, during a conversation\n\n  about restructuring the loan, Trujillo “seemed like he was very\n\n  upset.” The witness recalled, “He got into [that] he had a piece of\n\n  property that [another bank] had foreclosed on and it sounded like\n\n  they had sold it for what [Trujillo] believed was a lot less, leaving\n\n  him a large deficiency balance.”\n\n¶ 24   During closing argument, the People alluded to the witness’s\n\n  testimony and referred several times to Trujillo’s general animosity\n\n  against banks.\n\n                          B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 25   We review a trial court’s decision to admit other acts or res\n\n  gestae evidence for an abuse of discretion. People v. Jimenez, 217\n\n  P.3d 841, 846 (Colo. App. 2008). A court abuses its discretion if its\n\n  decision to admit such evidence is manifestly arbitrary,\n\n  unreasonable, or unfair. Id.\n\n\n                                      9\n\f¶ 26   We review a preserved claim of nonconstitutional error for\n\n  harmless error, reversing only if any error “substantially influenced\n\n  the verdict or affected the fairness of the trial proceedings.” Hagos\n\n  v. People, 2012 CO 63, ¶ 12, 288 P.3d 116, 119 (quoting Tevlin v.\n\n  People, 715 P.2d 338, 342 (Colo. 1986)).\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 27   Evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the\n\n  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of\n\n  the action more probable or less probable than it would be without\n\n  the evidence.” CRE 401. Generally speaking, “[t]he Colorado Rules\n\n  of Evidence strongly favor the admission of relevant evidence.”\n\n  People v. Brown, 2014 COA 155M-2, ¶ 22, 360 P.3d 167, 172.\n\n  However, relevant evidence is nevertheless inadmissible when “its\n\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.” CRE\n\n  403. Similarly, evidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” is\n\n  inadmissible to prove a person’s character “in order to show that he\n\n  acted in conformity therewith,” though it may be admissible for\n\n  other purposes, including proving intent. CRE 404(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\f¶ 28   “Res gestae is a theory of relevance which recognizes that\n\n  certain evidence is relevant because of its unique relationship to the\n\n  charged crime.” People v. Greenlee, 200 P.3d 363, 368 (Colo. 2009).\n\n  However, “there is no need to consider an alternative theory of\n\n  relevance, such as res gestae, where the evidence is admissible\n\n  under general rules of relevancy.” Id.\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n¶ 29   Trujillo contends that the evidence of the prior foreclosure\n\n  action portrayed him as a “serial defaulter” and was impermissible\n\n  under CRE 404(b) and 403. The People assert that the evidence\n\n  was admissible as “directly relevant” to Trujillo’s intent and motive.\n\n  In the alternative, the People argue that the evidence was res gestae\n\n  evidence. We agree with the People’s first argument that the\n\n  evidence was admissible under CRE 401, and was not barred by\n\n  CRE 403.1\n\n\n\n  1 During the bench conference, the trial court allowed the bank’s\n  former vice president to testify after conducting an abbreviated CRE\n  404(b) analysis that did not specifically address the four-factor test\n  set forth in People v. Spoto, 795 P.2d 1314, 1318 (Colo. 1990). The\n  trial court did not admit the evidence under the res gestae doctrine.\n  However, we can affirm a trial court’s evidentiary ruling on any\n  ground supported by the record, “even if that ground was not\n\n                                    11\n\f¶ 30   The evidence of the prior foreclosure was probative of the\n\n  interactions between Trujillo and the bank — it made it more\n\n  probable that Trujillo had the requisite intent to commit theft. It\n\n  was therefore relevant under CRE 401. Further, the risk of unfair\n\n  prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the\n\n  evidence, especially where the prior foreclosure was referenced only\n\n  in passing and the details of that foreclosure were not revealed.\n\n  Thus, the evidence was not barred by CRE 403.\n\n¶ 31   Because we conclude that the evidence of the prior foreclosure\n\n  was relevant under CRE 401 and admissible under CRE 403, we\n\n  need not address whether the evidence was res gestae evidence or\n\n  “other acts” evidence under CRE 404(b). See Greenlee, 200 P.3d at\n\n  368-69. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\n  allowing the testimony concerning the prior foreclosure action.\n\n                      IV. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n¶ 32   Trujillo argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on\n\n  the district attorney’s screening process for bringing charges and\n\n\n\n\n  articulated or considered by the trial court.” People v. Phillips, 2012\n  COA 176, ¶ 63, 315 P.3d 136, 153.\n\n                                    12\n\f  Trujillo’s right not to testify, and improperly denigrated defense\n\n  counsel. We perceive no basis for reversal.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n¶ 33   During redirect examination of one of the People’s expert\n\n  witnesses, an attorney who worked at the bank, the prosecutor\n\n  asked whether the bank played a role in charging Trujillo. The\n\n  prosecutor asked if the witness himself made the decision to file a\n\n  criminal case, to which the witness replied, “No.” The prosecutor\n\n  then asked, “[W]ho is it, according to your understanding, that\n\n  makes those decisions on whether a case gets filed criminally?” The\n\n  witness responded, “A complaint’s made to a police department or\n\n  sheriff’s department and they make that decision in conjunction\n\n  with I believe you.” The prosecutor clarified that “you” meant the\n\n  district attorney’s office. The defense did not object.\n\n¶ 34   During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor said,\n\n             Did you hear all that? [Defense counsel]’s\n             talking about all of this stuff, about what\n             Trujillo’s intent was. And then did you hear\n             her towards the end what she did? She says,\n             and correct – this part was correct of what she\n             said. My job is to prove intent, right. That is\n             my burden. And she’s absolutely right. The\n             Defendant has every right to remain silent,\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\f            and he exercised that right and that is\n            something that you cannot use against him.\n\n            But it is completely ridiculous for [defense\n            counsel] to get up here and say that [Trujillo]\n            didn’t testify to what his intent was and then\n            to go on and talk about what his intent\n            actually was. We don’t know what his intent\n            was because he never testified to that, which\n            he has every right to do. But did you hear\n            her? She’s up here saying his intent was this.\n\n¶ 35   Trujillo objected on the basis that the prosecutor was\n\n  denigrating defense counsel. The trial court sustained the objection\n\n  as to the prosecutor’s tone, but overruled it as to content. The\n\n  prosecutor then argued, “[I]f you go out and run somebody over and\n\n  – and think that you had the right to do that, is that gonna be a\n\n  legitimate defense by saying, well, I thought I could do that. I didn’t\n\n  – nobody ever told me. Nobody put it in writing. When I bought my\n\n  car, in the instruction manual, nothing said that about that. That’s\n\n  preposterous.” Trujillo did not renew his objection.\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 36   In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, an appellate\n\n  court engages in a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether\n\n  the prosecutor’s conduct was improper based on the totality of the\n\n  circumstances. Wend v. People, 235 P.3d 1089, 1096 (Colo. 2010).\n\n\n                                    14\n\f  Second, we determine whether any misconduct warrants reversal\n\n  under the proper standard of review. Id.\n\n¶ 37   When the alleged misconduct is objected to at trial and is of\n\n  constitutional magnitude, we review for constitutional harmless\n\n  error. Id. When the alleged misconduct is not of a constitutional\n\n  magnitude, and when the defense objected at trial, we subject the\n\n  prosecutorial misconduct to harmless error review. Id. at 1097.\n\n  Such prosecutorial misconduct will be considered harmless\n\n  “whenever there is no reasonable probability that it contributed to\n\n  the defendant’s conviction.” Crider v. People, 186 P.3d 39, 42 (Colo.\n\n  2008). When the defense did not object to the misconduct, we\n\n  review for plain error. Wend, 235 P.3d at 1097-98.\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 38   A prosecutor cannot comment on a “screening process” for\n\n  charging cases “because it both hints that additional evidence\n\n  supporting guilt exists and reveals the personal opinion of the\n\n  prosecutor.” Domingo-Gomez v. People, 125 P.3d 1043, 1052 (Colo.\n\n  2005). It is also improper for a prosecutor to make remarks “for the\n\n  obvious purpose of denigrating defense counsel.” People v. Jones,\n\n  832 P.2d 1036, 1038 (Colo. App. 1991). It is similarly improper for\n\n\n                                   15\n\f  a prosecutor to comment on a defendant’s decision not to testify.\n\n  Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965); see also People v.\n\n  Martinez, 652 P.2d 174, 177 (Colo. App. 1981) (noting that a\n\n  prosecutor’s comment on a defendant’s silence constitutes\n\n  reversible error when “the prosecution argued that such silence\n\n  constituted an implied admission of guilt”).\n\n¶ 39   Nevertheless, “[a] prosecutor is allowed considerable latitude\n\n  in responding to the argument made by opposing counsel.” People\n\n  v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1211 (Colo. App. 1999), aff’d, 43 P.3d\n\n  611 (Colo. 2001). Further, “[a]lthough it is improper for a\n\n  prosecutor to assert that opposing counsel knows that the\n\n  accused’s case is not meritorious,” the prosecutor may permissibly\n\n  argue “that the evidence in support of defendant’s innocence lacked\n\n  substance.” Id. at 1211; see also People v. Samson, 2012 COA 167,\n\n  ¶ 31, 302 P.3d 311, 317 (stating that a prosecutor may permissibly\n\n  “comment on the absence of evidence to support a defendant’s\n\n  contentions”).\n\n¶ 40   Appellate courts consider several factors in determining\n\n  whether prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial, including the\n\n  nature of the error, the pervasiveness of the misconduct, the\n\n\n                                    16\n\f  context, and the overall strength of the evidence supporting the\n\n  conviction. People v. McBride, 228 P.3d 216, 225 (Colo. App. 2009);\n\n  see also Crider, 186 P.3d at 43. For example, a reviewing court may\n\n  consider whether proper jury instructions mitigated the prejudicial\n\n  effect of prosecutorial misconduct. See People v. Castillo, 2014 COA\n\n  140M, ¶ 78, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (concluding prosecutor’s\n\n  misstatements were harmless in light of instructions from the trial\n\n  court and the defense’s closing argument) (cert. granted in part Nov.\n\n  23, 2015).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n¶ 41   Trujillo contends that three instances of prosecutorial\n\n  misconduct require reversal. We disagree.\n\n¶ 42   Trujillo first contends that the prosecutor improperly referred\n\n  to a screening process while examining the expert witness. We\n\n  perceive no prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor here did not\n\n  imply that he had engaged in a screening process to “weed out the\n\n  weaker cases and, implicitly, that the State d[id] not consider this a\n\n  weak case.” Domingo-Gomez, 125 P.3d at 1052 (concluding the\n\n  prosecutor’s comment that “it takes a lot more than somebody\n\n  saying that person did it” to bring charges was improper). Rather,\n\n\n                                    17\n\f  the prosecutor clarified that the bank did not bring criminal\n\n  charges and that the witness himself did not stand to gain as a\n\n  result of Trujillo’s conviction. The People assert, and we agree, that\n\n  the prosecutor’s question merely elicited testimony to establish that\n\n  the district attorney’s office was responsible for pursuing the\n\n  criminal charges against Trujillo.\n\n¶ 43   Second, Trujillo asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly\n\n  commented on his decision not to testify. We disagree. Even if we\n\n  assume the comment on Trujillo’s decision not to testify was\n\n  improper, not every comment on a defendant’s choice not to testify\n\n  requires reversal. See Martinez, 652 P.2d at 177. “The determining\n\n  factor is whether the defendant’s silence was used by the\n\n  prosecution as a means of creating an inference of guilt,” id., and\n\n  we conclude that the prosecutor’s comments here did not raise\n\n  such an inference.\n\n¶ 44   Finally, Trujillo contends that the prosecutor impermissibly\n\n  denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of the case\n\n  during rebuttal closing argument. We agree that the prosecutor\n\n  improperly denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of\n\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\f  the case when he characterized her arguments as “completely\n\n  ridiculous” and “preposterous.”\n\n¶ 45   However, we perceive no basis for reversal as a result of these\n\n  improper remarks. The comments were limited to the People’s\n\n  rebuttal closing argument. Moreover, significant evidence\n\n  corroborated the jury’s finding of guilt — specifically, the\n\n  undisputed evidence that Trujillo had removed an extensive amount\n\n  of property from the house. Viewing the record as a whole, we\n\n  cannot say that there was a “reasonable probability” that the\n\n  prosecutor’s remarks denigrating defense counsel contributed to\n\n  Trujillo’s convictions. See Crider, 186 P.3d at 42. Thus, we\n\n  determine the error was harmless.\n\n¶ 46   In sum, though we agree that the prosecutor improperly\n\n  denigrated defense counsel, we perceive no basis for reversal.\n\n                       V. Indeterminate Probation\n\n¶ 47   Trujillo contends that the trial court did not have the statutory\n\n  authority to sentence him to indeterminate probation. We disagree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n¶ 48   During the sentencing hearing, the People requested that\n\n  Trujillo be placed on a “long period of probation . . . somewhere in\n\n\n                                    19\n\f  the neighborhood of eight to ten years” because they anticipated\n\n  that Trujillo would be ordered to pay substantial restitution.2\n\n  Trujillo requested unsupervised probation with a collections\n\n  investigator monitoring his restitution payments.\n\n¶ 49   The trial court imposed an “indefinite probation sentence”\n\n  because of the substantial restitution that Trujillo was expected to\n\n  owe. In imposing an indeterminate probation sentence, the trial\n\n  court stated, “There is case law that talks about whether\n\n  [indeterminate probation] is something that can or should be\n\n  imposed and it’s certainly something that is allowed regardless of\n\n  the type of conviction that has been entered.”\n\n¶ 50   The mittimus states that the sentence imposed was a term of\n\n  probation for seven years to life.\n\n                          B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 51   The People contend that we should not consider this claim\n\n  because a sentence to probation is not ordinarily subject to\n\n\n\n  2 The trial court ultimately ordered Trujillo to pay $171,421.97 in\n  restitution. Trujillo separately appealed that order, and a division\n  of this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for\n  reconsideration. People v. Trujillo, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2486, Oct.\n  5, 2017) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)).\n\n                                       20\n\f  appellate review. However, “where, as here, a defendant contends\n\n  that ‘a court has exceeded its statutory authority’ in imposing a\n\n  probationary sentence, appellate review is warranted.” People v.\n\n  Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, ¶ 10, 305 P.3d 420, 423 (quoting People v.\n\n  Rossman, 140 P.3d 172, 174 (Colo. App. 2006)).\n\n¶ 52   “We review sentencing decisions that are within the statutory\n\n  range for an abuse of discretion.” People v. Torrez, 2013 COA 37,\n\n  ¶ 71, 316 P.3d 25, 37. However, where the defendant contends that\n\n  a court exceeded its statutory sentencing authority, our inquiry\n\n  involves statutory interpretation. Jenkins, ¶ 12, 305 P.3d at 423.\n\n  We review such issues of statutory interpretation de novo. Id.\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 53   Under section 18-1.3-202(1)(a), C.R.S. 2017, a trial court “may\n\n  grant the defendant probation for such period and upon such terms\n\n  and conditions as it deems best.” Further, “[t]he length of probation\n\n  shall be subject to the discretion of the court and may exceed the\n\n  maximum period of incarceration authorized for the classification of\n\n  the offense of which the defendant is convicted.” Id.\n\n¶ 54   In Jenkins, a division of this court concluded that section 18-\n\n  1.3-202(1) “authorizes a trial court to impose an indeterminate term\n\n\n                                   21\n\f  of probation.” Jenkins, ¶ 38, 305 P.3d at 426. The Jenkins division\n\n  bolstered its conclusion by looking to the plain language of the\n\n  statute — which the division noted “contemplate[s] both\n\n  determinate and indeterminate terms of probation” — and to the\n\n  provision’s legislative history. Id. at ¶¶ 40, 42, 46, 305 P.3d at 426-\n\n  28. Finally, the division noted that section 18-1.3-202(1) “generally\n\n  pertains to a broad class of cases, and it simply allows a trial court\n\n  to elect an indeterminate term if it sentences an offender who has\n\n  been convicted of a felony to probation.” Id. at ¶ 50, 305 P.3d at\n\n  428 (upholding probationary sentence of ten years to life); see also\n\n  People v. Martinez, 844 P.2d 1203, 1206 (Colo. App. 1992)\n\n  (concluding that a trial court has authority to impose a term of\n\n  probation that exceeds the sentence to imprisonment in the\n\n  statutory aggravated range for an offense).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n¶ 55   Trujillo asserts that the trial court exceeded its statutory\n\n  authority in imposing an indeterminate probationary sentence. We\n\n  disagree.\n\n¶ 56   Like the Jenkins division, we conclude that section 18-1.3-\n\n  202(1) gives a trial court the authority to sentence a defendant\n\n\n                                    22\n\f  convicted of a felony to an indefinite probationary period. Trujillo\n\n  urges that the statute limits a trial court’s authority to impose an\n\n  indeterminate probation sentence. Under Trujillo’s logic, a sentence\n\n  to probation for 100 years is permissible, but an indeterminate\n\n  probation sentence is outside the trial court’s statutory authority.\n\n  The statute offers no basis for reaching this conclusion.\n\n¶ 57   Trujillo asserts that Jenkins is distinguishable because that\n\n  case concerned whether a defendant convicted of a sex offense not\n\n  falling under the supervision scheme of the Colorado Sex Offender\n\n  Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998 (SOLSA), see §§ 18-1.3-1001\n\n  to -1012, C.R.S. 2017, could nevertheless be sentenced to\n\n  indeterminate probation. Jenkins, ¶ 1, 305 P.3d at 422. Trujillo\n\n  contends that Jenkins was limited to the particular circumstances\n\n  of that case, and does not widely apply to all offenses and\n\n  defendants. However, the Jenkins division made clear that section\n\n  18-1.3-202(1) “establishes a general rule as far as the possibility of\n\n  an indeterminate probationary term for felonies” and “authorizes a\n\n  trial court to impose an indeterminate term of probation.” Id. at\n\n  ¶¶ 38, 50, 305 P.3d at 426, 428. In fact, Jenkins explicitly rejected\n\n  the argument that a sentence of indeterminate probation could be\n\n\n                                    23\n\f  imposed only in sex offense cases subject to SOLSA. Id. at ¶¶ 49-\n\n  50, 305 P.3d at 428. Thus, Trujillo’s argument that Jenkins is\n\n  limited to sex offenses is unavailing.\n\n¶ 58   In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its\n\n  statutory authority in imposing the probation sentence here.\n\n                         VI. Costs of Prosecution\n\n¶ 59   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in awarding the\n\n  full costs of prosecution requested by the People without making a\n\n  finding on whether any portion of the costs was attributable to the\n\n  charge on which he was acquitted. We agree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n¶ 60   Before sentencing, the People moved for reimbursement of the\n\n  costs of prosecution pursuant to section 18-1.3-701, C.R.S. 2017.\n\n  The People requested $768.70. Trujillo opposed the motion on the\n\n  basis that the People bore responsibility for the costs incurred to\n\n  prove the defrauding a secured creditor charge, of which Trujillo\n\n  was acquitted.\n\n¶ 61   During the sentencing hearing, the trial court awarded the\n\n  requested costs of prosecution, ordering Trujillo to pay $768.70.\n\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\f                          B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 62   The trial court, in its discretion, may assess reasonable and\n\n  necessary costs of prosecution against a convicted defendant. See\n\n  § 18-1.3-701(2)(j.5). Thus, we review an assessment of costs of\n\n  prosecution for an abuse of discretion, reversing if the trial court’s\n\n  determination is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair,\n\n  People v. Palomo, 272 P.3d 1106, 1110 (Colo. App. 2011), or if the\n\n  trial court misapplied the law, People v. Jefferson, 2017 CO 35,\n\n  ¶ 25, 393 P.3d 493, 499.\n\n                             C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 63   Under section 16-18-101(1), C.R.S. 2017, the state bears the\n\n  costs of prosecution when a defendant is acquitted. Such costs\n\n  may include witness fees, mileage, lodging expenses, transportation\n\n  costs, and other reasonable and necessary costs that directly result\n\n  from prosecuting the defendant. § 18-1.3-701(2); see also People v.\n\n  Sinovcic, 2013 COA 38, ¶¶ 15-16, 304 P.3d 1176, 1179. If a\n\n  defendant is convicted of fewer than all of the charged counts, the\n\n  court may assess only those costs attributable to the counts for\n\n  which the defendant was convicted, if an allocation is practicable.\n\n  Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1112.\n\n\n                                    25\n\f                               D. Analysis\n\n¶ 64   Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in not making a\n\n  finding as to whether some portion of the requested costs of\n\n  prosecution were allocable to the acquitted charge. We agree.\n\n¶ 65   As Trujillo concedes, it is possible that the costs cannot be\n\n  allocated between the charge on which he was acquitted and the\n\n  two charges on which he was convicted. However, the trial court\n\n  did not find that such an allocation was impracticable. Because the\n\n  trial court was required to consider whether some portion of the\n\n  requested costs was practicably attributable to the acquitted\n\n  charge, the trial court abused its discretion. See DeBella v. People,\n\n  233 P.3d 664, 667 (Colo. 2010) (failure to exercise discretion\n\n  constitutes an abuse of the court’s discretion).\n\n¶ 66   Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding the People costs of\n\n  prosecution and remand for the trial court to make appropriate\n\n  findings of fact and “assess only those costs that are related to the\n\n  prosecution of the . . . counts of which [Trujillo] was convicted, to\n\n  the extent an allocation is practicable.” Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1113.\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\f                    VII. Amendment to Theft Statute\n\n¶ 67   Trujillo contends that he should have benefited from an\n\n  amendment to the theft statute reclassifying theft between $20,000\n\n  and $100,000 as a class 4 felony. We agree.\n\n                            A. Additional Facts\n\n¶ 68   The General Assembly amended the theft statute on June 5,\n\n  2013. See Ch. 373, sec. 1, § 18-4-401, 2013 Colo. Sess. Laws\n\n  2196. Under the amended statute, theft between $20,000 and\n\n  $100,000 constitutes a class 4 felony. See § 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S.\n\n  2017. Prior to the amendment, theft over $20,000 constituted a\n\n  class 3 felony. § 18-4-401(2)(d), C.R.S. 2011.\n\n¶ 69   Trujillo was charged with theft of $20,000 or more in April\n\n  2011. He was convicted in October 2013 and sentenced in\n\n  December 2013. His theft conviction was recorded on the mittimus\n\n  as a class 3 felony.\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 70   The People assert that, because Trujillo did not make this\n\n  argument before the trial court, we should review only for plain\n\n  error. However, the division in People v. Stellabotte rejected this\n\n  argument. 2016 COA 106, ¶ 42, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (noting that plain\n\n\n                                    27\n\f  error review was inappropriate because “a defendant may raise a\n\n  claim at any time that his or her sentence was not authorized by\n\n  law”) (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Following Stellabotte, we review\n\n  the legality of the sentence de novo. Id. at ¶ 4, ___ P.3d at ___.\n\n                             C. Applicable Law\n\n¶ 71   In determining whether to apply amendments to legislation,\n\n  we first look to the plain language of the statute. People v.\n\n  Summers, 208 P.3d 251, 253-54 (Colo. 2009). If a statute explicitly\n\n  states that it applies only to offenses committed after the effective\n\n  date, it must be applied accordingly. See People v. McCoy, 764 P.2d\n\n  1171, 1174 (Colo. 1988).\n\n¶ 72   As a general rule, “[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in\n\n  its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S. 2017. However, if a statute is\n\n  silent as to whether it applies only prospectively, a defendant may\n\n  seek retroactive application if he or she benefits from a significant\n\n  change in the law. § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017; see also People\n\n  v. Thornton, 187 Colo. 202, 203, 529 P.2d 628, 628 (1974) (allowing\n\n  defendant to seek relief on direct appeal under statute).\n\n¶ 73   In Stellabotte, a division of this court concluded that the\n\n  amendatory theft legislation “applies retroactively to cases pending\n\n\n                                    28\n\f  in the trial court when the amendment was enacted.” Stellabotte,\n\n  ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___; People v. Patton, 2016 COA 187, ¶ 32, ___ P.3d\n\n  ___, ___; see also People v. Patton, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2359, Aug.\n\n  11, 2016) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)) (cert. granted\n\n  Feb. 6, 2017).\n\n                                D. Analysis\n\n¶ 74   Trujillo contends that the amendment to the theft statute\n\n  requires that we vacate his sentence and remand for the trial court\n\n  to enter his theft conviction as a class 4 felony. We agree.\n\n¶ 75   As the division noted in Stellabotte, the theft amendment does\n\n  not explicitly state that it is either retroactive or prospective.\n\n  Stellabotte, ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___. In the face of this legislative\n\n  silence, the division held that a defendant who committed theft\n\n  prior to the statutory amendment but was not convicted until after\n\n  its passage was entitled to the benefit retroactively. See id. at\n\n  ¶¶ 39, 45, ___ P.3d at ___. The same is true here.\n\n¶ 76   Trujillo was charged with theft before the statute was\n\n  amended, but was not convicted or sentenced until after the\n\n  General Assembly lowered the classification for theft between\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\f  $20,000 and $100,000.3 Thus, like the defendant in Stellabotte,\n\n  Trujillo is entitled to the benefit of the amendment. As a result, we\n\n  vacate the sentence for the theft conviction and remand for the\n\n  conviction to be entered as a class 4 felony.\n\n¶ 77   The partial dissent looks to several statutory provisions in\n\n  support of its conclusion that Trujillo is not entitled to the benefit of\n\n  the amendatory legislation. First, the partial dissent cites section\n\n  2-4-202, which states the general presumption that statutes apply\n\n  prospectively. However, as the division noted in Stellabotte, section\n\n  18-1-410 is a specific exception to the general rule expressed in\n\n  section 2-4-202. Stellabotte, ¶ 47 n.4, ___ P.3d at ___ n.4. We\n\n  agree with that analysis. Thus, the general presumption that\n\n  statutes apply prospectively does not apply here where Trujillo\n\n  seeks the benefit of a “significant change in the law, . . . allowing in\n\n\n\n\n  3 Trujillo asserts that the theft was between $20,000 and $100,000\n  based on testimony from trial. The People do not contest the value\n  of the stolen property in this case. We therefore assume that\n  Trujillo’s offense properly fell within the value range set forth in\n  section 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S. 2017.\n\n                                     30\n\f  the interests of justice retroactive application of the changed legal\n\n  standard.”4 § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).\n\n¶ 78   The partial dissent also invokes section 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017,\n\n  in support of its conclusion. Section 2-4-303 states:\n\n             The repeal, revision, amendment, or\n             consolidation of any statute or part of a statute\n             or section or part of a section of any statute\n             shall not have the effect to release, extinguish,\n             alter, modify, or change in whole or in part any\n             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, either civil or\n             criminal, which shall have been incurred\n             under such statute, unless the repealing,\n             revising, amending, or consolidating act so\n             expressly provides.\n\n¶ 79   However, the supreme court has noted that the “general\n\n  saving” provision codified in this statute is not applicable to\n\n  criminal cases; instead, the court noted in dictum that it “has\n\n\n  4 The partial dissent also asserts that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I),\n  C.R.S. 2017, does not provide any relief to Trujillo because that\n  provision requires that “there has been significant change in the\n  law, applied to the [defendant’s] conviction or sentence.” The\n  partial dissent asserts that the phrase “applied to” requires that the\n  legislation expressly state that it applies retroactively. We disagree\n  with that interpretation, and believe that our view finds authority in\n  supreme court case law. See People v. Thomas, 185 Colo. 395, 397,\n  525 P.2d 1136, 1137 (1974) (noting that “[t]he legislature intended\n  the changed legal standards to apply wherever constitutionally\n  permissible” but making no mention of whether the amendatory\n  legislation reclassifying attempted second degree burglary explicitly\n  stated that it applied retroactively).\n\n                                     31\n\f  consistently adhered to the principle . . . that a defendant is entitled\n\n  to the benefits of amendatory legislation when relief is sought before\n\n  finality has attached to the judgment of conviction.” Noe v. Dolan,\n\n  197 Colo. 32, 36 n.3, 589 P.2d 483, 486 n.3 (1979).\n\n¶ 80   In People v. Boyd, a division of the court of appeals concluded\n\n  that section 2-4-303 did not prevent the retroactive effect of an\n\n  amendatory constitutional provision. 2015 COA 109, ¶ 27, 395\n\n  P.3d 1128, 1134, aff’d, 2017 CO 2, 387 P.3d 755.5 The division\n\n  noted the supreme court’s language in Noe. Id. at ¶ 28, 395 P.3d at\n\n  1134. To the extent that other supreme court cases included\n\n  contrary statements, the Boyd division concluded that such\n\n  statements were dicta and that the supreme court had not\n\n  overruled or disapproved of either Noe or People v. Thomas, 185\n\n  Colo. 395, 398, 525 P.2d 1136, 1138 (1974) (holding that\n\n  “amendatory legislation mitigating the penalties for crimes should\n\n  be applied to any case which has not received final judgment”).\n\n\n\n  5 The supreme court in Boyd affirmed the Court of Appeals decision\n  on different grounds, concluding that the marijuana criminal\n  offense statute had been rendered inoperative by Amendment 64.\n  Neither the majority nor the dissent in Boyd cited section 2-4-303,\n  C.R.S. 2017.\n\n                                    32\n\f  Boyd, ¶¶ 29-30, 395 P.3d at 1134-35. Finally, the Boyd division\n\n  concluded that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) controls over section 2-4-\n\n  303 because the former sets forth a specific exception to the latter,\n\n  which codifies a “general rule[] of construction regarding\n\n  prospective effect for amendatory legislation.” Id. at ¶¶ 31-32, 395\n\n  P.3d at 1135. We agree with the Boyd division’s analysis and\n\n  therefore do not perceive section 2-4-303 as a bar to the relief\n\n  Trujillo seeks.\n\n¶ 81   In making its statutory arguments, the partial dissent relies\n\n  on the plain meaning of both section 2-4-303 and section 18-1-\n\n  410(1)(f)(I). However, as discussed, the supreme court has not\n\n  given either provision its plain meaning. Despite express reference\n\n  in section 2-4-303 to civil and criminal penalties, the supreme court\n\n  has indicated that the provision does not apply to criminal cases.\n\n  Noe, 197 Colo. at 36 n.3, 589 P.2d at 486 n.3. Similarly, while\n\n  section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) by its express terms applies to defendants\n\n  seeking postconviction relief, the supreme court has held that the\n\n  statute also extends to defendants seeking relief on direct appeal.\n\n  Thornton, 187 Colo. at 203, 529 P.2d at 628. In light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f  supreme court’s interpretation of these statutes, we cannot give\n\n  them the meanings that the partial dissent ascribes to them.\n\n¶ 82   Finally, the partial dissent also relies on Riley v. People, in\n\n  which the supreme court noted that it has “emphasized that a\n\n  defendant is not entitled to the ameliorative effects of amendatory\n\n  legislation if the General Assembly has not clearly indicated its\n\n  intent to require such retroactive application.” 828 P.2d 254, 258\n\n  (Colo. 1992). However, we do not consider this statement to have\n\n  the controlling effect the partial dissent gives it. In Riley, the\n\n  defendant committed a crime in April 1988 and sought relief under\n\n  two sentencing provisions that expressly stated they applied to acts\n\n  “committed on or after” July 1, 1988. Id. at 255-56. The Riley\n\n  court held the defendant there was not entitled to relief because\n\n  applying the statutes retroactively would require the court to ignore\n\n  the “clear legislative determination” that the amended sentencing\n\n  provisions would apply only to acts after that date. Id. at 257.\n\n¶ 83   Thus, Riley is readily distinguishable from the present case,\n\n  where the amendments to the theft statute do not expressly provide\n\n  an effective date, and the language relied on by the partial dissent is\n\n  dicta. Accord McCoy, 764 P.2d at 1174 (noting that, where\n\n\n                                     34\n\f  legislation expressly stated it applied to acts committed on or after\n\n  its effective date, a “defendant does not receive any ameliorative\n\n  benefit” because “retroactive application of the amendatory\n\n  legislation is clearly not intended by its own terms”); People v.\n\n  Macias, 631 P.2d 584, 587 (Colo. 1981) (same).\n\n¶ 84   Thus, we conclude, in accordance with Stellabotte, that Trujillo\n\n  should receive the benefit of the amendment to the theft statute\n\n  reclassifying theft between $20,000 and $100,000 as a class 4\n\n  felony. See Stellabotte, ¶ 40, ___ P.3d at ___.\n\n                               VIII. Conclusion\n\n¶ 85   Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The\n\n  sentence is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is\n\n  remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views\n\n  expressed in this opinion.\n\n       JUDGE RICHMAN concurs.\n\n       JUDGE FURMAN concurs in part and dissents in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f          JUDGE FURMAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n¶ 86      I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion only as to the\n\n  effect of the 2013 amendments to the theft statute. I conclude that\n\n  the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively\n\n  to Trujillo’s case. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.\n\n¶ 87      First, the General Assembly has made it clear that a “statute is\n\n  presumed to be prospective in its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S.\n\n  2017. The 2013 amendments to the theft statute are silent as to\n\n  whether they apply prospectively or retroactively. Therefore, I\n\n  presume that the 2013 amendments are prospective in operation\n\n  and do not apply to Trujillo’s offense, which occurred before 2013.\n\n  See id.\n\n¶ 88      Second, an amendment to a criminal statute does not change\n\n  the penalty for crimes already committed under the statute unless\n\n  the amendatory legislation expressly provides for such a change.\n\n  See § 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017. Section 2-4-303 provides, in relevant\n\n  part:\n\n               The . . . amendment . . . of any statute or part\n               of a statute . . . shall not have the effect to\n               release, extinguish, alter, modify, or change in\n               whole or in part any penalty, forfeiture, or\n               liability, either civil or criminal, which shall\n\n\n                                      36\n\f             have been incurred under such statute, unless\n             the . . . amending . . . act so expressly\n             provides, and such statute or part of a statute\n             . . . so . . . amended . . . shall be treated and\n             held as still remaining in force for the purpose\n             of sustaining any and all proper actions, suits,\n             proceedings, and prosecutions, criminal as\n             well as civil, for the enforcement of such\n             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, as well as for\n             the purpose of sustaining any judgment,\n             decree, or order which can or may be rendered,\n             entered, or made in such actions, suits,\n             proceedings, or prosecutions imposing,\n             inflicting, or declaring such penalty, forfeiture,\n             or liability.\n\n  Because the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not expressly\n\n  provide that they apply retroactively, and Trujillo committed his\n\n  crime before 2013, he is liable for theft as it was defined when he\n\n  committed the offense. See id.\n\n¶ 89   Third, in Riley v. People, 828 P.2d 254, 258 (Colo. 1992), our\n\n  supreme court “emphasized that a defendant is not entitled to the\n\n  ameliorative effects of amendatory legislation if the General\n\n  Assembly has not clearly indicated its intent to require such\n\n  retroactive application.” Id. I consider this statement by the\n\n  supreme court about its own jurisprudence on this issue to be\n\n  controlling.\n\n\n\n\n                                    37\n\f¶ 90   Fourth, section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017, does not allow\n\n  Trujillo, on direct appeal, to seek retroactive application of the 2013\n\n  amendments to his case. Section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) allows a\n\n  defendant to seek retroactive application of a “significant change in\n\n  the law, applied to” a defendant’s “conviction or sentence.” I believe\n\n  that the phrase “applied to” reflects the General Assembly’s intent\n\n  that, for amendatory legislation to apply retroactively to a\n\n  defendant’s conviction or sentence, the legislation must state that it\n\n  applies retroactively. Thus, because, as noted, the 2013\n\n  amendments do not state that they apply retroactively to Trujillo’s\n\n  conviction and sentence, he may not seek retroactive application\n\n  under section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).\n\n¶ 91   Finally, and with all due respect, I decline to follow People v.\n\n  Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106 (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Indeed, I\n\n  agree with Judge Dailey’s dissent in Stellabotte. See id. at ¶¶ 62-70\n\n  (Dailey, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n\n\n\n                                     38\n\f&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;FreeLaw\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nsql queries and inserts\n\nI have a random question.

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in paediatric IBD patients has revealed that the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci were associated with primary non response \\[[@ref12]\\]. Furthermore, although TNFa gene is of great interest as a candidate gene for pharmacogenetic approaches few studies have been performed to date and some have led to contradictory results \\[[@ref10],[@ref11],[@ref13]-[@ref15]\\].\n\nAll anti-TNF agents share an IgG1 Fc fragment, but the contribution of the Fc portion to the response to treatment among currently used TNF blockers remains unknown. Receptors for IgG-Fc portion (FcR) are important regulatory molecules of inflammatory responses. FcR polymorphisms alter receptor function by enhancing or diminishing the affinity for immunoglobulins \\[[@ref16]\\]. Three major classes of FcR that are capable of binding IgG antibodies are recognised: FcγRΙ (CD64), FcγRΙΙ (CD32), and FcγRΙΙΙ (CD16). FcγRΙΙ and FcγRΙΙΙ have multiple isoforms (FcγRΙΙΙA/C and B; FcγRΙΙΙA and B) \\[[@ref16]\\]. The most frequent polymorphism of *FcγRΙΙΙA* is a point mutation affecting amino acids in codon 158 in the extracellular domain. This results in either a valine (V158) or a phenylalanine (F158) at this position. Recently, it has been reported that CD patients with *FcγRΙΙΙA* -158V/V genotype had a better biological and possibly better clinical response to IFX \\[[@ref17]\\]. However, further studies did not confirm this observation \\[[@ref18]\\].\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess whether the *TNF* and/ or *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene polymorphisms are genetic predictors of response to IFX, in a cohort of Greek patients with adult or paediatric onset of CD.\n\nPatients - Methods {#sec1-2}\n==================\n\nPatients {#sec2-1}\n--------\n\nWe enrolled 106 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CD attending the outpatient IBD Clinic at the 1^st^ Department of Gastroenterology, \&quot;Evangelismos\&quot; Hospital (79 adults) or the 1^st^ Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Athens \&quot;Aghia Sophia\&quot;(27 children). The diagnosis of CD was based on standard clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological criteria \\[[@ref1],[@ref19]\\]. Eligible patients should have inflammatory (luminal) disease and be naive to IFX.\n\nIFX was administered intravenously at a dose of 5mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks. Clinical and serological responses were assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) \\[[@ref20]\\] and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively, at baseline (before the 1st infusion of IFX), the day before each subsequent IFX infusion and after 12 weeks of treatment. Ileocolonoscopy was performed by a single endoscopist (GJM) at baseline and after 12-20 weeks of therapy to assess mucosal healing. Any changes in endoscopic appearance compared to baseline endoscopy were classified in four categories \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\] \\[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\&quot;table\&quot;}\\]. Patients were classified in accordance to response to IFX therapy as shown in [table 2](#T2){ref-type=\&quot;table\&quot;}. The ethical committee of the participating hospitals approved the study. Research was carried out according to Helsinki Convention (1975) and written inform consent was obtained in advance from each patient.\n\n###### \n\nGrading of endoscopic mucosal lesions \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\]\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g001)\n\n###### \n\nClassification of the study population due to response to infliximab therapy\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g002)\n\nGenotyping {#sec2-2}\n----------\n\nGenomic DNA from whole blood containing EDTA was extracted using standard techniques (NucleoSpin Blood kit, Macherey-Nagel, Germany). All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were run under conditions previously described \\[[@ref23]\\]. Primer sequences for the gene polymorphism at --308 were forward 5′-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3′, for the polymorphism at −238 forward 5′-ATC TGG AGG AAG CGG TAG TG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGA AGA CCC CCC TCG GAA CC-3′. The PCR products were digested at 37 °C with NcoI to detect the SNP in the −308 gene allele and MspI to detect the polymorphism of the −238 nucleotide. The -857 C/T polymorphism was analyzed by allele-specific PCR method24 using the primers TNF857-C: 5′-aag gat aag ggc tca gag ag-3′, TNF857-N: 5′-cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc g-3′ and TNF857-M: 5′-t cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc a-3′. The --158V/F polymorphism of FcγRΙΙΙA gene was detected as described by Leppers-van de Straat et al \\[[@ref25]\\] using the primers 5′-CTG AAG ACA CAT TTT TACT CC CAA (A/C)-3′ and 5′-TCC AAA AGC CAC ACT CAA AGA C-3′. The PCR products were then subjected to 3% agarose-gel electrophoresis. \&quot;No target\&quot; controls were included in each PCR batch to ensure that reagents had not been contaminated.\n\nStatistical Analysis {#sec2-3}\n--------------------\n\nGenotype frequencies were compared with the chi-square with Yate's correction using S-Plus (v. 6.2Insightful, Seattle, WA). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with GraphPad (v. 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The p values are all two-sided. Correction for multiple testing was not applied in this study. *P* values of \\< 0.05 were considered to be significant.\n\nResults {#sec1-3}\n=======\n\nPatient demographic and clinical characteristics are given in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type=\&quot;table\&quot;}. There were 68 (64.15%) complete responders, 25 (23.58%) partial responders and 13 (12.26%) non responders to IFX in this study. There were no statistical differences in the mean age, gender, disease duration, location and behavior and smoking habits between complete or partial responders and primary non-responders. There was no disagreement between HBI scores and serum CRP levels. Although, the post-treatment CRP levels were significantly lower in complete responders compared to partial and non-responders, the decrease in CRP levels did not differ significantly between the three groups. Post-treatment CRP levels and mean HBI score were significantly lower in complete responders compared to pre-treatment values in contrast to partial and/or non-responders where the CRP levels and the mean HBI score did not differ significantly.\n\n###### \n\nDemographic, clinical and biological characteristics of the study population\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g003)\n\nThe -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms of the TNF gene and the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene were successfully determined in all subjects. The genotype distribution in complete, partial and non-responders were presented in [Table 4](#T4){ref-type=\&quot;table\&quot;}. No significant difference was observed for the polymorphism tested. In addition, although there may be genetic differences in early (paediatric)-onset and late (adult)-onset CD we were unable to detect any such differences although the number of paediatric patients included in the current study did not allow firm conclusions.\n\n###### \n\nGenotype frequency in complete responders, partial responders and non responders\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g004)\n\nIn the present study, we could not correlate the decrease in serum CRP levels with the genotypes tested in any particular group of patients since in most of the cases serum CRP levels dropped by more than 25% after 12 weeks of treatment. However, no significant decrease in CRP was observed between the TNF genotypes tested. Regarding the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene, the relative decrease in serum CRP levels was greatest in VV homozygotes (78.15 ± 33.68%) and lowest in FF homozygotes (69.84 ± 28.7%) but this difference was not significant. Due to the small number of cases we did not stratify the genotype frequencies according to age.\n\nDiscussion {#sec1-4}\n==========\n\nThe mechanism of IFX action in IBD seems to be multifactorial and the response to IFX is a complex phenomenon influenced by several parameters \\[[@ref1]\\]. Interestingly, a certain proportion of patients do not respond to IFX at all whereas a significant proportion will lose response over time \\[[@ref3]-[@ref7]\\]. This is the first Greek study aiming at identifying any significant associationbetween the -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF gene and the -158V/F polymorphism in *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene and response to IFX in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with CD and it was negative.\n\nEfficacy of IFX was assessed by clinical, serological and endoscopic parameters. Clinical response to IFX was evaluated using the HBI, which has been used in many clinical trials, is simple to use and has shown good correlation with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \\[[@ref26]\\]. Serological evaluation of response to IFX was based on changes in serum levels of CRP, which has shown a good correlation with clinical activity and to a certain degree with endoscopic activity of CD \\[[@ref27]\\]. Finally, endoscopic activity of disease was assessed before and after IFX therapy using a simple description of healing of ulcerative and non ulcerative lesions \\[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\&quot;table\&quot;}\\] as has been previously described \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\]. Endoscopic healing was assessed after 12-20 weeks of IFX treatment. It is conceivable that 12 weeks may be early to assess mucosal healing induced by biologic therapies \\[[@ref27]\\] but the vast majority of patients underwent endoscopy at least 16 weeks after initiation of IFX therapy (average time 17.6 weeks) and therefore it is unlikely that we have not obtained an objective view of the intestinal mucosal at follow up ileocolonoscopy.\n\nRegarding the *TNF* genotypes, our results are in agreement with Louis et al \\[[@ref11]\\] who did not find any significant difference between response groups when genotyped CD patients for the TNF -308G/A polymorphism and compared response rates after IFX treatment. The same results were reported by Mascheretti et al \\[[@ref10]\\] and Dideberg et al \\[[@ref13]\\]. Moreover, our results are in agreement with Tomita et al \\[[@ref28]\\] who reported no significant difference on *TNFa*, *FcgammaRIIA* and *FcgammaRIIIA* between responders and non responders 8 weeks after IFX treatment as well as with results of ACCENT I study where the relative decrease in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment was greatest in -158 VV homozygotes and lowest in FF homozygotes \\[[@ref18]\\]. In contrast, Louis et al \\[[@ref17]\\] observed a significant association between the -158V/F polymorphism in *FcγRΙΙΙA* and both the proportion of patients who had a drop in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment and the magnitude in decrease of serum CRP levels. This may account for the relatively small population of patients in our study, genetic differences in the studied populations and/or methodological differences between studies.\n\nAlthough it would be useful to genetically differentiate 'responders' from 'non-responders', there are not enough data on TNF polymorphisms in IBD and often only selected polymorphisms are genotyped. Small studies have shown possible associations between poor response to IFX and increasing mucosal levels of activated NF-kappaB, homozygosity for the polymorphism in exon 6 of TNFR2 (genotype Arg196Arg), positivity for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and with the presence of increased numbers of activated lamina propia mononuclear cells producing interferon-gamma and TNFa \\[[@ref29]\\].\n\nIn conclusion, our study did not detect any associations between three TNFα gene polymorphisms or the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene and response to IFX in CD. However, in view of discrepant results in the literature large-scale pharmacogenetic studies in different populations, with similar baseline disease phenotypes and treatment protocols are needed to adequately estimate associations between genetic polymorphisms and treatment outcomes.\n\nConflict of interest: None\n\n^a^Evangelismos Hospital, ^b^Laboratory of Biology, School of Medicine, ^c^1^st^ Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Central\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;---------------------- Forwarded by Benjamin Rogers/HOU/ECT on 10/19/2000 \n03:13 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nDplflan@aol.com on 10/18/2000 06:18:51 PM\nTo: Benjamin.Rogers@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: (no subject)\n\n\nBen-\nThis is a lengthy info/doc request - please give me feedback on how best we\ncan close the loop.\n\nThanks\nSusan Flanagan\n\n - DocReq 001013b.doc&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Enron Emails\&quot;\n}&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:891748,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzE1Nywic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL21vbm9sb2d5L3BpbGUtdW5jb3B5cmlnaHRlZCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjc1NywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.ZBYD6zE54t03HJi0s7EVu4QF8ea8Jj52b6naZpYTvzXqens6pZsxQnCAm20PcIJfjkbai7tqAUzrJQBzFeriBA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;monology/pile-uncopyrighted&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;6400d97cf6401f92ccf7c2a2&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/a1bd520681db8cac5ee766e676be6b23.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Devin Gulliver (alt account)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;monology&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:5},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

There’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.

Concept

Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.

Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.

In the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?

In a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.

Hence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.

This is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.

Alas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.

My initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.

Borgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?

The third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.

Conversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.

So the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.

Your plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).

Once spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).

Your pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.

Once a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).

You get points every second for every plate you own.

Over time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.

Setup

No major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.

One big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.

Knowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.

My own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.

Design

Although I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.

For example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.

The problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.

Plus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.

One other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.

In the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.

Originally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.

Development

Development went fast. But not fast enough.

Even though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.

Content-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.

Pastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used

Which is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).

Other non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.

The code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.

To-do list: lots of things were not done

Actual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.

At the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.

One small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).

Argument and user experience

One final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.

And that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.

That doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.

Conclusion

I’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.

The biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.

I’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).

darn it , knowing that I missed your livestream makes me a sad panda ;( but more to the point, the game is … well for a startup its original to say the least ;D it has some really neat ideas and more importantly its designed arround touch screens whitch by the looks of the submission is something rare ;o or that could be just me and my short memory -_-! awesum game, love et &lt;3</span></div></div>

Why was Mundungus banned from the Hog's Head?

In Order of the Phoenix while the trio were in the Hogs Head for the first time plotting the start of Dumbledore's Army, it transpires that ol' Dung was lurking in the pub in a disguise, having been banned 20 years previously according to Sirius. 
Firstly, why was he banned? this could possibly be the tight spot that Albus had helped Dung with in the first place that made him loyal to Albus.  
And secondly, how is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince? (assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) 
They both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. 
Anyone with something in canon or more plausible?

A:

why was he banned?
I'm not able to find any canon data on that, either book text search or interviews transcripts.

how is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince?
In HBP, he's speaking to Aberforth, NOT being inside Hog's Head. The topic was selling stuff he stole from Sirius' place:

Nikki: How did sirius twoway mirror end up with aberforth or is it another twoway mirror?
  J.K. Rowling: You see Aberforth meeting Mundungus in Hogsmeade. That was the occasion on which Dung, who had taken Sirius’s mirror from Grimmauld Place, sold it to Aberforth.
  (src: J.K. Rowling Interview / The Deathly Hallows Web Chat / July 2007)

As a note - this was important since one of the things sold was the 2-way mirror that Harry used to request help when they were imprisoned at Malfoy's in DH.
So, he was banned from the pub (probably, to avoid causing Aberforth's establishment further trouble), but doesn't mean Aberforth won't talk/do business with him otherwise.

There has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?

If the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.

In the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:

Decree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922

Decree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931

These decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.

The official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:

For the provision:
• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health
• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result
• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work
• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle
• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration
• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law

Against the provision:
• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation
• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity
• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation
• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse
• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law

It is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.

Debates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue. What do you think?</span></div></div>

Using M-Test to show you can differentiate term by term.

I have the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\lambda^{n-1}n}{n!}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d}{d\lambda}\big(\frac{\lambda^n}{n!} \big)$
and I would like it to be $\frac{d}{d\lambda}\big(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\lambda^n}{n!})$.
I'm trying to show that this sequence of functions converges uniformly on $(0,\infty)$ and so I'm trying the M-Test.  So I need to find bounds $M_n$ for $\big|\frac{\lambda^n}{n!}\big|$, such that $\sum M_n$ converges.
Thanks.  This is in order to show that I can actually do the differentiation term by term.

A:

You deal with a power series with radius of convergence $R=+\infty$ so you can differentiate term by term.

How to Teach Independence?

How can I teach my toddler to do things independently?

You’ve probably become more patient since you started this whole parenthood thing. And you’re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.

For example, she tells you she can’t finish the puzzle she’s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you’re going to have to tell her you’ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she’s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time.

Remember that children each progress at their own rate. It’s not always fast — and there will be setbacks along the way. But the more you can allow them to do on their own without stepping in, the more they’ll be likely to try for themselves again and again.</span></div></div>

What's the simplest way to pass a file as an argument in a simple shell script?

The following works fine on Mac OS X:
#!/bin/bash
R CMD Sweave myfile.Rnw
pdflatex myfile.tex
open myfile.pdf

Now, I realize that these 3 lines of code are really helpful for my work – independently of some particular file. Thus I'd like to use the file as an argument. I know how to use an argument itself but have problems splitting the input after the string and concat it afterwards. If I was able to split the filename argument like: 
split($1,".") # return some array or list ("name","ext")

Or is there a simpler, completely different way than using Python within a shell script?
Thx in advance for any general advice and examples as well !

A:

I do all my shell scripting in python.
It's easier to read, more powerful and works on windows as well.

A:

You could just take the base name as an argument and use $1.Rnw, $1.tex, and $1.pdf. Python is great for shell scripts, but I usually stick with bash for things less than 10 lines long.
If you really want to take a file name, you can use cut -f 1 -d '.' $1.

In 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.

The top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:—Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).

The nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.

Pete Rose controversy
There was controversy over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.  After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later.  On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography My Prison Without Bars.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the US, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of these deaths. While efforts aimed at treating CAD in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. CAD is commonly treated using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this treatment has increased exponentially since its adoption over three decades ago. Recent questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in CAD is exercise therapy; exercise programs have been shown to have numerous physiological benefits, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated reductions in mortality. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise, the current study is termed "PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise" (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is to determine whether patients randomized to exercise and lifestyle intervention have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Coronary function and anatomy is determined using positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). Our objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI.</span></div></div>

¿Porqué en este loop de JavaScript la impresión de la variable es desde counter y no desde counter-1?

en mi búsqueda por aprender programación por mis propios medios, me he topado con el tema de recursividad y este simple código... mi pregunta ya que la variable counter comienza desde 10 y dentro del loop While el contador resta 1, porqué en la "impresión" aparece desde el 10. Sé que si quisiera empezar desde 10 colocaría el contador en 11... pero obviamente tengo la curiosidad y no entiendo.
var counter = 10;
while(counter > 0) {
    console.log(counter--);
}

resultado:
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1

A:

La razón es simple, en recursividad lo que haces es pasar una variable o arreglo en la mayor parte de los caso para modificarlos o simplemente imprimirlos, en tu caso quieres restar un numero por cada iteracion dentro de tu ciclo while pero aqui lo que tu quieres conseguir es que primero te imprima el 9 por la lógica que encuentras en tu programa y aunque no es del todo errónea eso no sucederá jamas por la siguiente razón.
En tu codigo lo que tienes es la impresion de tu variable e imprimes lo que es counter-- y a pesar de que si te resta -1 en esa misma iteracion sucede que primero te imprimira la variable antes de hacer dicha operacion ya que es lo que primero lee javascript, es como si tu codigo estuviera dividido en dos partes.
EJEMPLO
var counter = 10;
while(counter > 0) {
    console.log(counter); // Lee antes el valor variable
    counter--; // Después realiza operación
}

Esto sucede asi porque es como funciona internamente lo que realizas con javascript ya que a pesar de que parece un metodo simple de resta internamente esta compuesto de dos partes. Para cuando javascript hace la operacion tu valor ya esta en pantalla.
EJEMPLO VISUAL

Primera iteración:
counter = 10 | counter-- | counter = 9
counter = 9 | counter-- | counter = 8
counter = 8 | counter-- | counter = 7
...
counter = 1 | counter-- | counter = 0
counter = 0 | counter-- | counter = -1 -> En este caso ya no cumples con la condición por lo cual nunca se imprime.

Para realizar el proceso que quieres en el caso de que primero quieras que se imprima el 9 entonces deberas de hacer lo siguiente:

var counter = 10;
while(counter > 0) {
    counter--;
    console.log(counter);
}
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }

We were at the store earlier and saw some nice looking haricot verts and heirloom tomatoes, so we decide to assemble a simple salad from those. Of course while I’m at the market, I can’t not get some five peppercorn salami. Our simple dinner of soup, salami, bread, cheese, salad, and wine was on the table in 15 minutes.</span></div></div>

Most absorbent articles include an absorbent pad formed by an absorbent core contained in a wrap comprising a barrier tissue and/or a forming tissue.

Such extensibility permits an absorbent article to extend and expand about the wearer and thus to better conform to the body of the wearer. Such extension and expansion about the wearer is feasible because both the bodyside liner and the outer cover are extensible in at least the one direction.
In conventional structures, the outer cover is typically adhesively secured to the forming tissue of the absorbent pad.

I am the developer of jOOQ, a Java database abstraction framework. I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > "ROM").

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Object Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.

Object/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]

Your query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Sorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your foundation when I wrote my original post. I understand now, that you are concerned with broader concepts than the "common ORM". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping, correct me if I'm wrong).

Yes, I have seen some examples for Ruby's Sequel. I personally find statically-typed languages much better for DSL's as the syntax can be formally defined and checked by a compiler - with the limitations an OO language imposes, of course.

So if I understand this correctly now, "Object Role Modeling" and CQL are actually a more general way of expressing what SQL calls DDL. Since you can already transform CQL into SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE...), and jOOQ can reverse-engineer database schemata into jOOQ generated source code, I don't think there would be need for an additional generator.

Does CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model? The examples I found here only seem to describe what SQL calls "constraints" (although with a much broader functionality-range than SQL):

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

"common ORM". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping

Object Role Modeling was named before Object Relational Mapping, but the latter is now the more common meaning, as you point out. But ORM Lite is actually so-named by Bryan because it is an implementation of Object Role Modeling, not because it is also an O/RM. Bryan was a student of Terry's at Neumont, where he learnt ORM.

Regarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.

lukas.eder:

I don't think there would be need for an additional generator

The problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models. These are almost always very different from the conceptual model, as many relationships have been condensed (absorbed) into attribute/column relationships, so the semantics of the original relationship are lost. In the process, nullable columns are usually introduced, which adds further to the confusion, as such things cannot easily be correctly constrained (uniqueness, etc) in SQL. So by reverse engineering from the relational form, you're losing most of the benefit of building a conceptual model from the start

This may be hard to see for someone used to O-O modeling, and who's authored an O/RM tool. The problem is that O-O suffers from many of the same problems of loss of semantics. The apparently clear notion of "attribute" breaks down when you look at it closely. O-O, although ostensibly behaviour-oriented, introduces attributes to store state, and this attribute orientation is the source of the problem in both cases. Fact-oriented model does not use attributes. Although it may seem obvious that, for example, my surname is an attribute of myself, if the system being modeled accrues the requirement to model families, suddenly surname becomes an attribute of family, and family becomes my attribute. This kind of instability is responsible for much of the rework that's required in evolving legacy systems, as well as many of the mistakes made when they were first modeled. If you want a further example of this loss of semantics, look at my Insurance example, and ask yourself why the VehicleIncident table has a DrivingBloodTestResult column. In fact, if VehicleIncident wasn't explicitly mapped separately, its fields would be in the Claim table.

What's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.

lukas.eder:

Does CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model

Yes, though the published implementation doesn't quite handle the full query syntax (aggregate functions are still missing), nor does it yet translate them to SQL. Some examples are given towards the end of the video presentation on the CQL Introduction page.

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Regarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.

Absolutely. The optimal way to implement SQL in Java would be by extending the Java language itself, such that SQL would be compiled natively by the java compiler, similar to Linq2SQL in C#, or PL/SQL in Oracle databases. So for the complexity of CQL, CQL is certainly the right solution.

Clifford Heath:

The problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models.

You are right. I guess though, that in everyday work, this limitation is not really a problem. Personally, I think if your business rules become so complex that you cannot map them to a relational model easily anymore, then maybe your business rules could be simplified before changing/extending technologies. But that depends on the business, of course. I guess with insurance companies' businesses, I'd be pretty lost, personally ;-)

In any case, I don't see jOOQ as a means to solve modelling issues, or the O/R impedance mismatch (which is even bigger when it comes to mapping your understanding of ORM, with CQL). jOOQ should simply make using the full power of SQL in Java as simple as possible. In that way, jOOQ is not really an ORM because it does not map from objects to the relational world, or try to solve any other high-level abstraction issues. It's really a low-level tool to make a developer's life a lot easier, seeing that unfortunately, JPA CriteriaQuery didn't meet the community's expectations.

I think you're on the right track with this. I hope for you, that this will soon show nice results with a practical implementation. I'm curious to see how you'll tackle performance issues, too, with all the abstraction. Among all attempts to overcome the old and proven relational models (XML databases, NoSQL databases), this one seems the most promising and focused to me!</span></div></div>

Gait properties change with age because of a decrease in lower limb strength and visual acuity or knee joint disorders. Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76.1 (5.7) years). Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and knee joint pain were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Among older adults without vision problems and knee joint pain that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had significantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P &lt; .05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with pain in both knees showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. A decrease of knee extension strength and visual acuity and knee joint pain are factors affecting gait in the female older adults.

Quote:

When for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler’s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.

and the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..
But an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..

The no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.

And thats why PHASE works for quantum metrology and its ability to harness non classical states

Apparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.

It may actually be possible using phase.

Niels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from Werner Heisenberg regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) uncertainty principle. Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.[6] Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:

Quote:

Bohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.

And "quadratures" is about position and momentum..
Which are apparently always orthogonal to each other.

There is obviously something to all of this.

An interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.

For example, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know, with arbitrarily high precision, both the position and momentum of a particle

In 2015, Counterfactual Quantum Computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of "spins of a negatively charged Nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond".[5] Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational efficiency of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle

The quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of "not running" and "running" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the "not running" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.

De-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or ‘phosphorescence’. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons’ magnetic moments"

A composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.

We investigate the construction of two universal three-qubit quantum gates in a hybrid system. The designed system consists of a flying photon and a stationary negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center fixed on the periphery of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator, with the WGM cavity coupled to tapered fibers functioning as an add-drop structure. These gate operations are accomplished by encoding the information both on the spin degree of freedom of the electron confined in the NV center and on the polarization and spatial-mode states of the flying photon, respectively

Now Somewhere in this is evidence of a memristor holding a wavefunction

The shown SPICE implementation (macro model) for a
charge controlled memristor model exactly reproduces the
results from [2]. However, these simulation results do not
have a good compliance - not even qualitatively - with the
characteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.
Therefore the following equations (3) to (9) try to approach
memristor modeling from a different point of view to get a
closer match to the measured curves from [2],[6],[7],[8],[10]
or [11] even with a simple linear drift of w.
Besides the charge steering mechanism of a memristor modelled in [2],
[1] also defined a functional relationship for a memristor
which explains the memristive behavior in dependence on its
magnetic flux: i(t) = W φ(t) · v(t) . (3)

Variable W (φ) represents the memductance which is the
reciprocal of memristance M. Here a mechanism is demanded
that maps the magnetic flux as the input signal to the current
that is flowing through the memristor. The magnetic flux φ
is the integral of voltage v(t) over time: φ = R v(t) dt.
We can assume that an external voltage which is applied to
the previously described two-layer structure has an influence
on the movable 2+-dopants over time. The width w(t) of
the semiconductor layer is depending on the velocity of the
dopants vD(t) via the time integral:
w(t) = w0 + Z0t vD(τ)dτ . (4)

The drift velocity vD in an electric field E is defined via its
mobility µD: vD(t) = µD · E(t) (5) and the electric field E is connected with the voltage via E(t) = v(t)
D(6)with D denoting the total thickness of the two-layer structure
(D = tOX + tSEMI). Due the good conductance of the
semiconductor layer the electric field is applied to the time
depending thickness of the insulator layer tOX for the most
part (due to v(l) = R E dl). However, this was neglected for
reasons of simplification. If we combine (4), (5) and (6), we
obtain: n(t) = w0 + µDD· Z0t v(τ)dτ = w0 + µDD · φ(t) . (7)

This equation shows a proportional dependence of the width w
from the magnetic flux φ. Since the thickness of the insulator
layer is in the low nanometer region a tunnel current or
equivalent mechanism is possible. The magnetic flux slightly
decreases the thickness of the insulator layer wich is the barrierfor the tunnel current.This current rises exponentially with a
reduction of the width tOX(φ) (the exponential dependenceis deducible from the quantum mechanic wave function)

which must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..

because a wavefunction is essentially the "master equation" (which describe wave equations)

We investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.

\\

Notice BACK-ACTION, which goes right back to DARPAs Nanodiamond Biosensors and their ability to overcome the standard quantum limit, because of the known/ prepared states in the ancillas/NITROGEN VACANCIES

Quote:

(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.
Back action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).
Back action is an actively sought-after area of interest in present times. There have been experiments in recent times, with nanomechanical systems, where back action was evaded in making measurements, such as in the following paper :

When performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.
Back-action can also be evaded, allowing measurements with sensitivities that exceed the standard quantum limit, and potentially allowing for the generation of quantum
squeezed states.

So the NV centers are used as ancillas in the measurement process.. which weakly measure wavefunctions of particles in neurons, most likely singlet and triplet states occurring in ATP and phosphase...

then those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..

where the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..
minus the switching which I can explain
Memristors use NV centers to switch between inhibited and excited states
singlet and triplet states
thus producing/simulating/ EMULATING, living neurons and action potentials

and it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be "found"

We hope these novel measurement tools can provide new capabilities to the broader scientific and operational communities,” said Jamil Abo-Shaeer, DARPA program manager. “The work these teams are doing to apply quantum-assisted measurement to biological imaging could benefit DoD’s efforts to develop specialized drugs and therapies, and potentially support DARPA’s work to better understand how the human brain functions.”

"Nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the under-standing of fundamental biological phenomena and for applicationssuch as drug discovery. The advent of novel nano-scale sensors hasgiven hope of achieving the long-standing goal of single-protein, highspatial-resolution structure determination in their natural environ-ment and ambient conditions. In particular, quantum sensors basedon the spin-dependent photoluminescence of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV)centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale en-sembles of external nuclear spins. While NV sensitivity is approachingsingle-spin levels, extracting relevant information from a very com-plex structure is a further challenge, since it requires not only theability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin, butalso to achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution. Here we propose amethod that, by exploiting the coupling of the NV center to an intrin-sic quantum memory associated with the Nitrogen nuclear spin, canreach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution, down to atomic
scales."

So what its all doing essentially, is mapping the phase of atoms/SINGLETS in ATP, onto a NV center based CCD

and at the singlet level, correlations occur.. creating entanglement

so the particles in the neuron are being correlated with the ancillas, the nitrogen vacancies, where they take on the "target" state..

not only is the above imaging done to obtain a correlation to living neurons, via the singlet states within, but once the connection is established, the MEMRISTOR NETWORK itself can be used to RECONSTRUCT VISION IN REAL TIME

Now add the above method, a direct connection using correlated states shared from neurons TO Memristors... and imagine the reconstruction aided by the AI within the memristor network, as it works on so.. (note, this example is done MERELY using fMRI information)
now Imagine statistical ensembles being observed in real time via non-classical entanglement

But what I'm trying to show, is hows its this assumed entanglement based BCI technology, plus the memristor network it is coupled to, that is responsible for the TI communities complaints that "they (the government) can see through my own eyes"

The nitrogen vacancies in the scanners hold values, wavefunctions, which are prepared states aka Ancilla bits, and are the time domain/reference frequency, which carrries the "quantum event/wavefunction" which causes the singlet pairs to form up in the scanned biology..
and correlates with them at the ground state as the relaxation occurs..

Quote:

It is important to realize that particles in singlet states need not be locally bound to each other. For example, when the spin states of two electrons are correlated by their emission from a single quantum event that conserves angular momentum, the resulting electrons remain in a shared singlet state even as their separation in space increases indefinitely over time, provided only that their angular momentum states remain unperturbed

and that weakly measured value, the wavefunction is sent through the optical cavity, teleported to identical nitrogen vacancies in memristors.. so the ground states in both system are correlated and thus the neural activity can be monitored in real time in the memristors</span></div></div>

Python: My return variable is always None

So I found a strange thing that happens in python whenever I try to return an optional parameter or at least I think that is why it is happening.
Here is my code
def reverse(string, output = ""):
    if string == "":
        print "winner: ", output
        return output
    output = output + string[-1]
    string = string[:-1]
    reverse(string, output=output)

And here is what happens when I run it:
>>> output = reverse("hello")
winner:  olleh
>>> print output
None

Anyone know why my return is always None?

A:

You have to return the return value of the recursive call.
def reverse(string, output = ""):
    if string == "":
        print "winner: ", output
        return output
    output = output + string[-1]
    string = string[:-1]
    return reverse(string, output=output)

The present study describes the formulation of a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP1616 and investigates its long-term stability for application as a collector in a bench-scale dissolved air flotation (DAF) prototype. For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 °C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by the 92% oil removal rate in the DAF prototype. The findings demonstrate that the biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus enhances the efficiency of the DAF process, making this technology cleaner. This biosurfactant can assist in the mitigation and management of industrial effluents, contributing toward a reduction in environmental pollution caused by petroleum-based hydrocarbons.</span></div></div>

I would often hear “mine was horrible, but everyone’s pregnancy is different” or “it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life!”

I heard many horror stories which often ended with, “well, don’t worry. You’ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.” Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.

I had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!

Two weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn’t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn’t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.

My husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn’t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn’t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn’t sure what would happen next.

We finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn’t even dilated. I couldn’t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn’t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!

The diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn’t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! “Fake labor” would not be in my cards, I had hoped.

Fortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn’t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn’t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.

“When your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again” the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.

A couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was “if I need something, I’ll let you know. Thanks.” I literally couldn’t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.

As my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.

I had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn’t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!

As I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on … I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn’t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn’t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn’t have to feel any pain with an epidural.

There were no walking epidurals available though and I didn’t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn’t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.

As the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning – a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn’t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn’t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body’s cues.

I started to go along with my body’s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren’t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say “push, his body is stuck!” I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.

The midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn’t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.

When the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I’m glad my husband didn’t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!

While holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn’t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.

Looking into my son’s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It’s true what they say … After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.

At least most of it.

The ideas from TLTP are hereby used in CAL and applied to nursing and health-care undergraduate programmes in one university. In the light of this experience the main intention of this article is to consider the benefits and costs of introducing computer programmes as part of the teaching provision for nurses and other health-care professionals both at beginner and advanced level.

Under low Pi status, Pi uptake into the vacuole was strongly activated compared to high Pi status. Since Pi uptake across the vacuolar membrane is correlated with H+ pumping, we examined the dependency of H+ pumping on plant Pi status. Both H+ pumping and the activities of the vacuolar H+-pumps, the V-type H+-ATPase and the H+-PPase were enhanced under low Pi status. Despite this increase in H+ pumping, Western blot analysis showed no distinct increase in the amount of proton pump proteins.

A:

You need to add:

android:gravity="center"

to the TextView.
This is the only certain way to center the text inside a TextView object or one of its subclasses.
The android:textAlignment is not working in all the cases and as reported by this answer that it has problems in lower API levels.

Python Segmentation Fault?

First off, I didnt even know a memory error / segfault was possible in python. Kudos to learning something new!
I have this database I create
database = DBManager(dbEndpoint,dbUser,dbPass,dbSchema)

And then I try to use it in a thread
def stateTimeThreadStart():
     database.getTable('CLIENTS')

threads = []
threads.append(threading.Thread(name='State Updater', target=stateTimeThreadStart, args=()))
threads[0].start()

The output is 
Segmentation fault: 11

What on earth is going on here? It definetly has something to do with database.getTable('CLIENTS') because when I comment it out the issue does not occur. In addition, I have also tried to pass the database to the thread with no luck. Any ideas?

Segmentation faults in Python can occur due to database connectors. The drivers used to connect to the database are usually coded in a C base, so in case of RAM overload or perhaps other reasons it throws Segmentation Faults.
This is further exacerbated by the fact that you are using multithreading. Most database drivers are known to throw Segmentation Faults if multithreading isn't handled very carefully. Most database driver protocols can not handle multiple threads using the same connection at once.
The rule of thumb is to not share a single connection between threads.

HP MSA70 / P800 Array Failure - Shows 2 drives in each slot, 13/25 drives "missing"

We have an HP MSA70 with 25 x 600GB HP SAS 10k DP drives, connected to an HP P800 controller.  The drives are configured in RAID 6.  
Yesterday, some kind of unknown "event" occurred and the array dropped offline.  We rebooted the server (running CENTOS 6.2) and upon startup, the Array Controller reported that 13 of the drives are "missing".  When we look at the volume in the Array management, there are two entries for each slot for slots 1-12.  One shows a 600gb drive and one shows a 0gb drive.  There are no more entries after 12.
We contacted HP support, who sent us to Tier 2 support, and after many hours gave up.  They said they have never seen this, before (my favorite thing to hear from a vendor).
Has anybody seen this before, and have we lost all of the data?
Thank you.

Old, old, old, old...

CentOS 6.2 is old (6.2, 6 December 2011 (kernel 2.6.32-220))
HP StorageWorks MSA70 is old. (End of Life - October 2010)
HP Smart Array P800 is old. (End of Life - 2010)

So this makes me think that firmware and drivers are also old. E.g. there's no reason to run CentOS 6.2 in 2015... And I'm assuming no effort was made to keep anything current.
This also makes me think that the systems are not being monitored. Assuming HP server hardware, what did the system IML logs say? Are you running HP management agents? If not, important messages about the server and storage health could have been missed.
Did you check information from the HP Array Configuration Utility (or HP SSA)?
But in the end, you've probably suffered a port failure or expander/backplane failure:

How many SAS cables are connected to the enclosure? If 1 cable is connected, then you likely have a backplane issue because of the SAS expander in the enclosure. 
If two cables are connected, you may have a SAS cable, MSA70 controller or P800 port failure.

Your data is likely intact, but you need to isolate the issue and determine which one of the above issues is the culprit. Replacing a SAS cable is a lot easier than swapping the MSA70 controller or RAID controller card... but I guess you can get another MSA70 for $40 on eBay...

I won’t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H &amp; M do resemble me in various ways :)

I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It’s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the “truth” into a story alongside the character’s perceptions. For instance, I think it’s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn’t get it.

When I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master’s point of view. Whether or not he’s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry’s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It’s Martin’s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren’t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you’ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He’s very well-trained.

I think it’s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry’s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change…I don’t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.

Henry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They’re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he’s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn’t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry’s growth has a greater impact on both of them.

It was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn’t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He’s very loving, but he’s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin’s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.

I anticipate going a little deeper into Martin’s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I’ll present from Martin’s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they’re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I’ve already covered from Henry’s perspective to some extent, and when I’m writing Henry, I’m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.

Offering Martin’s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin’s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I’ve gotten the impression (whether it’s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry’s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin’s perspective is a valuable addition.

I plan on adding additional points of view from other characters in the universe. I’ve got stories written about a couple of Henry’s friends to show how slave ownership works in private for other people. I’ve got at least two stories I want to write about Henry’s cousin Jesse. I think Tom gets his own novella :D

With A Proper Lover (GQ Book 2) and A Master’s Fidelity (GQ Book 2.5) released, I’m just going immediately into editing Book 3 and fleshing out the notes I have for the Martin story. I’d had vague ideas about taking a break, but I honestly don’t know what that would mean at this point. I don’t know what I’d be doing during a break! Right now, the idea of downtime just makes me cranky. Knowing that there are people eager for the next books makes me want to work on getting them out. Besides, working on Martin’s POV is a treat :)</span></div></div>

Hawaii’s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don’t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.

Initial reports indicate that Hawaii’s screwup—which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later—was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.

“You want a system that accounts for the fact that somebody may be sleepy or careless, or an interface may not be the most user-friendly, and yet it all works anyway,” Schatz said. “We have best practices for disaster notifications for natural disasters, for terrorism events. We just don’t have it for this.”

On Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.

“We think it should be done legislatively, but I don’t know that for sure yet,” he told reporters, explaining that the ultimate goal is to craft “a federal law to establish a framework that states can use.”

The way America’s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.

In the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.

That chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.

“That’s a 1950s kind of structure,” Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.

One way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. “That would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,” Simpson said.

But that still wouldn’t solve the problem entirely. “The machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,” Simpson said.

Simpson largely endorsed Schatz’s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. “There’s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,” he said.

In a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.

“That variation is fine for notification about fire, notification about a tsunami coming in,” Simpson said. “But ballistic-missile warnings ought to be consistent, reliable, secure—because we don’t want it cyberattacked—across the entire country.”

Republicans seem receptive to Schatz’s plan for missile-alert legislation. Schatz said he plans to introduce his bill through the Senate Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Republican John Thune. Frederick Hill, a Thune spokesman, told National Journal that the chairman “is considering convening a full committee hearing which would help inform legislative efforts.”

House Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii’s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be “happy to work” with Schatz on legislation, if needed. “We just haven’t got into the weeds on it,” Walden said.

As long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon—as well as the congressional committees that oversee them—will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what’s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.

“It’s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don’t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,” Simpson said.

"Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218."

The present invention relates to a method of forming a composite member, in which a conductive portion is formed in an insulator, the composite member being used in, for example, a wiring board in the fields of electric appliances, electronic appliances and electric and electronic communication. The present invention also relates to a photosensitive composition and an insulating material that can be suitably used in the manufacturing method of the composite member. Further, the present invention relates to a composite member manufactured by the manufacturing method of the present invention and to a multi-layer wiring board and an electronic package including the particular composite member.
In recent years, increase in the degree of integration and miniaturization of various electric and electronic parts including a semiconductor device are being promoted. The particular tendency will be further promoted in the future without fail. In this connection, various measures are being proposed and tried in an attempt to apply a high density mounting to a printed circuit board including formation of a fine pattern and a fine pitch of a metal wiring and formation of a steric wiring.
Particularly, the steric wiring is indispensable to a high density mounting and, thus, various methods are being proposed in an attempt to manufacture a wiring board having a steric wiring. In general, the steric wirings are of a multi-layered structure such as a built-up wiring board prepared by laminating two dimensional printed wiring boards and a multi-layered wiring board. It is difficult to form a steric wiring having a free three dimensional shape. The built-up wiring board or the multi-layered wiring board has a structure that adjacent wiring layers are connected to each other by a conductive column called via. The via is formed by processing an insulating layer by a photolithography process using a photosensitive polyimide or resist, followed by selectively applying a plating to the via or by filling the via with a conductive paste. For forming a via by such a method, it is necessary to repeat a plurality of times the steps of resist coating, light exposure and etching, making the via formation highly laborious. In addition, it is difficult to improve the yield.
It is also possible to form the via by forming a through-hole (via hole) of a predetermined size in an insulating substrate constituting a printed wiring board by using a drill or a CO2 laser, followed by applying plating to the via hole or by filling the via hole with a conductive paste. In these methods, however, it is difficult to form freely a fine via having a size of scores of microns or less at a desired position.
In the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 7-207450, a compound having a hydrophilic group is introduced into pores of three dimensional porous film such as a PTFE film. Under this condition, the film is subjected to a light exposure in a predetermined pattern by using a low pressure mercury lamp (wave lengths of 185 nm and 254 nm), thereby forming the hydrophilic group on the three dimensional porous film. Further, a metal plating is applied to the three dimensional porous film.
In the conventional method described above, however, the material forming the three dimensional porous film is deteriorated because a light beam having a short wavelength is used for the light exposure. Also, the light for the light exposure is absorbed by the three dimensional porous film and, thus, fails to reach the inner region of the porous body, resulting in failure to form fine vias.
Further, in the conventional method described above, the PTFE forming the three dimensional porous film reacts with the light for the light exposure so as to selectively form hydrophilic groups. However, PTFE is defective in that the molding workability is low and that PTFE is costly.
Another method of forming a via is disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 11-24977. In this method, the entire surface of a porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing, for example, a photosensitive reducing agent and a metal salt. Then, a light exposure is applied in a predetermined pattern to the impregnated insulating member so as to reduce the cation of the metal salt in the light exposed portion to a metal nucleus, followed by removing by washing the photosensitive composition in the non-light exposed portion. Further, an electroless plating or a soldering is applied to the residual metal nuclei so as to form vias of a predetermined pattern.
In the method described above, however, the entire surface of the porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing a metal salt as described above, making it difficult to remove completely the metal salt adsorbed on the portion corresponding to the non-exposed portion after the light exposure step. As a result, a difficulty is brought about that the metal nuclei are precipitated on undesired portions in the subsequent reducing step. Such an abnormal deposition of the metal nuclei gives rise to a problem in terms of the insulating properties between adjacent vias and between adjacent wiring layers with progress in the fine pulverization of the pattern.
Also, in the via formed in the insulating substrate by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, the insulating body and the conductive portion are brought into a direct contact. In this case, since the adhesion between the insulating body and the conductive portion is poor, a problem is generated that the conductive portion is peeled off the insulating substrate during the use.
Further, where a multi-layered wiring board is prepared by laminating a plurality of wiring boards manufactured by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, it is required to further improve the electrical connection between the wiring layers of the wiring boards and the conductivity of the wiring.
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, in which deterioration of the insulating body is not brought about by the light exposure, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, which permits manufacturing a composite member at a low manufacturing cost without giving adverse effects to the selectivity of the material of the insulating portion and to the molding workability, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.

Within 3 h of ingesting an imbalanced amino acid diet (IAAD), rats show attenuated intake. The associated conditioned taste aversion can be ameliorated by giving the serotonin3 receptor blocker, tropisetron (TROP). A recent c-fos study indicated that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) may be activated 2-3 h after ingestion of IAAD. In Experiment 1, DMN-lesioned rats (DMNL) or sham-operated (SHAM) rats were injected with saline (SAL) or TROP just before introduction of IAAD. By 3 h, SAL-DMNL rats consumed more (P &lt; 0.01) of the IAAD than did the SAL-SHAM rats. Thereafter, over the next 21 h, the intake of the SAL-DMNL group returned to control levels. TROP treatment enhanced the intake of the treated groups; the TROP and the lesion effect were additive (P &lt; 0.01). By d 4 of receiving the IAAD, the DMNL groups were eating less than SHAM rats (P &lt; 0.05). The data suggest that the DMN may be involved in the early detection of the amino acid deficiency induced by IAAD, is not involved in the TROP effect and is necessary for proper long-term adaptation to an IAAD.</span></div></div>

Today's financial services industry is facing the immense challenge of processing huge amounts of documents efficiently. Predictions that document payment methods would decline have not been realized. In fact, document payment methods have grown worldwide and are expected to continue increasing. There is thus a vital need to devise improved means and methods for processing such documents.
The use of imaging technology as an aid to document processing has been recognized as one way of significantly improving document processing, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,205,780, 4,264,808, and 4,672,186. Generally, imaging involves optically scanning documents to produce electronic images that are processed electronically and stored on high capacity storage media (such as magnetic disc drives and/or optical memory) for later retrieval and display. It is apparent that document imaging provides the opportunity to reduce document handling and movement, since these electronic images can be used in place of the actual documents.
However, despite technological advances in imaging in recent years, prior art document processing systems employing imaging, such as disclosed in the aforementioned patents, do not realized sufficient improvements to justify the added implementations costs.</span></div></div>

No. 14CA0144, People v. Trujillo — Criminal Law — Sentencing
— Probation — Indeterminate Sentence

     A division of the court of appeals considers whether a

Colorado statute authorizes imposition of a sentence to an

indeterminate term of probation and whether the defendant was

entitled to the benefit of amendments to the statute criminalizing

theft. Relying on People v. Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, 305 P.3d 420,

the division concludes that section 18-1.3-202(1), C.R.S. 2017,

provides statutory authority for the imposition of an indeterminate

probation sentence. Following People v. Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106,

___ P.3d ___ (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017), the majority further

concludes that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of

amendments to the theft statute. The partial dissent concludes
that the amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively,

and would therefore affirm the sentence in full.

     Additionally, the division rejects the defendant’s contentions

that reversal is required due to the trial court’s rejection of

defense-tendered jury instructions, wrongfully admitted character

evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct. However, the division

remands for the trial court to make findings of fact concerning the

assessment of the costs of prosecution.

     Accordingly, the division affirms the conviction, affirms the

sentence in part, vacates the sentence in part, and remands the

case with directions.

General, Denver, Colorado, for Plaintiff-Appellee

Douglas K. Wilson, Colorado State Public Defender, James S. Hardy, Deputy
State Public Defender, Denver, Colorado, for Defendant-Appellant
¶1    Defendant, Michael Floyd Trujillo, appeals his judgment of

 conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count

 of theft of more than $20,000 and one count of criminal mischief of

 $20,000 or more. He also appeals his sentence. We perceive no

 basis for reversing his convictions, but remand for the trial court to

 make findings of fact regarding the assessment of the costs of

 prosecution and to reclassify his theft conviction as a class 4 felony.

                            I. Background

¶2    In 2007, Trujillo began building a home, doing much of the

 labor himself and initially using his own money to fund the project.

 He later took out a construction loan from the victim, a bank, for

 just under $255,000. After construction was completed on the

 house, Trujillo stopped making his monthly loan payments. The

 bank declined to restructure the loan and initiated foreclosure

 proceedings in September 2010.

¶3    Before the foreclosure sale, Trujillo removed or destroyed

 property in the house, including kitchen cabinets, countertops,

 interior and exterior doors, doorjambs and casings, flooring,

 baseboards, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, the fireplace,

 handrails, the boiler, the air conditioner, and the garage door.


                                    1
 Because of this damage, the house was appraised at $150,000;

 however, the appraiser estimated that if the house were in good

 repair, it would have been worth $320,000.

¶4    Trujillo was charged with defrauding a secured creditor, theft

 of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000, and criminal mischief

 of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000. The jury found him

 not guilty of defrauding a secured creditor and guilty of theft and

 criminal mischief.

¶5    On appeal, Trujillo raises six contentions: (1) the trial court

 erred in rejecting defense-tendered jury instructions; (2) the trial

 court erred in allowing evidence of a prior foreclosure against

 Trujillo; (3) prosecutorial misconduct during direct examination of a

 witness and closing rebuttal argument warrants reversal; (4) the

 trial court imposed an illegal sentence of indeterminate probation;

 (5) the trial court erred in awarding the People costs of prosecution;

 and (6) an amendment to the theft statute applies to his conviction.

 We perceive no basis for reversal with respect to the first four

 contentions, but agree with Trujillo’s final two contentions. We

 therefore affirm the convictions and the sentence in part but vacate

 the sentence in part and remand with directions.


                                    2
                          II. Jury Instructions

¶6    Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in rejecting various

 jury instructions regarding his theory of the case. We disagree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶7    Throughout trial, the defense’s theory of the case was that

 Trujillo lacked the requisite intent to commit the charged offenses

 because he believed that the property he removed from the house

 belonged to him. The defense tendered five jury instructions related

 to this theory of the case.

¶8    Trujillo’s tendered jury instructions detailed property law

 concepts. For example, the first tendered instruction stated that

 “the person who has title to real property is still the owner of the

 property even if there is a lien or secured interest on the property.”

 Another tendered instruction defined “title,” “deed of trust,” and

 “holder of a certificate of purchase[].” One instruction described the

 lien theory detailed in section 38-35-117, C.R.S. 2017, and another

 instructed that title to property “does not vest with the purchaser

 until eight days after [a] foreclosure sale.”

¶9    The trial court declined to give these instructions as tendered.

 However, portions of the defense-tendered instructions were


                                     3
  included in a final definitional jury instruction. The final

  instructions defined “deed of trust” and stated that the title to

  property is transferred to the holder of the certificate of purchase

  eight days after a foreclosure sale. Though it rejected other

  portions of the defense-tendered instructions, the trial court

  permitted defense counsel to argue the issues raised in the

  instructions during closing argument.

¶ 10   The defense also tendered an instruction which the trial court

  modified and gave as a theory of the case instruction. That

  instruction stated, “Trujillo contends that the items removed from

  the home . . . were his; purchased by him and installed by him. . . .

  Trujillo conten[d]s that the items that he took and damaged were

  his sole property.”

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 11   We review jury instructions de novo to determine whether, as

  a whole, they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.

  Riley v. People, 266 P.3d 1089, 1092-93 (Colo. 2011). If the jury

  instructions properly inform the jury of the law, the district court

  has “broad discretion to determine the form and style of jury

  instructions.” Day v. Johnson, 255 P.3d 1064, 1067 (Colo. 2011).


                                     4
  Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision concerning a

  proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion and will not

  disturb the ruling unless it is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or

  unfair. Id.

¶ 12   When a defendant objects to the trial court’s ruling on a jury

  instruction, we review for nonconstitutional harmless error and will

  thus affirm if “there is not a reasonable probability that the error

  contributed to the defendant’s conviction.” People v. Garcia, 28

  P.3d 340, 344 (Colo. 2001) (quoting Salcedo v. People, 999 P.2d

  833, 841 (Colo. 2000)).

                            C. Applicable Law

¶ 13   “[A]n instruction embodying a defendant’s theory of the case

  must be given by the trial court if the record contains any evidence

  to support the theory.” People v. Nunez, 841 P.2d 261, 264 (Colo.

  1992). Moreover, a trial court has “an affirmative obligation” to

  work with counsel to correct a tendered theory of the case

  instruction “or to incorporate the substance of such in an

  instruction drafted by the court.” Id. at 265; see also People v.

  Tippett, 733 P.2d 1183, 1195 (Colo. 1987) (a trial court may refuse

  to give an instruction already embodied in other instructions).


                                     5
¶ 14   In considering whether a jury was adequately informed of a

  defendant’s theory of the case, a reviewing court can take into

  account whether defense counsel’s closing argument “fairly

  represented” the theory to the jury. People v. Dore, 997 P.2d 1214,

  1222 (Colo. App. 1999).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 15   Trujillo contends that the trial court abused its discretion in

  rejecting the tendered instructions. We disagree.

¶ 16   Trujillo asserts that the tendered instructions were essential

  because they communicated his theory of the case. However, the

  trial court instructed the jury on his theory of the case in an

  instruction that clearly stated that he believed the property he took

  from the house was “his sole property.” To the extent that the trial

  court had a duty to work with the defense in crafting a proper

  theory of defense instruction, we conclude that the trial court

  fulfilled that duty here by giving an alternative theory of the case

  instruction that encompassed Trujillo’s tendered instructions. See

  Nunez, 841 P.2d at 265 n.9. Moreover, the trial court specifically

  stated that defense counsel would be allowed to incorporate the




                                     6
  property law concepts into her closing argument, which defense

  counsel did.

¶ 17   Trujillo asserts that the instructions he tendered were

  accurate statements of property law. In contrast, the People argue

  that the instructions misstated the law as it applies in criminal

  prosecutions for theft and criminal mischief. Because we conclude

  that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in drafting a theory

  of defense instruction that encompassed the defense’s tendered

  instructions, we do not address whether the rejected instructions

  were accurate statements of the law.

¶ 18   The jury instructions, as a whole, “fairly and adequately

  cover[ed] the issues presented.” People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169, 183

  (Colo. App. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not

  abuse its discretion in rejecting in part the defense-tendered jury

  instructions.

                    III. Evidence of Prior Foreclosure

¶ 19   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the

  People to introduce evidence that another property of his had been

  foreclosed. We disagree.




                                     7
                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 20   Before trial, Trujillo filed a motion to exclude evidence of other

  acts or res gestae evidence. Trujillo’s motion addressed several

  categories of other acts evidence, including evidence related to any

  “financial and/or legal problems” unrelated to the charged offenses.

  During a motions hearing, the People stated that they did not

  intend to introduce any other acts or res gestae evidence. In a

  written ruling, the trial court granted Trujillo’s motion to exclude

  evidence of his unrelated financial and legal problems “unless the

  prosecution fe[lt] that the ‘door ha[d] been opened.’” The trial court

  further ordered that, if the People felt Trujillo introduced evidence of

  his other financial and legal problems, the People could request a

  bench conference during trial.

¶ 21   On the first day of trial, defense counsel stated that she was

  withdrawing her motion to exclude other acts evidence insofar as it

  pertained to evidence of Trujillo’s bankruptcy proceedings. During

  her opening statement, defense counsel then mentioned those

  proceedings.

¶ 22   Later, the People called the bank’s former vice president as an

  expert witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked


                                     8
  the witness why the bank had declined to restructure Trujillo’s

  loan. The prosecutor also asked about Trujillo’s demeanor during

  interactions with the bank. Trujillo objected. After a bench

  conference, the trial court allowed the witness to testify on both

  matters.

¶ 23   Specifically, the witness testified that, during a conversation

  about restructuring the loan, Trujillo “seemed like he was very

  upset.” The witness recalled, “He got into [that] he had a piece of

  property that [another bank] had foreclosed on and it sounded like

  they had sold it for what [Trujillo] believed was a lot less, leaving

  him a large deficiency balance.”

¶ 24   During closing argument, the People alluded to the witness’s

  testimony and referred several times to Trujillo’s general animosity

  against banks.

                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 25   We review a trial court’s decision to admit other acts or res

  gestae evidence for an abuse of discretion. People v. Jimenez, 217

  P.3d 841, 846 (Colo. App. 2008). A court abuses its discretion if its

  decision to admit such evidence is manifestly arbitrary,

  unreasonable, or unfair. Id.


                                      9
¶ 26   We review a preserved claim of nonconstitutional error for

  harmless error, reversing only if any error “substantially influenced

  the verdict or affected the fairness of the trial proceedings.” Hagos

  v. People, 2012 CO 63, ¶ 12, 288 P.3d 116, 119 (quoting Tevlin v.

  People, 715 P.2d 338, 342 (Colo. 1986)).

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 27   Evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the

  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of

  the action more probable or less probable than it would be without

  the evidence.” CRE 401. Generally speaking, “[t]he Colorado Rules

  of Evidence strongly favor the admission of relevant evidence.”

  People v. Brown, 2014 COA 155M-2, ¶ 22, 360 P.3d 167, 172.

  However, relevant evidence is nevertheless inadmissible when “its

  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair

  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.” CRE

  403. Similarly, evidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” is

  inadmissible to prove a person’s character “in order to show that he

  acted in conformity therewith,” though it may be admissible for

  other purposes, including proving intent. CRE 404(b).




                                    10
¶ 28   “Res gestae is a theory of relevance which recognizes that

  certain evidence is relevant because of its unique relationship to the

  charged crime.” People v. Greenlee, 200 P.3d 363, 368 (Colo. 2009).

  However, “there is no need to consider an alternative theory of

  relevance, such as res gestae, where the evidence is admissible

  under general rules of relevancy.” Id.

                               D. Analysis

¶ 29   Trujillo contends that the evidence of the prior foreclosure

  action portrayed him as a “serial defaulter” and was impermissible

  under CRE 404(b) and 403. The People assert that the evidence

  was admissible as “directly relevant” to Trujillo’s intent and motive.

  In the alternative, the People argue that the evidence was res gestae

  evidence. We agree with the People’s first argument that the

  evidence was admissible under CRE 401, and was not barred by

  CRE 403.1



  1 During the bench conference, the trial court allowed the bank’s
  former vice president to testify after conducting an abbreviated CRE
  404(b) analysis that did not specifically address the four-factor test
  set forth in People v. Spoto, 795 P.2d 1314, 1318 (Colo. 1990). The
  trial court did not admit the evidence under the res gestae doctrine.
  However, we can affirm a trial court’s evidentiary ruling on any
  ground supported by the record, “even if that ground was not

                                    11
¶ 30   The evidence of the prior foreclosure was probative of the

  interactions between Trujillo and the bank — it made it more

  probable that Trujillo had the requisite intent to commit theft. It

  was therefore relevant under CRE 401. Further, the risk of unfair

  prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the

  evidence, especially where the prior foreclosure was referenced only

  in passing and the details of that foreclosure were not revealed.

  Thus, the evidence was not barred by CRE 403.

¶ 31   Because we conclude that the evidence of the prior foreclosure

  was relevant under CRE 401 and admissible under CRE 403, we

  need not address whether the evidence was res gestae evidence or

  “other acts” evidence under CRE 404(b). See Greenlee, 200 P.3d at

  368-69. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in

  allowing the testimony concerning the prior foreclosure action.

                      IV. Prosecutorial Misconduct

¶ 32   Trujillo argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on

  the district attorney’s screening process for bringing charges and




  articulated or considered by the trial court.” People v. Phillips, 2012
  COA 176, ¶ 63, 315 P.3d 136, 153.

                                    12
  Trujillo’s right not to testify, and improperly denigrated defense

  counsel. We perceive no basis for reversal.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 33   During redirect examination of one of the People’s expert

  witnesses, an attorney who worked at the bank, the prosecutor

  asked whether the bank played a role in charging Trujillo. The

  prosecutor asked if the witness himself made the decision to file a

  criminal case, to which the witness replied, “No.” The prosecutor

  then asked, “[W]ho is it, according to your understanding, that

  makes those decisions on whether a case gets filed criminally?” The

  witness responded, “A complaint’s made to a police department or

  sheriff’s department and they make that decision in conjunction

  with I believe you.” The prosecutor clarified that “you” meant the

  district attorney’s office. The defense did not object.

¶ 34   During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor said,

             Did you hear all that? [Defense counsel]’s
             talking about all of this stuff, about what
             Trujillo’s intent was. And then did you hear
             her towards the end what she did? She says,
             and correct – this part was correct of what she
             said. My job is to prove intent, right. That is
             my burden. And she’s absolutely right. The
             Defendant has every right to remain silent,



                                    13
            and he exercised that right and that is
            something that you cannot use against him.

            But it is completely ridiculous for [defense
            counsel] to get up here and say that [Trujillo]
            didn’t testify to what his intent was and then
            to go on and talk about what his intent
            actually was. We don’t know what his intent
            was because he never testified to that, which
            he has every right to do. But did you hear
            her? She’s up here saying his intent was this.

¶ 35   Trujillo objected on the basis that the prosecutor was

  denigrating defense counsel. The trial court sustained the objection

  as to the prosecutor’s tone, but overruled it as to content. The

  prosecutor then argued, “[I]f you go out and run somebody over and

  – and think that you had the right to do that, is that gonna be a

  legitimate defense by saying, well, I thought I could do that. I didn’t

  – nobody ever told me. Nobody put it in writing. When I bought my

  car, in the instruction manual, nothing said that about that. That’s

  preposterous.” Trujillo did not renew his objection.

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 36   In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, an appellate

  court engages in a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether

  the prosecutor’s conduct was improper based on the totality of the

  circumstances. Wend v. People, 235 P.3d 1089, 1096 (Colo. 2010).


                                    14
  Second, we determine whether any misconduct warrants reversal

  under the proper standard of review. Id.

¶ 37   When the alleged misconduct is objected to at trial and is of

  constitutional magnitude, we review for constitutional harmless

  error. Id. When the alleged misconduct is not of a constitutional

  magnitude, and when the defense objected at trial, we subject the

  prosecutorial misconduct to harmless error review. Id. at 1097.

  Such prosecutorial misconduct will be considered harmless

  “whenever there is no reasonable probability that it contributed to

  the defendant’s conviction.” Crider v. People, 186 P.3d 39, 42 (Colo.

  2008). When the defense did not object to the misconduct, we

  review for plain error. Wend, 235 P.3d at 1097-98.

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 38   A prosecutor cannot comment on a “screening process” for

  charging cases “because it both hints that additional evidence

  supporting guilt exists and reveals the personal opinion of the

  prosecutor.” Domingo-Gomez v. People, 125 P.3d 1043, 1052 (Colo.

  2005). It is also improper for a prosecutor to make remarks “for the

  obvious purpose of denigrating defense counsel.” People v. Jones,

  832 P.2d 1036, 1038 (Colo. App. 1991). It is similarly improper for


                                   15
  a prosecutor to comment on a defendant’s decision not to testify.

  Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965); see also People v.

  Martinez, 652 P.2d 174, 177 (Colo. App. 1981) (noting that a

  prosecutor’s comment on a defendant’s silence constitutes

  reversible error when “the prosecution argued that such silence

  constituted an implied admission of guilt”).

¶ 39   Nevertheless, “[a] prosecutor is allowed considerable latitude

  in responding to the argument made by opposing counsel.” People

  v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1211 (Colo. App. 1999), aff’d, 43 P.3d

  611 (Colo. 2001). Further, “[a]lthough it is improper for a

  prosecutor to assert that opposing counsel knows that the

  accused’s case is not meritorious,” the prosecutor may permissibly

  argue “that the evidence in support of defendant’s innocence lacked

  substance.” Id. at 1211; see also People v. Samson, 2012 COA 167,

  ¶ 31, 302 P.3d 311, 317 (stating that a prosecutor may permissibly

  “comment on the absence of evidence to support a defendant’s

  contentions”).

¶ 40   Appellate courts consider several factors in determining

  whether prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial, including the

  nature of the error, the pervasiveness of the misconduct, the


                                    16
  context, and the overall strength of the evidence supporting the

  conviction. People v. McBride, 228 P.3d 216, 225 (Colo. App. 2009);

  see also Crider, 186 P.3d at 43. For example, a reviewing court may

  consider whether proper jury instructions mitigated the prejudicial

  effect of prosecutorial misconduct. See People v. Castillo, 2014 COA

  140M, ¶ 78, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (concluding prosecutor’s

  misstatements were harmless in light of instructions from the trial

  court and the defense’s closing argument) (cert. granted in part Nov.

  23, 2015).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 41   Trujillo contends that three instances of prosecutorial

  misconduct require reversal. We disagree.

¶ 42   Trujillo first contends that the prosecutor improperly referred

  to a screening process while examining the expert witness. We

  perceive no prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor here did not

  imply that he had engaged in a screening process to “weed out the

  weaker cases and, implicitly, that the State d[id] not consider this a

  weak case.” Domingo-Gomez, 125 P.3d at 1052 (concluding the

  prosecutor’s comment that “it takes a lot more than somebody

  saying that person did it” to bring charges was improper). Rather,


                                    17
  the prosecutor clarified that the bank did not bring criminal

  charges and that the witness himself did not stand to gain as a

  result of Trujillo’s conviction. The People assert, and we agree, that

  the prosecutor’s question merely elicited testimony to establish that

  the district attorney’s office was responsible for pursuing the

  criminal charges against Trujillo.

¶ 43   Second, Trujillo asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly

  commented on his decision not to testify. We disagree. Even if we

  assume the comment on Trujillo’s decision not to testify was

  improper, not every comment on a defendant’s choice not to testify

  requires reversal. See Martinez, 652 P.2d at 177. “The determining

  factor is whether the defendant’s silence was used by the

  prosecution as a means of creating an inference of guilt,” id., and

  we conclude that the prosecutor’s comments here did not raise

  such an inference.

¶ 44   Finally, Trujillo contends that the prosecutor impermissibly

  denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of the case

  during rebuttal closing argument. We agree that the prosecutor

  improperly denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of




                                       18
  the case when he characterized her arguments as “completely

  ridiculous” and “preposterous.”

¶ 45   However, we perceive no basis for reversal as a result of these

  improper remarks. The comments were limited to the People’s

  rebuttal closing argument. Moreover, significant evidence

  corroborated the jury’s finding of guilt — specifically, the

  undisputed evidence that Trujillo had removed an extensive amount

  of property from the house. Viewing the record as a whole, we

  cannot say that there was a “reasonable probability” that the

  prosecutor’s remarks denigrating defense counsel contributed to

  Trujillo’s convictions. See Crider, 186 P.3d at 42. Thus, we

  determine the error was harmless.

¶ 46   In sum, though we agree that the prosecutor improperly

  denigrated defense counsel, we perceive no basis for reversal.

                       V. Indeterminate Probation

¶ 47   Trujillo contends that the trial court did not have the statutory

  authority to sentence him to indeterminate probation. We disagree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 48   During the sentencing hearing, the People requested that

  Trujillo be placed on a “long period of probation . . . somewhere in


                                    19
  the neighborhood of eight to ten years” because they anticipated

  that Trujillo would be ordered to pay substantial restitution.2

  Trujillo requested unsupervised probation with a collections

  investigator monitoring his restitution payments.

¶ 49   The trial court imposed an “indefinite probation sentence”

  because of the substantial restitution that Trujillo was expected to

  owe. In imposing an indeterminate probation sentence, the trial

  court stated, “There is case law that talks about whether

  [indeterminate probation] is something that can or should be

  imposed and it’s certainly something that is allowed regardless of

  the type of conviction that has been entered.”

¶ 50   The mittimus states that the sentence imposed was a term of

  probation for seven years to life.

                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 51   The People contend that we should not consider this claim

  because a sentence to probation is not ordinarily subject to



  2 The trial court ultimately ordered Trujillo to pay $171,421.97 in
  restitution. Trujillo separately appealed that order, and a division
  of this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for
  reconsideration. People v. Trujillo, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2486, Oct.
  5, 2017) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)).

                                       20
  appellate review. However, “where, as here, a defendant contends

  that ‘a court has exceeded its statutory authority’ in imposing a

  probationary sentence, appellate review is warranted.” People v.

  Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, ¶ 10, 305 P.3d 420, 423 (quoting People v.

  Rossman, 140 P.3d 172, 174 (Colo. App. 2006)).

¶ 52   “We review sentencing decisions that are within the statutory

  range for an abuse of discretion.” People v. Torrez, 2013 COA 37,

  ¶ 71, 316 P.3d 25, 37. However, where the defendant contends that

  a court exceeded its statutory sentencing authority, our inquiry

  involves statutory interpretation. Jenkins, ¶ 12, 305 P.3d at 423.

  We review such issues of statutory interpretation de novo. Id.

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 53   Under section 18-1.3-202(1)(a), C.R.S. 2017, a trial court “may

  grant the defendant probation for such period and upon such terms

  and conditions as it deems best.” Further, “[t]he length of probation

  shall be subject to the discretion of the court and may exceed the

  maximum period of incarceration authorized for the classification of

  the offense of which the defendant is convicted.” Id.

¶ 54   In Jenkins, a division of this court concluded that section 18-

  1.3-202(1) “authorizes a trial court to impose an indeterminate term


                                   21
  of probation.” Jenkins, ¶ 38, 305 P.3d at 426. The Jenkins division

  bolstered its conclusion by looking to the plain language of the

  statute — which the division noted “contemplate[s] both

  determinate and indeterminate terms of probation” — and to the

  provision’s legislative history. Id. at ¶¶ 40, 42, 46, 305 P.3d at 426-

  28. Finally, the division noted that section 18-1.3-202(1) “generally

  pertains to a broad class of cases, and it simply allows a trial court

  to elect an indeterminate term if it sentences an offender who has

  been convicted of a felony to probation.” Id. at ¶ 50, 305 P.3d at

  428 (upholding probationary sentence of ten years to life); see also

  People v. Martinez, 844 P.2d 1203, 1206 (Colo. App. 1992)

  (concluding that a trial court has authority to impose a term of

  probation that exceeds the sentence to imprisonment in the

  statutory aggravated range for an offense).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 55   Trujillo asserts that the trial court exceeded its statutory

  authority in imposing an indeterminate probationary sentence. We

  disagree.

¶ 56   Like the Jenkins division, we conclude that section 18-1.3-

  202(1) gives a trial court the authority to sentence a defendant


                                    22
  convicted of a felony to an indefinite probationary period. Trujillo

  urges that the statute limits a trial court’s authority to impose an

  indeterminate probation sentence. Under Trujillo’s logic, a sentence

  to probation for 100 years is permissible, but an indeterminate

  probation sentence is outside the trial court’s statutory authority.

  The statute offers no basis for reaching this conclusion.

¶ 57   Trujillo asserts that Jenkins is distinguishable because that

  case concerned whether a defendant convicted of a sex offense not

  falling under the supervision scheme of the Colorado Sex Offender

  Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998 (SOLSA), see §§ 18-1.3-1001

  to -1012, C.R.S. 2017, could nevertheless be sentenced to

  indeterminate probation. Jenkins, ¶ 1, 305 P.3d at 422. Trujillo

  contends that Jenkins was limited to the particular circumstances

  of that case, and does not widely apply to all offenses and

  defendants. However, the Jenkins division made clear that section

  18-1.3-202(1) “establishes a general rule as far as the possibility of

  an indeterminate probationary term for felonies” and “authorizes a

  trial court to impose an indeterminate term of probation.” Id. at

  ¶¶ 38, 50, 305 P.3d at 426, 428. In fact, Jenkins explicitly rejected

  the argument that a sentence of indeterminate probation could be


                                    23
  imposed only in sex offense cases subject to SOLSA. Id. at ¶¶ 49-

  50, 305 P.3d at 428. Thus, Trujillo’s argument that Jenkins is

  limited to sex offenses is unavailing.

¶ 58   In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its

  statutory authority in imposing the probation sentence here.

                         VI. Costs of Prosecution

¶ 59   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in awarding the

  full costs of prosecution requested by the People without making a

  finding on whether any portion of the costs was attributable to the

  charge on which he was acquitted. We agree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 60   Before sentencing, the People moved for reimbursement of the

  costs of prosecution pursuant to section 18-1.3-701, C.R.S. 2017.

  The People requested $768.70. Trujillo opposed the motion on the

  basis that the People bore responsibility for the costs incurred to

  prove the defrauding a secured creditor charge, of which Trujillo

  was acquitted.

¶ 61   During the sentencing hearing, the trial court awarded the

  requested costs of prosecution, ordering Trujillo to pay $768.70.




                                    24
                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 62   The trial court, in its discretion, may assess reasonable and

  necessary costs of prosecution against a convicted defendant. See

  § 18-1.3-701(2)(j.5). Thus, we review an assessment of costs of

  prosecution for an abuse of discretion, reversing if the trial court’s

  determination is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair,

  People v. Palomo, 272 P.3d 1106, 1110 (Colo. App. 2011), or if the

  trial court misapplied the law, People v. Jefferson, 2017 CO 35,

  ¶ 25, 393 P.3d 493, 499.

                             C. Applicable Law

¶ 63   Under section 16-18-101(1), C.R.S. 2017, the state bears the

  costs of prosecution when a defendant is acquitted. Such costs

  may include witness fees, mileage, lodging expenses, transportation

  costs, and other reasonable and necessary costs that directly result

  from prosecuting the defendant. § 18-1.3-701(2); see also People v.

  Sinovcic, 2013 COA 38, ¶¶ 15-16, 304 P.3d 1176, 1179. If a

  defendant is convicted of fewer than all of the charged counts, the

  court may assess only those costs attributable to the counts for

  which the defendant was convicted, if an allocation is practicable.

  Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1112.


                                    25
                               D. Analysis

¶ 64   Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in not making a

  finding as to whether some portion of the requested costs of

  prosecution were allocable to the acquitted charge. We agree.

¶ 65   As Trujillo concedes, it is possible that the costs cannot be

  allocated between the charge on which he was acquitted and the

  two charges on which he was convicted. However, the trial court

  did not find that such an allocation was impracticable. Because the

  trial court was required to consider whether some portion of the

  requested costs was practicably attributable to the acquitted

  charge, the trial court abused its discretion. See DeBella v. People,

  233 P.3d 664, 667 (Colo. 2010) (failure to exercise discretion

  constitutes an abuse of the court’s discretion).

¶ 66   Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding the People costs of

  prosecution and remand for the trial court to make appropriate

  findings of fact and “assess only those costs that are related to the

  prosecution of the . . . counts of which [Trujillo] was convicted, to

  the extent an allocation is practicable.” Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1113.




                                    26
                    VII. Amendment to Theft Statute

¶ 67   Trujillo contends that he should have benefited from an

  amendment to the theft statute reclassifying theft between $20,000

  and $100,000 as a class 4 felony. We agree.

                            A. Additional Facts

¶ 68   The General Assembly amended the theft statute on June 5,

  2013. See Ch. 373, sec. 1, § 18-4-401, 2013 Colo. Sess. Laws

  2196. Under the amended statute, theft between $20,000 and

  $100,000 constitutes a class 4 felony. See § 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S.

  2017. Prior to the amendment, theft over $20,000 constituted a

  class 3 felony. § 18-4-401(2)(d), C.R.S. 2011.

¶ 69   Trujillo was charged with theft of $20,000 or more in April

  2011. He was convicted in October 2013 and sentenced in

  December 2013. His theft conviction was recorded on the mittimus

  as a class 3 felony.

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 70   The People assert that, because Trujillo did not make this

  argument before the trial court, we should review only for plain

  error. However, the division in People v. Stellabotte rejected this

  argument. 2016 COA 106, ¶ 42, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (noting that plain


                                    27
  error review was inappropriate because “a defendant may raise a

  claim at any time that his or her sentence was not authorized by

  law”) (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Following Stellabotte, we review

  the legality of the sentence de novo. Id. at ¶ 4, ___ P.3d at ___.

                             C. Applicable Law

¶ 71   In determining whether to apply amendments to legislation,

  we first look to the plain language of the statute. People v.

  Summers, 208 P.3d 251, 253-54 (Colo. 2009). If a statute explicitly

  states that it applies only to offenses committed after the effective

  date, it must be applied accordingly. See People v. McCoy, 764 P.2d

  1171, 1174 (Colo. 1988).

¶ 72   As a general rule, “[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in

  its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S. 2017. However, if a statute is

  silent as to whether it applies only prospectively, a defendant may

  seek retroactive application if he or she benefits from a significant

  change in the law. § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017; see also People

  v. Thornton, 187 Colo. 202, 203, 529 P.2d 628, 628 (1974) (allowing

  defendant to seek relief on direct appeal under statute).

¶ 73   In Stellabotte, a division of this court concluded that the

  amendatory theft legislation “applies retroactively to cases pending


                                    28
  in the trial court when the amendment was enacted.” Stellabotte,

  ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___; People v. Patton, 2016 COA 187, ¶ 32, ___ P.3d

  ___, ___; see also People v. Patton, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2359, Aug.

  11, 2016) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)) (cert. granted

  Feb. 6, 2017).

                                D. Analysis

¶ 74   Trujillo contends that the amendment to the theft statute

  requires that we vacate his sentence and remand for the trial court

  to enter his theft conviction as a class 4 felony. We agree.

¶ 75   As the division noted in Stellabotte, the theft amendment does

  not explicitly state that it is either retroactive or prospective.

  Stellabotte, ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___. In the face of this legislative

  silence, the division held that a defendant who committed theft

  prior to the statutory amendment but was not convicted until after

  its passage was entitled to the benefit retroactively. See id. at

  ¶¶ 39, 45, ___ P.3d at ___. The same is true here.

¶ 76   Trujillo was charged with theft before the statute was

  amended, but was not convicted or sentenced until after the

  General Assembly lowered the classification for theft between




                                      29
  $20,000 and $100,000.3 Thus, like the defendant in Stellabotte,

  Trujillo is entitled to the benefit of the amendment. As a result, we

  vacate the sentence for the theft conviction and remand for the

  conviction to be entered as a class 4 felony.

¶ 77   The partial dissent looks to several statutory provisions in

  support of its conclusion that Trujillo is not entitled to the benefit of

  the amendatory legislation. First, the partial dissent cites section

  2-4-202, which states the general presumption that statutes apply

  prospectively. However, as the division noted in Stellabotte, section

  18-1-410 is a specific exception to the general rule expressed in

  section 2-4-202. Stellabotte, ¶ 47 n.4, ___ P.3d at ___ n.4. We

  agree with that analysis. Thus, the general presumption that

  statutes apply prospectively does not apply here where Trujillo

  seeks the benefit of a “significant change in the law, . . . allowing in




  3 Trujillo asserts that the theft was between $20,000 and $100,000
  based on testimony from trial. The People do not contest the value
  of the stolen property in this case. We therefore assume that
  Trujillo’s offense properly fell within the value range set forth in
  section 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S. 2017.

                                     30
  the interests of justice retroactive application of the changed legal

  standard.”4 § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).

¶ 78   The partial dissent also invokes section 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017,

  in support of its conclusion. Section 2-4-303 states:

             The repeal, revision, amendment, or
             consolidation of any statute or part of a statute
             or section or part of a section of any statute
             shall not have the effect to release, extinguish,
             alter, modify, or change in whole or in part any
             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, either civil or
             criminal, which shall have been incurred
             under such statute, unless the repealing,
             revising, amending, or consolidating act so
             expressly provides.

¶ 79   However, the supreme court has noted that the “general

  saving” provision codified in this statute is not applicable to

  criminal cases; instead, the court noted in dictum that it “has


  4 The partial dissent also asserts that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I),
  C.R.S. 2017, does not provide any relief to Trujillo because that
  provision requires that “there has been significant change in the
  law, applied to the [defendant’s] conviction or sentence.” The
  partial dissent asserts that the phrase “applied to” requires that the
  legislation expressly state that it applies retroactively. We disagree
  with that interpretation, and believe that our view finds authority in
  supreme court case law. See People v. Thomas, 185 Colo. 395, 397,
  525 P.2d 1136, 1137 (1974) (noting that “[t]he legislature intended
  the changed legal standards to apply wherever constitutionally
  permissible” but making no mention of whether the amendatory
  legislation reclassifying attempted second degree burglary explicitly
  stated that it applied retroactively).

                                     31
  consistently adhered to the principle . . . that a defendant is entitled

  to the benefits of amendatory legislation when relief is sought before

  finality has attached to the judgment of conviction.” Noe v. Dolan,

  197 Colo. 32, 36 n.3, 589 P.2d 483, 486 n.3 (1979).

¶ 80   In People v. Boyd, a division of the court of appeals concluded

  that section 2-4-303 did not prevent the retroactive effect of an

  amendatory constitutional provision. 2015 COA 109, ¶ 27, 395

  P.3d 1128, 1134, aff’d, 2017 CO 2, 387 P.3d 755.5 The division

  noted the supreme court’s language in Noe. Id. at ¶ 28, 395 P.3d at

  1134. To the extent that other supreme court cases included

  contrary statements, the Boyd division concluded that such

  statements were dicta and that the supreme court had not

  overruled or disapproved of either Noe or People v. Thomas, 185

  Colo. 395, 398, 525 P.2d 1136, 1138 (1974) (holding that

  “amendatory legislation mitigating the penalties for crimes should

  be applied to any case which has not received final judgment”).



  5 The supreme court in Boyd affirmed the Court of Appeals decision
  on different grounds, concluding that the marijuana criminal
  offense statute had been rendered inoperative by Amendment 64.
  Neither the majority nor the dissent in Boyd cited section 2-4-303,
  C.R.S. 2017.

                                    32
  Boyd, ¶¶ 29-30, 395 P.3d at 1134-35. Finally, the Boyd division

  concluded that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) controls over section 2-4-

  303 because the former sets forth a specific exception to the latter,

  which codifies a “general rule[] of construction regarding

  prospective effect for amendatory legislation.” Id. at ¶¶ 31-32, 395

  P.3d at 1135. We agree with the Boyd division’s analysis and

  therefore do not perceive section 2-4-303 as a bar to the relief

  Trujillo seeks.

¶ 81   In making its statutory arguments, the partial dissent relies

  on the plain meaning of both section 2-4-303 and section 18-1-

  410(1)(f)(I). However, as discussed, the supreme court has not

  given either provision its plain meaning. Despite express reference

  in section 2-4-303 to civil and criminal penalties, the supreme court

  has indicated that the provision does not apply to criminal cases.

  Noe, 197 Colo. at 36 n.3, 589 P.2d at 486 n.3. Similarly, while

  section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) by its express terms applies to defendants

  seeking postconviction relief, the supreme court has held that the

  statute also extends to defendants seeking relief on direct appeal.

  Thornton, 187 Colo. at 203, 529 P.2d at 628. In light of the




                                    33
  supreme court’s interpretation of these statutes, we cannot give

  them the meanings that the partial dissent ascribes to them.

¶ 82   Finally, the partial dissent also relies on Riley v. People, in

  which the supreme court noted that it has “emphasized that a

  defendant is not entitled to the ameliorative effects of amendatory

  legislation if the General Assembly has not clearly indicated its

  intent to require such retroactive application.” 828 P.2d 254, 258

  (Colo. 1992). However, we do not consider this statement to have

  the controlling effect the partial dissent gives it. In Riley, the

  defendant committed a crime in April 1988 and sought relief under

  two sentencing provisions that expressly stated they applied to acts

  “committed on or after” July 1, 1988. Id. at 255-56. The Riley

  court held the defendant there was not entitled to relief because

  applying the statutes retroactively would require the court to ignore

  the “clear legislative determination” that the amended sentencing

  provisions would apply only to acts after that date. Id. at 257.

¶ 83   Thus, Riley is readily distinguishable from the present case,

  where the amendments to the theft statute do not expressly provide

  an effective date, and the language relied on by the partial dissent is

  dicta. Accord McCoy, 764 P.2d at 1174 (noting that, where


                                     34
  legislation expressly stated it applied to acts committed on or after

  its effective date, a “defendant does not receive any ameliorative

  benefit” because “retroactive application of the amendatory

  legislation is clearly not intended by its own terms”); People v.

  Macias, 631 P.2d 584, 587 (Colo. 1981) (same).

¶ 84   Thus, we conclude, in accordance with Stellabotte, that Trujillo

  should receive the benefit of the amendment to the theft statute

  reclassifying theft between $20,000 and $100,000 as a class 4

  felony. See Stellabotte, ¶ 40, ___ P.3d at ___.

                               VIII. Conclusion

¶ 85   Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The

  sentence is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is

  remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views

  expressed in this opinion.

       JUDGE RICHMAN concurs.

       JUDGE FURMAN concurs in part and dissents in part.




                                     35
          JUDGE FURMAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

¶ 86      I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion only as to the

  effect of the 2013 amendments to the theft statute. I conclude that

  the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively

  to Trujillo’s case. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.

¶ 87      First, the General Assembly has made it clear that a “statute is

  presumed to be prospective in its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S.

  2017. The 2013 amendments to the theft statute are silent as to

  whether they apply prospectively or retroactively. Therefore, I

  presume that the 2013 amendments are prospective in operation

  and do not apply to Trujillo’s offense, which occurred before 2013.

  See id.

¶ 88      Second, an amendment to a criminal statute does not change

  the penalty for crimes already committed under the statute unless

  the amendatory legislation expressly provides for such a change.

  See § 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017. Section 2-4-303 provides, in relevant

  part:

               The . . . amendment . . . of any statute or part
               of a statute . . . shall not have the effect to
               release, extinguish, alter, modify, or change in
               whole or in part any penalty, forfeiture, or
               liability, either civil or criminal, which shall


                                      36
             have been incurred under such statute, unless
             the . . . amending . . . act so expressly
             provides, and such statute or part of a statute
             . . . so . . . amended . . . shall be treated and
             held as still remaining in force for the purpose
             of sustaining any and all proper actions, suits,
             proceedings, and prosecutions, criminal as
             well as civil, for the enforcement of such
             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, as well as for
             the purpose of sustaining any judgment,
             decree, or order which can or may be rendered,
             entered, or made in such actions, suits,
             proceedings, or prosecutions imposing,
             inflicting, or declaring such penalty, forfeiture,
             or liability.

  Because the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not expressly

  provide that they apply retroactively, and Trujillo committed his

  crime before 2013, he is liable for theft as it was defined when he

  committed the offense. See id.

¶ 89   Third, in Riley v. People, 828 P.2d 254, 258 (Colo. 1992), our

  supreme court “emphasized that a defendant is not entitled to the

  ameliorative effects of amendatory legislation if the General

  Assembly has not clearly indicated its intent to require such

  retroactive application.” Id. I consider this statement by the

  supreme court about its own jurisprudence on this issue to be

  controlling.




                                    37
¶ 90   Fourth, section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017, does not allow

  Trujillo, on direct appeal, to seek retroactive application of the 2013

  amendments to his case. Section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) allows a

  defendant to seek retroactive application of a “significant change in

  the law, applied to” a defendant’s “conviction or sentence.” I believe

  that the phrase “applied to” reflects the General Assembly’s intent

  that, for amendatory legislation to apply retroactively to a

  defendant’s conviction or sentence, the legislation must state that it

  applies retroactively. Thus, because, as noted, the 2013

  amendments do not state that they apply retroactively to Trujillo’s

  conviction and sentence, he may not seek retroactive application

  under section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).

¶ 91   Finally, and with all due respect, I decline to follow People v.

  Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106 (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Indeed, I

  agree with Judge Dailey’s dissent in Stellabotte. See id. at ¶¶ 62-70

  (Dailey, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I have a random question. If I were to do a sql select and while the sql server was querying my request someone else does a insert statement... could that data that was inputted in that insert statement also be retrieved from my select statement?

A:

Queries are queued, so if the SELECT occurs before the INSERT there's no possibility of seeing the newly inserted data.
Using default isolation levels, SELECT is generally given higher privilege over others but still only reads COMMITTED data.  So if the INSERT data has not been committed by the time the SELECT occurs--again, you wouldn't see the newly inserted data.  If the INSERT has been committed, the subsequent SELECT will include the newly inserted data.
If the isolation level allowed reading UNCOMMITTED (AKA dirty) data, then yes--a SELECT occurring after the INSERT but before the INSERT data was committed would return that data.  This is not recommended practice, because UNCOMMITTED data could be subject to a ROLLBACK.

============

Infliximab (IFX), a chimeric anti-TNFα antibody, is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in a considerable proportion of IBD patients refractory to any other treatments \[[@ref1],[@ref2]\]. However, 8-12% of adult and/or pediatric patients fail to respond to the induction regimen (known as primary non responders) and approximately 40% of patients who respond initially and achieve clinical remission inevitably lose response over time\[[@ref3],[@ref7]\]. Lack of response to IFX is a stable trait and suggests that the differences in response might be in part genetically determined. Considering the high cost and safety profile of this drug, genetic targeting of patients responding to this therapy is certainly of great interest \[[@ref8]\]. So far, limited candidate gene association studies with response to IFX have been reported \[[@ref9]-[@ref11]\]. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in paediatric IBD patients has revealed that the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci were associated with primary non response \[[@ref12]\]. Furthermore, although TNFa gene is of great interest as a candidate gene for pharmacogenetic approaches few studies have been performed to date and some have led to contradictory results \[[@ref10],[@ref11],[@ref13]-[@ref15]\].

All anti-TNF agents share an IgG1 Fc fragment, but the contribution of the Fc portion to the response to treatment among currently used TNF blockers remains unknown. Receptors for IgG-Fc portion (FcR) are important regulatory molecules of inflammatory responses. FcR polymorphisms alter receptor function by enhancing or diminishing the affinity for immunoglobulins \[[@ref16]\]. Three major classes of FcR that are capable of binding IgG antibodies are recognised: FcγRΙ (CD64), FcγRΙΙ (CD32), and FcγRΙΙΙ (CD16). FcγRΙΙ and FcγRΙΙΙ have multiple isoforms (FcγRΙΙΙA/C and B; FcγRΙΙΙA and B) \[[@ref16]\]. The most frequent polymorphism of *FcγRΙΙΙA* is a point mutation affecting amino acids in codon 158 in the extracellular domain. This results in either a valine (V158) or a phenylalanine (F158) at this position. Recently, it has been reported that CD patients with *FcγRΙΙΙA* -158V/V genotype had a better biological and possibly better clinical response to IFX \[[@ref17]\]. However, further studies did not confirm this observation \[[@ref18]\].

The aim of this study was to assess whether the *TNF* and/ or *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene polymorphisms are genetic predictors of response to IFX, in a cohort of Greek patients with adult or paediatric onset of CD.

Patients - Methods {#sec1-2}
==================

Patients {#sec2-1}
--------

We enrolled 106 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CD attending the outpatient IBD Clinic at the 1^st^ Department of Gastroenterology, "Evangelismos" Hospital (79 adults) or the 1^st^ Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Athens "Aghia Sophia"(27 children). The diagnosis of CD was based on standard clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological criteria \[[@ref1],[@ref19]\]. Eligible patients should have inflammatory (luminal) disease and be naive to IFX.

IFX was administered intravenously at a dose of 5mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks. Clinical and serological responses were assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) \[[@ref20]\] and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively, at baseline (before the 1st infusion of IFX), the day before each subsequent IFX infusion and after 12 weeks of treatment. Ileocolonoscopy was performed by a single endoscopist (GJM) at baseline and after 12-20 weeks of therapy to assess mucosal healing. Any changes in endoscopic appearance compared to baseline endoscopy were classified in four categories \[[@ref21],[@ref22]\] \[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}\]. Patients were classified in accordance to response to IFX therapy as shown in [table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}. The ethical committee of the participating hospitals approved the study. Research was carried out according to Helsinki Convention (1975) and written inform consent was obtained in advance from each patient.

Genotyping {#sec2-2}
----------

Genomic DNA from whole blood containing EDTA was extracted using standard techniques (NucleoSpin Blood kit, Macherey-Nagel, Germany). All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were run under conditions previously described \[[@ref23]\]. Primer sequences for the gene polymorphism at --308 were forward 5′-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3′, for the polymorphism at −238 forward 5′-ATC TGG AGG AAG CGG TAG TG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGA AGA CCC CCC TCG GAA CC-3′. The PCR products were digested at 37 °C with NcoI to detect the SNP in the −308 gene allele and MspI to detect the polymorphism of the −238 nucleotide. The -857 C/T polymorphism was analyzed by allele-specific PCR method24 using the primers TNF857-C: 5′-aag gat aag ggc tca gag ag-3′, TNF857-N: 5′-cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc g-3′ and TNF857-M: 5′-t cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc a-3′. The --158V/F polymorphism of FcγRΙΙΙA gene was detected as described by Leppers-van de Straat et al \[[@ref25]\] using the primers 5′-CTG AAG ACA CAT TTT TACT CC CAA (A/C)-3′ and 5′-TCC AAA AGC CAC ACT CAA AGA C-3′. The PCR products were then subjected to 3% agarose-gel electrophoresis. "No target" controls were included in each PCR batch to ensure that reagents had not been contaminated.

Statistical Analysis {#sec2-3}
--------------------

Genotype frequencies were compared with the chi-square with Yate's correction using S-Plus (v. 6.2Insightful, Seattle, WA). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with GraphPad (v. 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The p values are all two-sided. Correction for multiple testing was not applied in this study. *P* values of \&lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant.

Results {#sec1-3}
=======

Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are given in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}. There were 68 (64.15%) complete responders, 25 (23.58%) partial responders and 13 (12.26%) non responders to IFX in this study. There were no statistical differences in the mean age, gender, disease duration, location and behavior and smoking habits between complete or partial responders and primary non-responders. There was no disagreement between HBI scores and serum CRP levels. Although, the post-treatment CRP levels were significantly lower in complete responders compared to partial and non-responders, the decrease in CRP levels did not differ significantly between the three groups. Post-treatment CRP levels and mean HBI score were significantly lower in complete responders compared to pre-treatment values in contrast to partial and/or non-responders where the CRP levels and the mean HBI score did not differ significantly.

Demographic, clinical and biological characteristics of the study population

![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g003)

The -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms of the TNF gene and the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene were successfully determined in all subjects. The genotype distribution in complete, partial and non-responders were presented in [Table 4](#T4){ref-type="table"}. No significant difference was observed for the polymorphism tested. In addition, although there may be genetic differences in early (paediatric)-onset and late (adult)-onset CD we were unable to detect any such differences although the number of paediatric patients included in the current study did not allow firm conclusions.

Genotype frequency in complete responders, partial responders and non responders

![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g004)

In the present study, we could not correlate the decrease in serum CRP levels with the genotypes tested in any particular group of patients since in most of the cases serum CRP levels dropped by more than 25% after 12 weeks of treatment. However, no significant decrease in CRP was observed between the TNF genotypes tested. Regarding the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene, the relative decrease in serum CRP levels was greatest in VV homozygotes (78.15 ± 33.68%) and lowest in FF homozygotes (69.84 ± 28.7%) but this difference was not significant. Due to the small number of cases we did not stratify the genotype frequencies according to age.

Discussion {#sec1-4}
==========

The mechanism of IFX action in IBD seems to be multifactorial and the response to IFX is a complex phenomenon influenced by several parameters \[[@ref1]\]. Interestingly, a certain proportion of patients do not respond to IFX at all whereas a significant proportion will lose response over time \[[@ref3]-[@ref7]\]. This is the first Greek study aiming at identifying any significant associationbetween the -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF gene and the -158V/F polymorphism in *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene and response to IFX in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with CD and it was negative.

Efficacy of IFX was assessed by clinical, serological and endoscopic parameters. Clinical response to IFX was evaluated using the HBI, which has been used in many clinical trials, is simple to use and has shown good correlation with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \[[@ref26]\]. Serological evaluation of response to IFX was based on changes in serum levels of CRP, which has shown a good correlation with clinical activity and to a certain degree with endoscopic activity of CD \[[@ref27]\]. Finally, endoscopic activity of disease was assessed before and after IFX therapy using a simple description of healing of ulcerative and non ulcerative lesions \[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}\] as has been previously described \[[@ref21],[@ref22]\]. Endoscopic healing was assessed after 12-20 weeks of IFX treatment. It is conceivable that 12 weeks may be early to assess mucosal healing induced by biologic therapies \[[@ref27]\] but the vast majority of patients underwent endoscopy at least 16 weeks after initiation of IFX therapy (average time 17.6 weeks) and therefore it is unlikely that we have not obtained an objective view of the intestinal mucosal at follow up ileocolonoscopy.

Regarding the *TNF* genotypes, our results are in agreement with Louis et al \[[@ref11]\] who did not find any significant difference between response groups when genotyped CD patients for the TNF -308G/A polymorphism and compared response rates after IFX treatment. The same results were reported by Mascheretti et al \[[@ref10]\] and Dideberg et al \[[@ref13]\]. Moreover, our results are in agreement with Tomita et al \[[@ref28]\] who reported no significant difference on *TNFa*, *FcgammaRIIA* and *FcgammaRIIIA* between responders and non responders 8 weeks after IFX treatment as well as with results of ACCENT I study where the relative decrease in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment was greatest in -158 VV homozygotes and lowest in FF homozygotes \[[@ref18]\]. In contrast, Louis et al \[[@ref17]\] observed a significant association between the -158V/F polymorphism in *FcγRΙΙΙA* and both the proportion of patients who had a drop in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment and the magnitude in decrease of serum CRP levels. This may account for the relatively small population of patients in our study, genetic differences in the studied populations and/or methodological differences between studies.

Although it would be useful to genetically differentiate 'responders' from 'non-responders', there are not enough data on TNF polymorphisms in IBD and often only selected polymorphisms are genotyped. Small studies have shown possible associations between poor response to IFX and increasing mucosal levels of activated NF-kappaB, homozygosity for the polymorphism in exon 6 of TNFR2 (genotype Arg196Arg), positivity for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and with the presence of increased numbers of activated lamina propia mononuclear cells producing interferon-gamma and TNFa \[[@ref29]\].

In conclusion, our study did not detect any associations between three TNFα gene polymorphisms or the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *FcγRΙΙΙA* gene and response to IFX in CD. However, in view of discrepant results in the literature large-scale pharmacogenetic studies in different populations, with similar baseline disease phenotypes and treatment protocols are needed to adequately estimate associations between genetic polymorphisms and treatment outcomes.
