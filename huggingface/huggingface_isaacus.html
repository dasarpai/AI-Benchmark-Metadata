Effect of section 6\n        (1) To the extent that a national scheme law of this jurisdiction ceases to operate of its own force because of section 6 , the effect is that which would have resulted had this Act and that law been Commonwealth Acts in relation to which the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as in force on 1 November 2000 applied.\n        Note: Part III of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth contains provisions dealing with the effect of repeal of an Act. These provisions protect accrued rights and liabilities and allow legal proceedings in respect of them to be commenced or continued. However, this section and section 9 have the effect of cancelling certain rights and liabilities and terminating certain legal proceedings.\n\n\n            (2) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of Chapter 10 of the new Corporations Act or Part 16 of the new ASIC Act a person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability in substitution for a pre-commencement right or liability, the pre-commencement right or liability is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a right or liability under a law of the State.\n            (3) Despite subsection (1) , a proceeding in a court that –\n                    (a) was started before the relevant time; and\n                    (b) was –\n                            (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                            (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; and\n                    (c) was a proceeding to which section 1383 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 of the new ASIC Act applies at the relevant time; and\n                    (d) had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time –\n            is terminated at the relevant time by force of this subsection.\n            (4) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of a Commonwealth Act (other than the new Corporations Act) referred to in sections 1393 to 1396 of the new Corporations Act a person becomes liable to pay an amount that is the same, and is in respect of the same matter, as an amount (the \&quot;pre-commencement amount\&quot;) that was payable by the person before the relevant time under a provision of the old corporations legislation, the person's liability to pay the pre-commencement amount is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a liability under a law of the State.\n            (5) In subsection (2) ,\n                pre-commencement right or liability means a right or liability, whether civil or criminal, other than a right or liability under an order made by a court before the relevant time or a liability referred to in section 1397(4) of the new Corporations Act, that –\n                        (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under –\n                                (i) a carried-over provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                                (ii) a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation that was no longer in force immediately before the relevant time; and\n                        (b) was in existence immediately before the relevant time.\n            (6) Nothing in this Act revives the co-operative scheme laws or otherwise affects the superseding of those laws by the national scheme laws of this jurisdiction as provided by Division 2 of Part 13 of the old application Act and any regulations made under section 80 of that Act for the purposes of that Division.\n\n    8. Certain provisions of State law taken to operate despite national scheme law\n            (1) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that –\n                    (a) makes (or, if not in force, would make on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction; or\n                    (b) but for the operation of section 5 of the old application Act, would have made (or, if not in force, would have made on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction –\n            is declared by this subsection to have effect despite the provision or provisions of the national scheme law of this jurisdiction with which it is inconsistent and as if the relevant law, or (in the case of a relevant law that is not an Act) the Act under which the relevant law was made, had itself provided expressly for this outcome.\n            Note: Section 5G of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth applies to a provision of a State law that is inconsistent with a provision of the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies if that provision operated, immediately before the commencement of that Act, despite the provision of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision.\n\n\n                (2) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that provides that the whole of a previous State corporations law or a specified provision of a previous State corporations law does not apply to a matter is declared by this subsection to also provide that the whole of the old Corporations Law and the old ASIC Law or the corresponding provision (if any) of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law (as the case requires) does not apply to that matter.\n                Note: Under section 5F(4) of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, if the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC law, or a provision of that Law, did not apply to a matter immediately before the commencement of that Act, then the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies, or the corresponding provision of that legislation, does not apply to the matter.\n\n\n                    (3) Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply to a provision of a relevant law of the State (or a class of provision of relevant laws of the State) specified by the regulations as a provision (or class of provision) to which the subsection does not apply.\n                    (4) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a provision of a relevant law of the State is inconsistent with a provision of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction if it would be inconsistent within the meaning of section 109 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia if the national scheme law were an Act of the Commonwealth.\n                    (5) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 6 of the old application Act in relation to an Act enacted before the commencement of that section or an instrument made under such an Act.\n                    (6) In this section –\n                        matter includes act, omission, body, person or thing;\n                        relevant law of the State means a law of the State enacted or made before the relevant time (whether or not it is in force before that time) other than a national scheme law of this jurisdiction or a previous State corporations law.\n\n            9. Court proceedings and orders\n                    (1) This section applies to a proceeding, whether criminal or civil, in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:\n                            (a) the proceeding was started in a court before the relevant time;\n                            (b) the proceeding was –\n                                    (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                                    (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation;\n                            (c) the proceeding was not a proceeding to which section 1383 or 1384 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 or 268 of the new ASIC Act applies;\n                            (d) the proceeding had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time.\n                    (2) Without limiting section 7(1) but subject to subsection (3) , a proceeding to which this section applies may be continued, and any order made by a court in such a proceeding may be appealed against, reviewed or enforced as if section 6 had not been enacted.\n                    (3) Nothing in this Part, or in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as applying by force of section 7(1) , operates to preserve the effect of an order to which section 1383(5) of the new Corporations Act or section 267(5) of the new ASIC Act applies and, at the relevant time, that order ceases to have effect as an order of the court by which it was made and any proceeding in relation to such an order is terminated by force of this subsection.\n                    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, Part 9 of the old application Act continues to have the same application to a proceeding to which this section applies as it did before the relevant time.\n                    (5) In this section,\n                        proceeding includes –\n                                (a) a proceeding by way of appeal against, or otherwise seeking review of, an order made by a court; and\n                                (b) a proceeding to enforce an order made by a court; and\n                                (c) any other proceeding in respect of a breach of an order made by a court.\n\n            10. Existing rules of court continue to have effect\n                The rules of court made under section 51 of the old application Act and all other enabling powers, as in force immediately before the relevant time, continue to have effect (and may be dealt with) at and after the relevant time as if –\n                        (a) they were rules of court in force under section 23 ; and\n                        (b) they were made for the purposes of the provisions of the corporations legislation (within the meaning of section 23 ) that correspond to the provisions of the old Corporations Law for which they were made.\n\n            11. References to old/new corporations legislation or old/new ASIC legislation\n                    (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) , a reference in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in, an Act, an instrument made under an Act or a law applying as a law of the State by force of an Act to –\n                            (a) a Law, Regulations or instrument of a kind specified in column 1 of the Table in Schedule 1 is taken, at and after the relevant time, to include a reference to the Act, Regulations or instrument of the kind specified opposite it in column 2 of that Table; or\n                            (b) a provision or group of provisions of a Law, Regulations or instrument of a kind specified in column 1 of the Table in Schedule 1 is taken, at and after the relevant time, to include a reference to the corresponding provision or provisions (if any) of the Act, Regulations or instrument of the kind specified opposite it in column 2 of that Table.\n                    (2) The regulations may do either or both of the following:\n                            (a) provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to prescribed references, or references of a prescribed kind –\n                                    (i) in prescribed Acts or instruments made under Acts; or\n                                    (ii) in prescribed laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act; or\n                                    (iii) in Acts, instruments made under Acts, or laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act, of a prescribed kind;\n                            (b) provide that subsection (1) applies in relation to prescribed references, or references of a prescribed kind –\n                                    (i) in prescribed Acts or instruments made under Acts;

were substituted for the words \&quot;to include a reference\&quot;.\n                    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to references in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in –\n                            (a) the old application Act or the applicable provisions (as defined in that Act) of the State; or\n                            (b) a previous State corporations law or an instrument made under such a law; or\n                            (c) this Act or any regulations made under this Act; or\n                            (d) the Corporations (Consequential Amendments) Act 2001 ;

Modifications to applied law\n                    (1) This Part operates to apply a provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State subject to the following modifications:\n                            (a) such modifications as may be specified by or under the law containing the declaratory provision;\n                            (b) a reference to ASIC is (unless a function under an applied law is conferred on ASIC as referred to in section 17 ) taken to be a reference to –\n                                    (i) the Minister administering the declaratory provision or such other person (or person belonging to a class of person) as may be specified by the regulations (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law); or\n                                    (ii) such other person as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision;\n                            (c) a reference to the Gazette is a reference to the Tasmanian Government Gazette;\n                            (d) a reference to the Minister is a reference to the Minister administering the declaratory provision;\n                            (e) a reference to this jurisdiction is a reference to Tasmania;\n                            (f) such other modifications as are necessary or that are prescribed by regulations made under this Act, whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law.\n                    (2) Any power to make regulations under an Act containing a declaratory provision extends to the making of regulations specifying modifications for the purposes of this Part.\n                    (3) Except as provided by subsection (1) , definitions and other interpretation provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of the Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, relevant to the applied law are taken also to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision.\n                    (4) This section has effect subject to sections 17 to 20 .\n\n            17. Conferral of functions on ASIC\n                    (1) Neither a declaratory provision nor an applied law operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to the applied law unless –\n                            (a) the declaratory provision provides for ASIC to perform that function pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of the kind referred to in section 11(8) or (9A)(b) of the new ASIC Act; and\n                            (b) ASIC is authorised to perform that function under section 11 of the new ASIC Act.\n                    (2) If a declaratory provision operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to an applied law, the conferral of that function is taken not to impose a duty to perform that function despite anything to the contrary in the applied law.\n\n            18. Conferral of functions or duties on State courts\n                An applied law that confers a function or duty on a court or on the Court is taken to confer that function or duty (along with the jurisdiction to perform that function or duty) on the Supreme Court or such other court of the State as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision.\n\n            19. Implied application of regulations and other provisions of Corporations legislation\n                    (1) Unless a declaratory provision provides otherwise, the following provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, are also taken to apply to a matter that is the subject of a declaratory provision as if they were laws of the State:\n                            (a) the provisions of any regulations made under the applied law;\n                            (b) any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, that creates an offence in relation to a contravention of the applied law or specifies the penalty for an offence created by a provision of the applied law;\n                            (c) the provisions of Part 9.4B (Civil consequences of contravening civil penalty provisions) of the new Corporations Act for the purposes of any provision of the applied law that is a civil penalty provision within the meaning of that Part.\n                    (2) The regulations may prescribe modifications (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law) of any of the provisions that are also taken to apply to a matter by force of subsection (1) for the purposes of that application.\n\n            20. Proceedings for offences\n                    (1) Proceedings for an offence against an applied law may be dealt with as an offence against a law of the State.\n                    (2) For the purposes of an offence against an applied law –\n                            (a) the amount of a penalty unit specified in relation to that offence by the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, is $100; and\n                            (b) the laws of the State apply in relation to that offence as if the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, were a law or laws of the State.\n                    (3) Without limiting subsection (2)(b) , the laws of the State referred to in that subsection as applying in relation to an offence include laws with respect to –\n                            (a) the investigation and prosecution of offences; and\n                            (b) the arrest, custody, bail, trial, finding of guilt and conviction of persons charged with offences; and\n                            (c) proceedings relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; and\n                            (d) the classification of offences as indictable or summary or indictable triable summarily; and\n                            (e) appeals and reviews relating to criminal proceedings and to proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (c) ; and\n                            (f) the sentencing, punishment and release of persons found guilty or convicted of offences; and\n                            (g) fines, penalties and forfeitures; and\n                            (h) confiscation of the proceeds of crime.\n\n            21. Application of Corporations legislation by other means\n                Nothing in this Part prevents a law of the State from applying any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State otherwise than by means of a declaratory provision.\n\n            PART 4 - General\n\n            22. Power to amend certain statutory rules\n                    (1) The Governor, on the recommendation of the Minister, may make regulations amending a statutory rule made by the Governor in the exercise of a power conferred by any Act.\n                    (2) The Minister may make a recommendation under subsection (1) only if he or she considers that each amendment proposed to be made by the regulations is consequential on the enactment, or the proposed enactment, by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of –\n                            (a) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 ; or\n                            (b) the Corporations Act 1989 ; or\n                            (c) an Act amending an Act referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; or\n                            (d) the new ASIC Act; or\n                            (e) the new Corporations Act.\n                    (3) Part 2 of the Subordinate Legislation Act 1992 does not apply to regulations made under this section.\n                    (4) Nothing in this section prevents a statutory rule from being amended otherwise than by regulations made under this section, including an amendment of a kind referred to in subsection (2) .\n\n            23. Rules of the Supreme Court\n                    (1) The Judges of the Supreme Court or a majority of them may make rules of court –\n                            (a) with respect to proceedings, and the practice and procedure, of that Court under the Corporations legislation; and\n                            (b) with respect to any matter or thing that is –\n                                    (i) required or permitted by the Corporations legislation to be prescribed by rules within the meaning of the Corporations legislation; or\n                                    (ii) necessary or convenient to be prescribed by such rules for carrying out or giving effect to the Corporations legislation; and\n                            (c) without limitation, with respect to costs, and with respect to rules as to meetings ordered by that Court.\n                    (2) When a lower court of Tasmania is exercising jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under the Corporations legislation, the court must apply the rules of court made under subsection (1) , with such alterations as are necessary.\n                    (3) In this section,\n                        Corporations legislation means –\n                                (a) the new Corporations Act; and\n                                (b) the new ASIC Act; and\n                                (c) the regulations made under the new Corporations Act and the new ASIC Act.\n\n            24.

Regulations\n                        (1) The Governor may make regulations for the purposes of this Act.\n                        (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , the regulations may provide that certain provisions of Part 2 are taken to be modified as set out in the regulations and, if the regulations so provide, those provisions then have effect as if they were so modified.\n                        (3) Without limiting subsection (1) , the regulations may –\n                                (a) declare a matter to be an excluded matter for the purposes of section 5F of the new Corporations Act in relation to –\n                                        (i) the whole of the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies; or\n                                        (ii) a specified provision of that legislation; or\n                                        (iii) that legislation other than a specified provision; or\n                                        (iv) that legislation otherwise than to a specified extent; and\n                                (b) declare a provision of a law of the State, or a provision of a law of the State as amended as specified in the regulations, to be a Corporations legislation displacement provision for the purposes of section 5G of the new Corporations Act (either generally or specifically in relation to a provision of the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies).\n                        (4) Without limiting subsection (1) , the regulations may make provision for or with respect to enabling jurisdiction, conferred by or under the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law, to be exercised by a court of the State, or confirming that such jurisdiction is exercisable by a court of the State, including (without limitation) provisions for or with respect to –\n                                (a) conferring jurisdiction on courts of the State; and\n                                (b) the construction of references in the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law to Commonwealth authorities and officers; and\n                                (c) the disapplication of provisions of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law, including provisions that contemplate the administration or enforcement of laws as if they were Commonwealth laws or that contemplate offences and other matters as being offences against and matters under Commonwealth laws; and\n                                (d) the treatment of offences arising under the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law (including the specification of penalties); and\n                                (e) prescribing modifications of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law; and\n                                (f) associated, procedural and consequential matters.\n                        (5) Without limiting subsection (1) , the regulations may deal with matters of a transitional nature relating to the transition from the application of provisions of the old corporations legislation or a previous State corporations law to the application of provisions of the new corporations legislation or the new ASIC legislation.\n                        (6) Any provision of the regulations may be expressed to take effect from a time that is earlier than the beginning of the day on which the regulations containing the provision are made, not being a time earlier than immediately before the relevant time.\n                        (7) To the extent to which a provision of a regulation takes effect from a time that is earlier than the beginning of the day on which the regulations containing the provision are made, the provision does not operate so as –\n                                (a) to affect in a manner prejudicial to any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) the rights of that person existing before the date of making of those regulations; or\n                                (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of making of those regulations.\n                        (8) The regulations have effect despite anything to the contrary in Part 2.\n                        (9) In this section,\n                            matters of a transitional nature includes matters of an application or savings nature.\n\n                26.

agreement.\n\n13.\n\nLimitations of Commonwealth funds\nThe funds to be provided by the Commonwealth under this agreement shall not exceed:\n    (a) in the case of the part of the work provided for by

Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ.\nMuir v Open Brethren\n[1956] HCA 14\n\nORDER\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\nCur. adv. vult.\n\nThe following written judgments were delivered:—\n\n    April 13\n    Dixon C.J., Webb and Kitto JJ.\n\n    This appeal concerns the residuary bequest contained in the last will of Charles Edmund Button late of Burnie who died on 10th November 1945. The will was duly admitted to probate. The question is whether the residuary provision is a valid charitable bequest or is void. The contest is between parties representing those who would take as on an intestacy on the one side and, on the other side, the Attorney-General representing the interest of charities and the particular body in question, namely the Open Brethren. The Open Brethren constitutes a religious body which, according to the affidavit, is known throughout the English-speaking world. There is a branch at Burnie in Tasmania consisting of an assembly which is self-governing. At Burnie there is a gospel hall held upon trust for the Open Brethren.\n\n    After appointing executors and trustees the testator's will gives, devises and bequeaths to his trustees all his real and personal property upon trust for conversion. Subject to payment of debts, the will directs that the net proceeds of conversion should be dealt with by the trustees in the manner which it proceeds to direct. There are certain specific bequests and certain directions to pay sums of money to named charitable institutions. The residuary gift the validity of which is now in question is as follows:—\&quot;To pay the balance (if any) of the said net proceeds into the funds of the Assembly or body of Christians commonly known as \&quot;Open Brethren\&quot; meeting at the date of this my Will in the Gospel Hall Wilson Street Burnie aforesaid such sum to be employed by them in relieving cases of need and distress and in assisting persons in indigent circumstances and in particular (but not exclusively or in any way that shall limit their discretion) in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the War in which the British Commonwealth of Nations is now engaged and I declare that the receipt or acknowledgement of not less than three of the Elder Brethren belonging to the said Assembly or body of Christians shall be a good discharge to my Trustees in respect of the said monies and I declare that any Brethren who are accustomed to regularly attend the business meetings of the said Assembly shall be deemed to be \&quot;Elder Brethren\&quot; within the meaning of the said term so used in my said Will.\&quot;\n\n    The validity of this provision is attacked upon the ground that a valid charitable purpose is not expressed by so much of it as provides that the sum bequeathed shall be employed by the Open Brethren in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the war. On that footing it is contended that it forms an inseverable part of the objects for which the money may be employed so that the whole bequest is void.\n\n    It is not seriously contended that if the earlier part of the provision stood alone it would not be valid as a bequest to a charitable object although it is not conceded that it would be so. There is little doubt, however, that if it were not for the words following the expression \&quot;and in particular\&quot; the provision would amount to a bequest for the relief of poverty. Clearly it must be so if the words \&quot;in relieving cases of need and distress\&quot; are confined to the relief of poverty, and upon the true construction of these words it can hardly be doubted that they do not go further than the relief of necessitous cases. In Kendall v. Granger [1] , Lord Langdale M.R. says: \&quot;In this case the direction is to apply this fund \&quot;for the relief of domestic distress, assisting indigent but deserving individuals\&quot;. I confess, in my view, that if the sentence had ended here, I should have said that this was a good charitable purpose; for its object is to relieve distress by assisting indigent but deserving individuals and that would be a valid charitable purpose because of the word \&quot;indigent\&quot; \&quot; [2] . It is, of course, undeniable that the words \&quot;in assisting persons in indigent circumstances\&quot; relate only to the relief of poverty.\n\n     1. (1842) 5 Beav. 300 [49 E.R. 593].\n     2. (1842) 5 Beav., at p. 303 [49 E.R., at p. 594].\n\n    On the other hand, it was maintained on the part of the Attorney-General and of the Open Brethren that the words \&quot;in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the War\&quot;, if they stood alone, would not go beyond a valid charitable object. But unless some very narrow construction be given to the words \&quot;adversely affected\&quot; this would indeed be a difficult view to sustain. As will appear the earlier part of the clause does enable, and in fact require, a restricted meaning to be placed upon them. But on the hypothesis that they stood alone there would not be a justification for construing them narrowly.\n\n    The real question is whether the words \&quot;in particular\&quot; confine that part of the bequest so as to make it only a special instance of that for which the earlier part of the clause provides, viz. of the relief of cases of need and distress and the assistance of persons in indigent circumstances. In the Supreme Court Gibson J. construed the bequest in this manner and upon that construction upheld it as valid.\n\n    There is a considerable amount of tautology in the provision. The same conception of poverty is referred to by the words \&quot;need\&quot;, \&quot;distress\&quot; and \&quot;indigent\&quot;. It is hard to distinguish between \&quot;relief\&quot; in the case of \&quot;need and distress\&quot; and \&quot;assistance\&quot; in the case of indigency. But clearly enough the purpose of the bequest so far is alleviation of necessitous circumstances. The challenged portion of the bequest immediately follows and is introduced by the words \&quot;in particular\&quot;. It is an expression commonly used when a special example is given of what precedes. Indeed the words \&quot;in particular\&quot; can have no other meaning. The bracketed words \&quot;but not exclusively or in any way that shall limit their discretion\&quot;, inevitably suggest a fear on the part of the draftsman that what he intended as but one example might be treated as covering the whole ground, so that the general and wider discretion he had given would be limited by his particular example. The words \&quot;assisting and relieving\&quot; are repeated from the earlier part of the clause. Although \&quot;adversely affected\&quot; is an extremely wide expression it would not be inappropriate to use it as a compendious though perhaps vague reference back to the earlier words. Probably the purpose of the provision beginning with the words \&quot;in particular\&quot; was to state that among persons in need or in distress or indigent those affected by the war formed a special object of the testator's solicitude. It is equivalent to saying \&quot;and in particular the Open Brethren are to prefer that class in employing the money\&quot;. To treat the words \&quot;in particular\&quot; as introducing a new and different class not falling at all within the earlier words would be to give the expression a very unnatural meaning. Once the clause is construed as merely giving a special example of persons in need or in distress and of persons in indigent circumstances no difficulty exists in holding it to be a good charitable bequest.\n\n    It follows that the order made by Gibson J. is correct. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\n\n    Fullagar J.\n\n    In this case I am of opinion that the decision of Gibson J. was correct, and I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice and Webb and Kitto JJ.\n\n    If the will, on its proper construction meant that the trust for \&quot;assisting and relieving persons adversely affected by the effects of the War\&quot; was a trust for a specific purpose additional to that of \&quot;relieving cases of need and distress and assisting persons in indigent circumstances\&quot;, it must, I think, have been held that we have here a trust for mixed charitable and non-charitable purposes. And, since there is in Tasmania no such statutory provision as that contained in s. 131 of the Property Law Act 1928 Vict., it must have followed that the whole trust of residue failed for uncertainty.\n\n    But the words \&quot;in particular\&quot;—reinforced and emphasised, as they seem to me to be, by the words in brackets, which immediately follow—make it clear, in my opinion, that no such specific additional purpose is intended. They show that the words \&quot;persons adversely affected by the war\&quot; are intended to describe a particular class of \&quot;persons in indigent circumstances\&quot;—a class to which the testator desires, but does not command, that preferential consideration be given.

Crown Solicitor's Office (NSW) (second and third defendants)\nFile Number(s):           2013/207773\n\n\nJudgment\n1I gave judgment in this matter on 17th October 2013 (Insurance Australia Limited t/as NRMA Insurance v Banos [2013] NSWSC 1519). The effect of the orders I made on that occasion was to set aside a decision of the second defendant, a claims assessor of the Motor Accidents Claims Assessment and Resolution Service declining to grant a discretionary exemption on the application of the plaintiff insurer pursuant to s. 92(1)(b) Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (the Compensation Act), and to remit the matter to the Principal Claims Assessor to make arrangements for a different assessor to determine the question according to law. The first defendant, who I will refer to as the claimant, was ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of, and incidental, to the proceedings on the ordinary basis after they have been agreed or assessed.\n2The claimant makes an application for a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 (NSW) (the Act), s6(1). That section provides, relevantly, the following:\n        (1) If an appeal against the decision of a court:\n        (a) to the Supreme Court on a question of law or fact ...\n        ...succeeds, the Supreme Court may, on application, grant to the respondent to the appeal or to any one or more of several respondents to the appeal an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal.\n3Two questions arise for determination. The first is whether the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service is \&quot;a court\&quot; for the purposes of the Act. The second is whether a successful claim for judicial review of an assessment made under that regime is \&quot;an appeal\&quot; for the purpose of the Act.\n4With respect to the first question, at first blush I confess to having had some doubt about the proposition that the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service, or a claims assessor operating under that regime, could constitute \&quot;a court\&quot; in the sense envisaged by the Act. However MA Campbell of counsel, who appeared for the claimant, in her written submissions directed the Court's attention to several decisions dealing with the question of applications under s 6(1) of the Act in the context of judicial review of decisions of claims assessors. In Allianz v Ward [2010] NSWSC 720 at [82] Hidden J held that a claims assessor exercising jurisdiction under the Compensation Act constitutes a \&quot;court\&quot; for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Act. In support of this proposition his Honour cited Australian Postal Commission v Dao (No 2) (1986) 6 NSWLR 497, per Kirby P at 511-14 and McHugh JA at 515-6. This approach was followed by Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) in GIO General Ltd v Smith; Insurance Australia Ltd t/as NRMA Insurance v Smith (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 998, and, I presume, by Rothman J in Allianz Australia v Tarabay [2013] NSWSC 141; 62 MVR 537. The apparently contrary decision of Rein J in QBE Insurance Australia v Henderson [2012] NSWSC 1607 was concerned with judicial review of decisions of the Medical Assessment Service, and for that reason can be put to one side as not determinative of the present question.\n5Basten JA in Campbelltown City Council v Vegan [2006] NSWCA 284; NSWLR 372 at 394 [108] pointed out that an administrative tribunal may be a court for one purpose even if not for another. By reference to DAO his Honour said:\n        Thus, a number of State tribunals have been held to be \&quot;courts\&quot; for the purposes of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) [citations omitted].\n6Consistently with this approach, several decisions of this Court have held the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal to be a court for the purposes of the Act: Krslovic Homes v Sparkes [2004] NSWSC 374; Rural and General Insurance v Fair Trading Tribunal [2004] NSWSC 396; Burringbar Real Estate Centre Pty Ltd v Ryder [2008] NSWSC 891.\n7The present case, as I have said, was concerned with an application for a discretionary exemption from an assessment of damages by the claims assessor, but it is relevant to point out that in assessing damages payable for a claim, as the words in parentheses in s94(1)(b) of the Compensation Act make clear, the claims assessor is required to determine the amount a court would be likely to award by applying the common law of damages as modified by the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Compensation Act (see also ss122 and 123). And, if the conditions specified in s95(2) are satisfied, such an assessment provides a final resolution of the dispute as to damages. These considerations favour treating the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service as a court for the purpose of the Act.\n8This finality point is heavily qualified. The claimant can reject the assessment and apply for a hearing de novo in the District Court. That qualified finality might be a strong pointer to CARS not being a court for this purpose.\n9Notwithstanding my initial doubts about it, as I find the reasoning in the decisions of other Judges of the Common Law Division referred to at [4] persuasive, and also for reasons of judicial comity, I propose to take the same approach.\n10Turning now to the second question arising for consideration, I consider the following observations of McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in Dao (No 2) from the passage referred to above to be apposite:\n        Remedial legislation should be given a beneficial construction. In accord with that philosophy, the Supreme Court has given a liberal construction to the word \&quot;appeal\&quot; in the Suitors' Fund Act. Thus an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law in a court of petty sessions is an \&quot;appeal\&quot; for the purpose of the Act: Ex parte Parsons; Re Suitors' Fund Act (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 380. So is a case stated by a court of Quarter Sessions to the Court of Criminal Appeal on a question of law arising out of a conviction in a court of petty sessions (Ex parte Neville; Re Suitors' Fund Act 1951-1960 (1966) 85 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 372) or a case stated by an arbitrator to the Supreme Court: Mir Bros Developments Pty Ltd v Atlantic Constructions Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 491. Even a reference from the Prothonotary, exercising delegated jurisdiction, to a judge in chambers is an \&quot;appeal\&quot; for the purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act: Onions v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1956) 73 WN (NSW) 270. The word \&quot;court\&quot; should likewise be given a liberal and beneficial construction to accord with the purpose and policy of the Act. The correct approach is for the Court to ask itself whether, bearing in mind the general purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act, Parliament must be taken to have intended that the Tribunal should qualify as a court? I think that that question should be answered in the affirmative. Whether the Tribunal is a \&quot;court\&quot; for purposes other than the Act is beside the point. What matters for the purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act is that a body which determines rights and is presided over by a judge of the District Court has made an error of law which has been corrected on appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. To grant a certificate, at the request of the respondents, is to promote the purpose of the Act. To hold that the Tribunal is a \&quot;court\&quot; for the purpose of the Act contradicts no express or implied provision of the Act. The Court should, therefore, declare that the respondents are entitled to a certificate under the Act.\n11By parity of reasoning, I consider that a beneficial construction of the Act favours the interpretation that the present proceedings are an appeal, as contended by the claimant. It is notable, as his Honour pointed out, that an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law was regarded as an appeal in Ex parte Parsons; Re Suitors' Fund Act (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 380. To my mind there is no reason to distinguish prohibition from an order in the nature of certiorari. Both may be concerned relevantly with the correction of legal error. There is authority supporting the proposition that an application for an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus to correct an error of law of a lower court is an appeal for the purposes of the Act: Director General of Fair Trading v O'Shane (unreported, NSWSC, Graham AJ, 22 August 1997).\n12As the High Court of Australia said in Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Eyup Kocak &amp; Ors [2013] HCA 43 at [25]:\n        The function of an order in the nature of certiorari is to remove the legal consequences or purported legal consequences of an exercise or purported exercise of power.\n13These considerations in my view make the conclusion I have reached on this second question irresistible. In my judgment the present case is directly covered by what McHugh JA said in Dao (No 2).\n14For these reasons, I amend the orders pronounced on 17th October 2013 to add the following order:\n(6)I grant the first defendant a certificate under s 6 of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW).\n\n**********\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

PART 2 - Transitional provisions

6. National scheme laws
        (1) The national scheme laws of this jurisdiction operate of their own force only in relation to –
                (a) matters arising before the relevant time; and
                (b) matters arising, directly or indirectly, out of such matters –
        in so far as those matters are not dealt with by the new corporations legislation, the new ASIC legislation or the co-operative scheme laws.
        (2) Except as provided by subsection (1) and section 9 , the national scheme laws of this jurisdiction have no operation of their own force at and after the relevant time.

7. Effect of section 6
        (1) To the extent that a national scheme law of this jurisdiction ceases to operate of its own force because of section 6 , the effect is that which would have resulted had this Act and that law been Commonwealth Acts in relation to which the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as in force on 1 November 2000 applied.
        Note: Part III of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth contains provisions dealing with the effect of repeal of an Act. These provisions protect accrued rights and liabilities and allow legal proceedings in respect of them to be commenced or continued. However, this section and section 9 have the effect of cancelling certain rights and liabilities and terminating certain legal proceedings.


            (2) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of Chapter 10 of the new Corporations Act or Part 16 of the new ASIC Act a person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability in substitution for a pre-commencement right or liability, the pre-commencement right or liability is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a right or liability under a law of the State.
            (3) Despite subsection (1) , a proceeding in a court that –
                    (a) was started before the relevant time; and
                    (b) was –
                            (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or
                            (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; and
                    (c) was a proceeding to which section 1383 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 of the new ASIC Act applies at the relevant time; and
                    (d) had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time –
            is terminated at the relevant time by force of this subsection.
            (4) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of a Commonwealth Act (other than the new Corporations Act) referred to in sections 1393 to 1396 of the new Corporations Act a person becomes liable to pay an amount that is the same, and is in respect of the same matter, as an amount (the "pre-commencement amount") that was payable by the person before the relevant time under a provision of the old corporations legislation, the person's liability to pay the pre-commencement amount is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a liability under a law of the State.
            (5) In subsection (2) ,
                pre-commencement right or liability means a right or liability, whether civil or criminal, other than a right or liability under an order made by a court before the relevant time or a liability referred to in section 1397(4) of the new Corporations Act, that –
                        (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under –
                                (i) a carried-over provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or
                                (ii) a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation that was no longer in force immediately before the relevant time; and
                        (b) was in existence immediately before the relevant time.
            (6) Nothing in this Act revives the co-operative scheme laws or otherwise affects the superseding of those laws by the national scheme laws of this jurisdiction as provided by Division 2 of Part 13 of the old application Act and any regulations made under section 80 of that Act for the purposes of that Division.

    8. Certain provisions of State law taken to operate despite national scheme law
            (1) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that –
                    (a) makes (or, if not in force, would make on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction; or
                    (b) but for the operation of section 5 of the old application Act, would have made (or, if not in force, would have made on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction –
            is declared by this subsection to have effect despite the provision or provisions of the national scheme law of this jurisdiction with which it is inconsistent and as if the relevant law, or (in the case of a relevant law that is not an Act) the Act under which the relevant law was made, had itself provided expressly for this outcome.
            Note: Section 5G of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth applies to a provision of a State law that is inconsistent with a provision of the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies if that provision operated, immediately before the commencement of that Act, despite the provision of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision.


                (2) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that provides that the whole of a previous State corporations law or a specified provision of a previous State corporations law does not apply to a matter is declared by this subsection to also provide that the whole of the old Corporations Law and the old ASIC Law or the corresponding provision (if any) of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law (as the case requires) does not apply to that matter.
                Note: Under section 5F(4) of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, if the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC law, or a provision of that Law, did not apply to a matter immediately before the commencement of that Act, then the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies, or the corresponding provision of that legislation, does not apply to the matter.


                    (3) Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply to a provision of a relevant law of the State (or a class of provision of relevant laws of the State) specified by the regulations as a provision (or class of provision) to which the subsection does not apply.
                    (4) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a provision of a relevant law of the State is inconsistent with a provision of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction if it would be inconsistent within the meaning of section 109 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia if the national scheme law were an Act of the Commonwealth.
                    (5) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 6 of the old application Act in relation to an Act enacted before the commencement of that section or an instrument made under such an Act.
                    (6) In this section –
                        matter includes act, omission, body, person or thing;
                        relevant law of the State means a law of the State enacted or made before the relevant time (whether or not it is in force before that time) other than a national scheme law of this jurisdiction or a previous State corporations law.

            9. Court proceedings and orders
                    (1) This section applies to a proceeding, whether criminal or civil, in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:
                            (a) the proceeding was started in a court before the relevant time;
                            (b) the proceeding was –
                                    (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or
                                    (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation;
                            (c) the proceeding was not a proceeding to which section 1383 or 1384 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 or 268 of the new ASIC Act applies;
                            (d) the proceeding had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time.
                    (2) Without limiting section 7(1) but subject to subsection (3) , a proceeding to which this section applies may be continued, and any order made by a court in such a proceeding may be appealed against, reviewed or enforced as if section 6 had not been enacted.
                    (3) Nothing in this Part, or in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as applying by force of section 7(1) , operates to preserve the effect of an order to which section 1383(5) of the new Corporations Act or section 267(5) of the new ASIC Act applies and, at the relevant time, that order ceases to have effect as an order of the court by which it was made and any proceeding in relation to such an order is terminated by force of this subsection.
                    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, Part 9 of the old application Act continues to have the same application to a proceeding to which this section applies as it did before the relevant time.
                    (5) In this section,
                        proceeding includes –
                                (a) a proceeding by way of appeal against, or otherwise seeking review of, an order made by a court; and
                                (b) a proceeding to enforce an order made by a court; and
                                (c) any other proceeding in respect of a breach of an order made by a court.

            10. Existing rules of court continue to have effect
                The rules of court made under section 51 of the old application Act and all other enabling powers, as in force immediately before the relevant time, continue to have effect (and may be dealt with) at and after the relevant time as if –
                        (a) they were rules of court in force under section 23 ; and
                        (b) they were made for the purposes of the provisions of the corporations legislation (within the meaning of section 23 ) that correspond to the provisions of the old Corporations Law for which they were made.

            11. References to old/new corporations legislation or old/new ASIC legislation
                    (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) , a reference in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in, an Act, an instrument made under an Act or a law applying as a law of the State by force of an Act to –

                            as if, in that subsection, the words "to be a reference" were substituted for the words "to include a reference".
                    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to references in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in –
                            (a) the old application Act or the applicable provisions (as defined in that Act) of the State; or

                    (4) For the purposes of this Act, the regulations may provide that a reference of a specified kind in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in, a specified Act or instrument made under an Act or a specified law applying as a law of the State by force of an Act is to be taken to be a reference of the kind specified in relation to the reference in the regulations.
                    (5) An express reference in an Act, an instrument made under an Act or a law applying as a law of the State by force of an Act to –
                            (a) an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the new corporations legislation or the new ASIC legislation; or
                            (b) a provision or group of provisions of such an Act, regulations or other instrument –
                    is taken, in relation to events, circumstances or things that happened or arose at a time before the relevant time, to include (unless the contrary intention appears or the context of the reference otherwise requires) a reference to the corresponding provision or provisions of the old corporations legislation, or the old ASIC legislation, as the case requires, of this jurisdiction and of each other jurisdiction referred to in sections 12(2) and (3) and 64(2) and (3) of the old application Act.

            12. References to companies incorporated in a State or Territory

                            (a) a company (within the meaning of the Corporations Law of Tasmania or of another State or a Territory) incorporated in Tasmania or that other State or that Territory; or
                            (b) a company that is incorporated under the Corporations Law of Tasmania or of another State or a Territory; or

                            as if, in that subsection, the words "to include a reference" were substituted for the words "to be a reference".

            PART 3 - Application of Commonwealth Corporations Legislation to State matters

            13. Interpretation
                In this Part –
                    applied law means a provision or provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, that this Part applies to a matter as if the provision or provisions were a law or laws of the State;
                    confer includes impose;
                    Corporations legislation means the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of the new Corporations Act applies;
                    declaratory provision means a provision of a law of the State to which this Part applies by operation of section 14 ;
                    function includes a power;
                    matter includes act, omission, body, person or thing;
                    modification includes addition, exception, omission or substitution;
                    perform includes exercise.

            14. State provisions to which this Part applies
                    (1) This Part applies to a provision of a law of the State if the provision declares a matter to be an applied Corporations legislation matter for the purposes of this Part in relation to any of the following (whether with or without modifications):
                            (a) the whole of the Corporations legislation;
                            (b) a specified Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation;
                            (c) a specified provision or provisions of the Corporations legislation or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation.
                    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a provision of a law of the State to the extent that it declares a matter to be an applied Corporations legislation matter for the purposes of this Part in relation to a provision or provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, that already applies to the matter as a law of the Commonwealth.

            15. Effect of declaratory provisions
                    (1) Subject to this Part, a declaratory provision has effect in relation to a matter as follows:
                            (a) if the declaratory provision is one to which section 14(1)(a) applies, the whole of the Corporations legislation applies to the matter as if it were a law of the State;
                            (b) if the declaratory provision is one to which section 14(1)(b) applies, the Act, regulations or other instrument specified by the declaratory provision applies or apply to the matter as if it or they were a law or laws of the State;
                            (c) if the declaratory provision is one to which section 14(1)(c) applies, the provision or provisions specified by the declaratory provision applies or apply in relation to the matter as if it or they were a law or laws of the State.
                    (2) A provision applied to a matter by a declaratory provision, or taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter, is applied as in force for the time being unless the declaratory provision applies it as in force at a particular time specified by the declaratory provision.

            16. Modifications to applied law
                    (1) This Part operates to apply a provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State subject to the following modifications:
                            (a) such modifications as may be specified by or under the law containing the declaratory provision;
                            (b) a reference to ASIC is (unless a function under an applied law is conferred on ASIC as referred to in section 17 ) taken to be a reference to –
                                    (i) the Minister administering the declaratory provision or such other person (or person belonging to a class of person) as may be specified by the regulations (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law); or
                                    (ii) such other person as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision;
                            (c) a reference to the Gazette is a reference to the Tasmanian Government Gazette;
                            (d) a reference to the Minister is a reference to the Minister administering the declaratory provision;
                            (e) a reference to this jurisdiction is a reference to Tasmania;
                            (f) such other modifications as are necessary or that are prescribed by regulations made under this Act, whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law.
                    (2) Any power to make regulations under an Act containing a declaratory provision extends to the making of regulations specifying modifications for the purposes of this Part.
                    (3) Except as provided by subsection (1) , definitions and other interpretation provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of the Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, relevant to the applied law are taken also to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision.
                    (4) This section has effect subject to sections 17 to 20 .

            17. Conferral of functions on ASIC
                    (1) Neither a declaratory provision nor an applied law operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to the applied law unless –
                            (a) the declaratory provision provides for ASIC to perform that function pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of the kind referred to in section 11(8) or (9A)(b) of the new ASIC Act; and
                            (b) ASIC is authorised to perform that function under section 11 of the new ASIC Act.
                    (2) If a declaratory provision operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to an applied law, the conferral of that function is taken not to impose a duty to perform that function despite anything to the contrary in the applied law.

            18. Conferral of functions or duties on State courts
                An applied law that confers a function or duty on a court or on the Court is taken to confer that function or duty (along with the jurisdiction to perform that function or duty) on the Supreme Court or such other court of the State as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision.

            19. Implied application of regulations and other provisions of Corporations legislation
                    (1) Unless a declaratory provision provides otherwise, the following provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, are also taken to apply to a matter that is the subject of a declaratory provision as if they were laws of the State:
                            (a) the provisions of any regulations made under the applied law;
                            (b) any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, that creates an offence in relation to a contravention of the applied law or specifies the penalty for an offence created by a provision of the applied law;
                            (c) the provisions of Part 9.4B (Civil consequences of contravening civil penalty provisions) of the new Corporations Act for the purposes of any provision of the applied law that is a civil penalty provision within the meaning of that Part.
                    (2) The regulations may prescribe modifications (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law) of any of the provisions that are also taken to apply to a matter by force of subsection (1) for the purposes of that application.

            20. Proceedings for offences
                    (1) Proceedings for an offence against an applied law may be dealt with as an offence against a law of the State.
                    (2) For the purposes of an offence against an applied law –
                            (a) the amount of a penalty unit specified in relation to that offence by the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, is $100; and
                            (b) the laws of the State apply in relation to that offence as if the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, were a law or laws of the State.
                    (3) Without limiting subsection (2)(b) , the laws of the State referred to in that subsection as applying in relation to an offence include laws with respect to –
                            (a) the investigation and prosecution of offences; and
                            (b) the arrest, custody, bail, trial, finding of guilt and conviction of persons charged with offences; and
                            (c) proceedings relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; and
                            (d) the classification of offences as indictable or summary or indictable triable summarily; and
                            (e) appeals and reviews relating to criminal proceedings and to proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (c) ; and
                            (f) the sentencing, punishment and release of persons found guilty or convicted of offences; and
                            (g) fines, penalties and forfeitures; and
                            (h) confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

            21. Application of Corporations legislation by other means
                Nothing in this Part prevents a law of the State from applying any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State otherwise than by means of a declaratory provision.

            PART 4 - General

                            (a) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 ; or

            23. Rules of the Supreme Court
                    (1) The Judges of the Supreme Court or a majority of them may make rules of court –
                            (a) with respect to proceedings, and the practice and procedure, of that Court under the Corporations legislation; and
                            (b) with respect to any matter or thing that is –
                                    (i) required or permitted by the Corporations legislation to be prescribed by rules within the meaning of the Corporations legislation; or
                                    (ii) necessary or convenient to be prescribed by such rules for carrying out or giving effect to the Corporations legislation; and
                            (c) without limitation, with respect to costs, and with respect to rules as to meetings ordered by that Court.

                    (3) In this section,

                                (b) the new ASIC Act; and

                    (2) An agreement or arrangement of a kind referred to in subsection (1) has effect by force of this section despite any provision of a law of the State with respect to any function or power that is the subject of the agreement or arrangement.

                                (d) the treatment of offences arising under the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law (including the specification of penalties); and
                                (e) prescribing modifications of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation or a previous State corporations law; and
                                (f) associated, procedural and consequential matters.
                        (5) Without limiting subsection (1) , the regulations may deal with matters of a transitional nature relating to the transition from the application of provisions of the old corporations legislation or a previous State corporations law to the application of provisions of the new corporations legislation or the new ASIC legislation.

                        (7) To the extent to which a provision of a regulation takes effect from a time that is earlier than the beginning of the day on which the regulations containing the provision are made, the provision does not operate so as –
                                (a) to affect in a manner prejudicial to any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) the rights of that person existing before the date of making of those regulations; or
                                (b) to impose liabilities on any person (other than the State or an authority of the State) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of making of those regulations.
                        (8) The regulations have effect despite anything to the contrary in Part 2.

        (4) It shall be the duty of the Surveyor-General when requested so to do to advise the surveyor of any public authority or any registered surveyor as to how proposed surveys of any area may be connected with the established permanent survey marks, and to authorize any indirect connection as provided by this section which appears to him to be more convenient or economical than a direct connection, and any survey carried out, or plan prepared, in accordance with the written authority of the Surveyor-General shall, if the authority is attached to the plan, be deemed for all purposes a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section.

    It shall be the duty of the Surveyor-General to –
            (a) advise the proper officer of any public authority or any registered surveyor of all registered plans and of all proposed surveys which may render unnecessary, or limit the scope of, any survey proposed to be carried out by or on behalf of that authority or by the registered surveyor; and

14. Adoption of existing survey marks as permanent marks
        (1) The Surveyor-General may adopt any particular reference marks or other survey marks, or any class of reference marks or other survey marks, established by any public authority, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, as permanent marks for the purposes of this Act by publication of a notice in the Gazette specifying the marks or class of marks so adopted.

        and every person authorized by the Surveyor-General or by the proper officer of the public authority concerned shall, at all reasonable times, have access to such land, street, road, right of way, lane, or thoroughfare for the purpose of the establishment, inspection, and maintenance of any permanent mark or the connection of any survey with any permanent mark.
        (3) All permanent marks established by the Surveyor-General under this Act, for any survey area proposed to be proclaimed in pursuance of this Act, shall be established out of moneys provided by Parliament for survey purposes, and shall be maintained in good order and condition –
                (a) if upon any land, other than a public street, road, right of way, lane, or thoroughfare, vested in, or under the care and management of any public authority, or of any committee of management or body of trustees for any public purpose – by the authority, committee, or body concerned, out of such moneys as are available for the care and management of such land; or
                (b) if upon any public street, road, right of way, lane, or thoroughfare the maintenance whereof is charged upon any public authority – by that authority out of such moneys as are available for the maintenance of such street, road, right of way, lane, or thoroughfare; or
                (c) if upon any privately owned land – by the Surveyor-General; or
                (d) in any other case, by the council of the municipal area in which the marks are established.
        (4) All permanent marks established by any public authority in compliance with any requirement of the Surveyor-General under section six in relation to any survey carried out by or on behalf of the authority shall be established out of such moneys as are available to the authority concerned for the purposes of such survey, and all permanent marks so established, and all permanent marks adopted under the provisions of this section, shall be maintained in good order and condition out of moneys available for the maintenance of the works or undertakings of the public authority concerned: Provided that, where the Commissioner of Crown Lands is satisfied, upon the application of any public authority, that the maintenance of any such mark involves undue expense or inconvenience to such authority, he may direct that such maintenance shall be carried out by the Surveyor-General or by such other public authority, committee of management, or body of trustees, as the Minister may direct.

15. Notice of establishment, &amp;c., of permanent mark to public authority charged with maintenance
        (1) The Surveyor-General shall, where necessary, give notice, in writing, of the establishment, removal, or alteration of any permanent mark to the public authority, committee of management, or body of trustees, as the case requires, charged under this Act with the maintenance thereof.
        (2) The Surveyor-General shall give notice, in writing, to the Recorder of Titles of the establishment, removal, or alteration of any permanent mark in any case where he considers that the establishment, removal, or alteration thereof is likely to affect any plan lodged or retained in the office of the Recorder of Titles.

16. Surveyors to report irregularities in position of permanent marks
        (1) Any surveyor who discovers any apparent irregularity in the position of any permanent mark, or that any permanent mark has been destroyed or removed, or is in disrepair, or that any measurements made by him differ from those shown upon any registered plan, shall furnish a report thereon, in writing, to the Surveyor-General.
        (2) Any officer or employee of any public authority, not being a surveyor, who discovers that any permanent mark has been destroyed or removed or is in disrepair, shall report the same to the proper officer of such authority who shall thereupon notify the same, in writing, to the Surveyor-General.

17. Cost of surveys, &amp;c.
    The cost of any survey authorized to be carried out by the Surveyor-General under this Act shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament for survey purposes.

18.

19. Exemption of plans, surveys, &amp;c., from operation of this Act
    Upon the application of any public authority or any registered surveyor, the Surveyor-General may, by writing under his hand, exempt from all or any of the provisions of this Act relating to surveys or plans, either permanently or for any specified period and subject to such conditions, if any, as the Surveyor-General thinks fit, any particular survey being carried out, or proposed to be carried out by that authority or surveyor, or any particular plan of survey in the possession of, or to be prepared by, that authority or surveyor, or any class of such surveys or plans, if he is of opinion that compliance with such provisions in respect of the particular survey or plan or class of surveys or plans would entail the disclosure of any information which would adversely affect the public or such authority or the person by whom the surveyor is employed.

20. Penalty for destruction, &amp;c., of permanent marks
        (1) No person shall destroy, remove, injure, or deface, or directly or indirectly cause any alteration in the position of, any permanent mark established or adopted under this Act.

        (2) Upon the conviction of any person for any offence against this section, the court may, in addition to imposing a penalty under subsection (1) hereof, order that the defendant shall pay to the public authority, committee of management, or body of trustees charged with the maintenance of the permanent mark in respect of which the proceedings were instituted, such amount as the court thinks reasonably necessary to reimburse the public authority, committee, or body of trustees for any expenses incurred in replacing or re-establishing the mark.
        (3) Where the removal or alteration of any permanent mark is necessary by reason of any operations connected with the erection or reconstruction of any building, the removal or alteration of the mark for that purpose shall not constitute a contravention of this section, but the removal or alteration thereof may be effected subject to such provisions as to notice and report to the Surveyor-General, and re-establishment of the permanent mark, as may be prescribed.

[Royal Assent 29 April 1987]

Be it enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly, in Parliament assembled, as follows:

1. Short title
    This Act may be cited as the Penalty Units and Other Penalties Act 1987 .

2. Commencement
        (1) Except as provided in this section and subject to subsection (3) , this Act shall commence on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
        (2) Section 6 and Schedule 2 shall be deemed to have commenced on 30th September 1981.
        (3) Where the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent is a day before the day fixed by proclamation under section 2 (2) of the Police Offences Amendment Act (No. 2) 1985 –
                (a) section 7 (1) and Schedule 3 shall commence on that first-mentioned day; and
                (b) section 7 (2) and Schedule 4 shall be repealed.
        (4) Where the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent is a day on or after the day fixed by proclamation under section 2 (2) of the Police Offences Amendment Act (No. 2) 1985 –
                (a) section 7 (2) and Schedule 4 shall commence; and
                (b) section 7 (1) and Schedule 3 shall be repealed –
        on the day so fixed by proclamation.

3. Interpretation
    In this Act –
        statutory rule has the meaning assigned to that expression by the Rules Publication Act 1953 ;
        subordinate instrument means an instrument that is –
                (a) a statutory rule; or
                (b) not a statutory rule but which is a regulation, rule, or by-law or any other instrument of a legislative character.

4. Penalty units
    Where, in any Act or subordinate instrument for the time being in force, a number (whether whole or fractional) of what in the Act or subordinate instrument are referred to as "penalty units" is prescribed as the penalty for an offence against that Act or subordinate instrument or is specified for some other purpose in that Act or subordinate instrument, then the Act or subordinate instrument shall, subject to section 37 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 , be construed as setting out a penalty of a number of dollars equal to the product obtained by multiplying the amount specified in the most recent notice published under section 4A(4) by the number of penalty units so prescribed or so specified.

4A. Indexation of penalty units
        (1) The value of a penalty unit for the financial year commencing on 1 July 2015 is $154.
        (2) The value of a penalty unit for the financial year commencing on 1 July 2016, and for each subsequent financial year, is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula and rounded off in accordance with subsection (3) :
        where –
            A is the value in dollars of a penalty unit for the relevant financial year;
            B is $154;
            C is the value of the CPI figure for Hobart for the December quarter immediately preceding the financial year in which the value of the penalty unit is to apply;
            D is the value of the CPI figure for Hobart for the December quarter 2014 (as published with the CPI figure for Hobart for the March quarter immediately preceding the financial year in which the value of the penalty unit is to apply).
        (3) If the amount calculated in accordance with the formula specified in subsection (2) is an amount which is dollars and a number of cents, the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
        (4) On or before 1 June in each year, the Minister is to publish in the Gazette notice of the value of a penalty unit that is to apply for the financial year commencing on 1 July in that year.
        (5) An increase in the value of a penalty unit is of no effect unless notice of the value of the penalty unit is published under subsection (4) .
        (6) A notice under subsection (4) is not a statutory rule within the meaning of the Rules Publication Act 1953 .
        (7) If, for a financial year, the value of a penalty unit calculated in accordance with the formula specified in subsection (2) results in a reduction in that value –
                (a) the reduction is of no effect; and
                (b) the notice published under subsection (4) is to specify that the value of a penalty unit for that financial year is to be the same as in the previous financial year.
        (8) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Penalty Units and Other Penalties Amendment Act 2015 affects the validity of the value of a penalty unit calculated before the commencement of that Act.
        (9) In this section –
            CPI figure for Hobart means the Consumer Price Index: All Groups Index Number for Hobart published by the Australian Statistician under the authority of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 of the Commonwealth.

Muir v Open Brethren
[1956] HCA 14

ORDER
Appeal dismissed with costs.

Cur. adv. vult.

The following written judgments were delivered:—

    April 13
    Dixon C.J., Webb and Kitto JJ.

    This appeal concerns the residuary bequest contained in the last will of Charles Edmund Button late of Burnie who died on 10th November 1945. The will was duly admitted to probate. The question is whether the residuary provision is a valid charitable bequest or is void. The contest is between parties representing those who would take as on an intestacy on the one side and, on the other side, the Attorney-General representing the interest of charities and the particular body in question, namely the Open Brethren. The Open Brethren constitutes a religious body which, according to the affidavit, is known throughout the English-speaking world. There is a branch at Burnie in Tasmania consisting of an assembly which is self-governing. At Burnie there is a gospel hall held upon trust for the Open Brethren.

    After appointing executors and trustees the testator's will gives, devises and bequeaths to his trustees all his real and personal property upon trust for conversion. Subject to payment of debts, the will directs that the net proceeds of conversion should be dealt with by the trustees in the manner which it proceeds to direct. There are certain specific bequests and certain directions to pay sums of money to named charitable institutions. The residuary gift the validity of which is now in question is as follows:—"To pay the balance (if any) of the said net proceeds into the funds of the Assembly or body of Christians commonly known as "Open Brethren" meeting at the date of this my Will in the Gospel Hall Wilson Street Burnie aforesaid such sum to be employed by them in relieving cases of need and distress and in assisting persons in indigent circumstances and in particular (but not exclusively or in any way that shall limit their discretion) in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the War in which the British Commonwealth of Nations is now engaged and I declare that the receipt or acknowledgement of not less than three of the Elder Brethren belonging to the said Assembly or body of Christians shall be a good discharge to my Trustees in respect of the said monies and I declare that any Brethren who are accustomed to regularly attend the business meetings of the said Assembly shall be deemed to be "Elder Brethren" within the meaning of the said term so used in my said Will."

    The validity of this provision is attacked upon the ground that a valid charitable purpose is not expressed by so much of it as provides that the sum bequeathed shall be employed by the Open Brethren in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the war. On that footing it is contended that it forms an inseverable part of the objects for which the money may be employed so that the whole bequest is void.

    It is not seriously contended that if the earlier part of the provision stood alone it would not be valid as a bequest to a charitable object although it is not conceded that it would be so. There is little doubt, however, that if it were not for the words following the expression "and in particular" the provision would amount to a bequest for the relief of poverty. Clearly it must be so if the words "in relieving cases of need and distress" are confined to the relief of poverty, and upon the true construction of these words it can hardly be doubted that they do not go further than the relief of necessitous cases. In Kendall v. Granger [1] , Lord Langdale M.R. says: "In this case the direction is to apply this fund "for the relief of domestic distress, assisting indigent but deserving individuals". I confess, in my view, that if the sentence had ended here, I should have said that this was a good charitable purpose; for its object is to relieve distress by assisting indigent but deserving individuals and that would be a valid charitable purpose because of the word "indigent" " [2] . It is, of course, undeniable that the words "in assisting persons in indigent circumstances" relate only to the relief of poverty.

     1. (1842) 5 Beav. 300 [49 E.R. 593].
     2. (1842) 5 Beav., at p. 303 [49 E.R., at p. 594].

    On the other hand, it was maintained on the part of the Attorney-General and of the Open Brethren that the words "in assisting and relieving persons who have been or shall be adversely affected by the effects of the War", if they stood alone, would not go beyond a valid charitable object. But unless some very narrow construction be given to the words "adversely affected" this would indeed be a difficult view to sustain. As will appear the earlier part of the clause does enable, and in fact require, a restricted meaning to be placed upon them. But on the hypothesis that they stood alone there would not be a justification for construing them narrowly.

    The real question is whether the words "in particular" confine that part of the bequest so as to make it only a special instance of that for which the earlier part of the clause provides, viz. of the relief of cases of need and distress and the assistance of persons in indigent circumstances. In the Supreme Court Gibson J. construed the bequest in this manner and upon that construction upheld it as valid.

    There is a considerable amount of tautology in the provision. The same conception of poverty is referred to by the words "need", "distress" and "indigent". It is hard to distinguish between "relief" in the case of "need and distress" and "assistance" in the case of indigency. But clearly enough the purpose of the bequest so far is alleviation of necessitous circumstances. The challenged portion of the bequest immediately follows and is introduced by the words "in particular". It is an expression commonly used when a special example is given of what precedes. Indeed the words "in particular" can have no other meaning. The bracketed words "but not exclusively or in any way that shall limit their discretion", inevitably suggest a fear on the part of the draftsman that what he intended as but one example might be treated as covering the whole ground, so that the general and wider discretion he had given would be limited by his particular example. The words "assisting and relieving" are repeated from the earlier part of the clause. Although "adversely affected" is an extremely wide expression it would not be inappropriate to use it as a compendious though perhaps vague reference back to the earlier words. Probably the purpose of the provision beginning with the words "in particular" was to state that among persons in need or in distress or indigent those affected by the war formed a special object of the testator's solicitude. It is equivalent to saying "and in particular the Open Brethren are to prefer that class in employing the money". To treat the words "in particular" as introducing a new and different class not falling at all within the earlier words would be to give the expression a very unnatural meaning. Once the clause is construed as merely giving a special example of persons in need or in distress and of persons in indigent circumstances no difficulty exists in holding it to be a good charitable bequest.

    It follows that the order made by Gibson J. is correct. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

    Fullagar J.

    In this case I am of opinion that the decision of Gibson J. was correct, and I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice and Webb and Kitto JJ.

    If the will, on its proper construction meant that the trust for "assisting and relieving persons adversely affected by the effects of the War" was a trust for a specific purpose additional to that of "relieving cases of need and distress and assisting persons in indigent circumstances", it must, I think, have been held that we have here a trust for mixed charitable and non-charitable purposes. And, since there is in Tasmania no such statutory provision as that contained in s. 131 of the Property Law Act 1928 Vict., it must have followed that the whole trust of residue failed for uncertainty.

    But the words "in particular"—reinforced and emphasised, as they seem to me to be, by the words in brackets, which immediately follow—make it clear, in my opinion, that no such specific additional purpose is intended. They show that the words "persons adversely affected by the war" are intended to describe a particular class of "persons in indigent circumstances"—a class to which the testator desires, but does not command, that preferential consideration be given. The whole trust is thus seen to be a trust for the relief of poverty, and nothing else, and such a trust is a charitable trust.

    The appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.</span></div></div>

Judgment
1I gave judgment in this matter on 17th October 2013 (Insurance Australia Limited t/as NRMA Insurance v Banos [2013] NSWSC 1519). The effect of the orders I made on that occasion was to set aside a decision of the second defendant, a claims assessor of the Motor Accidents Claims Assessment and Resolution Service declining to grant a discretionary exemption on the application of the plaintiff insurer pursuant to s. 92(1)(b) Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (the Compensation Act), and to remit the matter to the Principal Claims Assessor to make arrangements for a different assessor to determine the question according to law. The first defendant, who I will refer to as the claimant, was ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of, and incidental, to the proceedings on the ordinary basis after they have been agreed or assessed.
2The claimant makes an application for a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 (NSW) (the Act), s6(1). That section provides, relevantly, the following:
        (1) If an appeal against the decision of a court:
        (a) to the Supreme Court on a question of law or fact ...
        ...succeeds, the Supreme Court may, on application, grant to the respondent to the appeal or to any one or more of several respondents to the appeal an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal.
3Two questions arise for determination. The first is whether the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service is "a court" for the purposes of the Act. The second is whether a successful claim for judicial review of an assessment made under that regime is "an appeal" for the purpose of the Act.
4With respect to the first question, at first blush I confess to having had some doubt about the proposition that the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service, or a claims assessor operating under that regime, could constitute "a court" in the sense envisaged by the Act. However MA Campbell of counsel, who appeared for the claimant, in her written submissions directed the Court's attention to several decisions dealing with the question of applications under s 6(1) of the Act in the context of judicial review of decisions of claims assessors. In Allianz v Ward [2010] NSWSC 720 at [82] Hidden J held that a claims assessor exercising jurisdiction under the Compensation Act constitutes a "court" for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Act. In support of this proposition his Honour cited Australian Postal Commission v Dao (No 2) (1986) 6 NSWLR 497, per Kirby P at 511-14 and McHugh JA at 515-6. This approach was followed by Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) in GIO General Ltd v Smith; Insurance Australia Ltd t/as NRMA Insurance v Smith (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 998, and, I presume, by Rothman J in Allianz Australia v Tarabay [2013] NSWSC 141; 62 MVR 537. The apparently contrary decision of Rein J in QBE Insurance Australia v Henderson [2012] NSWSC 1607 was concerned with judicial review of decisions of the Medical Assessment Service, and for that reason can be put to one side as not determinative of the present question.
5Basten JA in Campbelltown City Council v Vegan [2006] NSWCA 284; NSWLR 372 at 394 [108] pointed out that an administrative tribunal may be a court for one purpose even if not for another. By reference to DAO his Honour said:
        Thus, a number of State tribunals have been held to be "courts" for the purposes of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) [citations omitted].
6Consistently with this approach, several decisions of this Court have held the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal to be a court for the purposes of the Act: Krslovic Homes v Sparkes [2004] NSWSC 374; Rural and General Insurance v Fair Trading Tribunal [2004] NSWSC 396; Burringbar Real Estate Centre Pty Ltd v Ryder [2008] NSWSC 891.
7The present case, as I have said, was concerned with an application for a discretionary exemption from an assessment of damages by the claims assessor, but it is relevant to point out that in assessing damages payable for a claim, as the words in parentheses in s94(1)(b) of the Compensation Act make clear, the claims assessor is required to determine the amount a court would be likely to award by applying the common law of damages as modified by the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Compensation Act (see also ss122 and 123). And, if the conditions specified in s95(2) are satisfied, such an assessment provides a final resolution of the dispute as to damages. These considerations favour treating the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service as a court for the purpose of the Act.
8This finality point is heavily qualified. The claimant can reject the assessment and apply for a hearing de novo in the District Court. That qualified finality might be a strong pointer to CARS not being a court for this purpose.
9Notwithstanding my initial doubts about it, as I find the reasoning in the decisions of other Judges of the Common Law Division referred to at [4] persuasive, and also for reasons of judicial comity, I propose to take the same approach.
10Turning now to the second question arising for consideration, I consider the following observations of McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in Dao (No 2) from the passage referred to above to be apposite:
        Remedial legislation should be given a beneficial construction. In accord with that philosophy, the Supreme Court has given a liberal construction to the word "appeal" in the Suitors' Fund Act. Thus an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law in a court of petty sessions is an "appeal" for the purpose of the Act: Ex parte Parsons; Re Suitors' Fund Act (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 380. So is a case stated by a court of Quarter Sessions to the Court of Criminal Appeal on a question of law arising out of a conviction in a court of petty sessions (Ex parte Neville; Re Suitors' Fund Act 1951-1960 (1966) 85 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 372) or a case stated by an arbitrator to the Supreme Court: Mir Bros Developments Pty Ltd v Atlantic Constructions Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 491. Even a reference from the Prothonotary, exercising delegated jurisdiction, to a judge in chambers is an "appeal" for the purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act: Onions v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1956) 73 WN (NSW) 270. The word "court" should likewise be given a liberal and beneficial construction to accord with the purpose and policy of the Act. The correct approach is for the Court to ask itself whether, bearing in mind the general purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act, Parliament must be taken to have intended that the Tribunal should qualify as a court? I think that that question should be answered in the affirmative. Whether the Tribunal is a "court" for purposes other than the Act is beside the point. What matters for the purpose of the Suitors' Fund Act is that a body which determines rights and is presided over by a judge of the District Court has made an error of law which has been corrected on appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. To grant a certificate, at the request of the respondents, is to promote the purpose of the Act. To hold that the Tribunal is a "court" for the purpose of the Act contradicts no express or implied provision of the Act. The Court should, therefore, declare that the respondents are entitled to a certificate under the Act.
11By parity of reasoning, I consider that a beneficial construction of the Act favours the interpretation that the present proceedings are an appeal, as contended by the claimant. It is notable, as his Honour pointed out, that an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law was regarded as an appeal in Ex parte Parsons; Re Suitors' Fund Act (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 380. To my mind there is no reason to distinguish prohibition from an order in the nature of certiorari. Both may be concerned relevantly with the correction of legal error. There is authority supporting the proposition that an application for an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus to correct an error of law of a lower court is an appeal for the purposes of the Act: Director General of Fair Trading v O'Shane (unreported, NSWSC, Graham AJ, 22 August 1997).
12As the High Court of Australia said in Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Eyup Kocak &amp; Ors [2013] HCA 43 at [25]:
        The function of an order in the nature of certiorari is to remove the legal consequences or purported legal consequences of an exercise or purported exercise of power.
13These considerations in my view make the conclusion I have reached on this second question irresistible. In my judgment the present case is directly covered by what McHugh JA said in Dao (No 2).
14For these reasons, I amend the orders pronounced on 17th October 2013 to add the following order:
(6)I grant the first defendant a certificate under s 6 of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW).

		<strong>Open Australian Legal Corpus ‍⚖️</strong>

<p><a alt="Release" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/open-australian-legal-corpus"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v7.1.0-green"></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Open Australian Legal Corpus</strong> by <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="https://isaacus.com/">Isaacus</a></strong> is the first and only multijurisdictional open corpus of Australian legislative and judicial documents.</p>
<p>Comprised of 229,122 texts totalling over 60 million lines and 1.4 billion tokens, the Corpus includes every in force statute and regulation in the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Norfolk Island, in addition to thousands of bills and hundreds of thousands of court and tribunal decisions.</p>
<p>As the largest free and open database of its kind to date, the Corpus is intended to progress the burgeoning field of legal AI research in Australia by allowing researchers to pretrain and finetune machine learning models for downstream natural language processing tasks applied to the Australian legal domain such as document classification, summarisation, information retrieval and question answering.</p>
<p>To ensure its accessibility to as wide an audience as possible, the Corpus and all its documents are distributed under open source licences that, in most cases, allow for both non-commercial and commercial usage (see the <a rel="nofollow" href="/datasets/isaacus/open-australian-legal-corpus/blob/main/LICENCE.md">Licence 📄</a>).</p>
<p>Those interested in learning more about the Corpus are encouraged to read Umar Butler's accompanying article, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/"><em>How I built the largest open database of Australian law</em></a>.</p>

</li>
<li>Minor releases are for when:<ul>
<li>New sources have been added to the Corpus;</li>
<li>Sources have been removed from the Corpus;</li>
<li>The entire Corpus has been rescraped; or</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Patch releases are for when:<ul>
<li>New documents from pre-existing sources have been added to the Corpus;</li>
