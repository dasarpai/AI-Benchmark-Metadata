Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;labels\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;BACKGROUND\&quot;,\n    \&quot;METHODS\&quot;,\n    \&quot;RESULTS\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;meshes\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Adult\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Anthracyclines\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Antigens, CD\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Antigens, CD20\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Antineoplastic Agents\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Breast Neoplasms\&quot;,\n    \&quot;CD3 Complex\&quot;,\n    \&quot;CD4 Antigens\&quot;,\n    \&quot;CD8 Antigens\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Female\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Forkhead Transcription Factors\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Humans\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Middle Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Neoadjuvant Therapy\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Prognosis\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Taxoids\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Trastuzumab\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Tumor Microenvironment\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Young Adult\&quot;\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;long_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting).

These measurements were obtained on KPro-implanted eyes, pseudophakic eyes as controls, and on the same control eyes after fixing the pupil diameter to 3 and 2 mm using black painted iris contact lenses.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Ten KPro eyes and five control eyes were included. Good agreement was noted between the subjective refractions and autorefraction in KPro eyes. The average through-focus curve for the control eyes was significantly steeper than that of the KPro curve, but became comparable after fixing the control pupil to 2 and 3 mm.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;labels\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;OBJECTIVE\&quot;,\n    \&quot;METHODS\&quot;,\n    \&quot;RESULTS\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;meshes\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Accommodation, Ocular\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Adult\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aged, 80 and over\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Analysis of Variance\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Artificial Organs\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Case-Control Studies\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cornea\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Corneal Diseases\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Depth Perception\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Female\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Humans\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Lens Implantation, Intraocular\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Male\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Middle Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Prostheses and Implants\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Refractive Errors\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Visual Acuity\&quot;\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;long_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The KPro's wide depth-of-focus makes the visual acuity less dependent on an exact refractive correction at distance and explains the 'pseudoaccomodation' experienced by these patients.

Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;labels\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;BACKGROUND\&quot;,\n    \&quot;METHODS\&quot;,\n    \&quot;RESULTS\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;meshes\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Adult\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aged, 80 and over\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aging\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cognition\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cognition Disorders\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cross-Sectional Studies\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Executive Function\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Female\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Humans\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Intracranial Hemorrhages\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Magnetic Resonance Imaging\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Male\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Memory\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Middle Aged\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Neuropsychological Tests\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Retrospective Studies\&quot;\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;long_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Lobar microbleeds, a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, are associated with an accelerated rate of executive function decline.

To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines.&quot;,&quot;We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity.&quot;],&quot;labels&quot;:[&quot;BACKGROUND&quot;,&quot;RESULTS&quot;],&quot;meshes&quot;:[&quot;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic&quot;,&quot;Apoptosis&quot;,&quot;Cell Line, Tumor&quot;,&quot;DNA-Binding Proteins&quot;,&quot;Endoplasmic Reticulum&quot;,&quot;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress&quot;,&quot;Hep G2 Cells&quot;,&quot;Humans&quot;,&quot;Neoplasms&quot;,&quot;Palmitates&quot;,&quot;Reactive Oxygen Species&quot;,&quot;Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors&quot;,&quot;Resveratrol&quot;,&quot;Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase&quot;,&quot;Stilbenes&quot;,&quot;Transcription Factor CHOP&quot;,&quot;Transcription Factors&quot;,&quot;Triglycerides&quot;,&quot;X-Box Binding Protein 1&quot;]},&quot;string&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;contexts\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Palmitate, a saturated fatty acid (FA), is known to induce toxicity and cell death in various types of cells.

Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has recently been linked to cellular adipogenic responses. To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;labels\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;BACKGROUND\&quot;,\n    \&quot;RESULTS\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;meshes\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Apoptosis\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Cell Line, Tumor\&quot;,\n    \&quot;DNA-Binding Proteins\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Endoplasmic Reticulum\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Hep G2 Cells\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Humans\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Neoplasms\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Palmitates\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Reactive Oxygen Species\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Resveratrol\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Stilbenes\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Transcription Factor CHOP\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Transcription Factors\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Triglycerides\&quot;,\n    \&quot;X-Box Binding Protein 1\&quot;\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;long_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Our results suggest that RSV exerts its cytotoxic role in cancer cells exposed to a saturated FA context primarily by triglyceride accumulation inhibition, probably leading to an intracellular palmitate accumulation that triggers a lipid-mediated cell death.

Renal injury and histology were assessed by a recovery protocol. The procedure was identical to the nonrecovery arm but with a single dose of hydrogen sulfide (30 μg/kg) and animals were recovered for 7 days.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;There was no difference in animal weight between the groups (P = 0.337). In the nonrecovery arm, there was a reduction in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in sulfide-treated animals compared with controls (909 ± 98 vs. 607 ± 159 pg/mL; P = 0.0038). There was also a reduction in myeloperoxidase-positive cells in renal tissue in the sulfide-treated animals compared with controls (8 ± 4 vs. 17 ± 9; P = 0.03). There was no difference in histological injury score or endothelin-1 levels. In the recovery arm, there was no difference in renal function, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 levels, or histological injury scores.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;labels\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;BACKGROUND\&quot;,\n    \&quot;METHODS\&quot;,\n    \&quot;RESULTS\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;meshes\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Acute Kidney Injury\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Animals\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Anti-Inflammatory Agents\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Aorta, Abdominal\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Constriction\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Disease Models, Animal\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Hydrogen Sulfide\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Inflammation\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Kidney\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Male\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Rats\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Rats, Wistar\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Reperfusion Injury\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Warm Ischemia\&quot;\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;long_answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hydrogen sulfide has systemic and renal anti-inflammatory effects in remote IRI following aortic occlusion in rats.&quot;},&quot;final_decision&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:211269,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMjk5Niwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL3FpYW9qaW4vUHViTWVkUUEiLCJleHAiOjE3NDI5MjY1OTYsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHVnZ2luZ2ZhY2UuY28ifQ.8ZKslZpGxPtqE6z-IdtZzjCrV4oj7Uc65Cunfmu1TxCNgypm-nCbMMxgwKlfqm26DOsSlDYQrLiercDBpn9GDQ&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;qiaojin/PubMedQA&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;633f51417f69125dcea06aca&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/2b7fe0d262e336932741d0b498987ae5.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Qiao Jin&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;qiaojin&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:10},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

    "The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease.",
    "A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score.",
    "35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04)."

    "HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice."

Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between case and control samples. Transcription factor binding site prediction and luciferase reporter assays were employed to assess the potential function of promoter SNPs.

Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that risk allele rs2301228-A significantly down-regulated NCAM1 gene transcription compared to the G-allele. Concordantly, schizophrenia patients had a significantly lower level of serum NCAM1 compared to healthy donors.

    "Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied.",
    "Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%). Of buried penis cases 78% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0.001). Of hypospadias cases 70% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p &lt; 0.001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II."

Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor).

HBsAg-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells were detected in splenocytes from these mice. Naïve normal mice receiving splenocytes from the mice immunized with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag generated immediate recall immune responses, e.g., the mice that received CD4(+)CD25(+)-depleted splenocytes generated anti-HBs on day 3 after HBsAg challenge while those receiving cells from sham-immunized mice did not."

    "Normal aging is associated with a decline in cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of psychomotor speed and executive functioning. However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults.",
    "Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan.",
    "Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p &lt; 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit."

Carriers of rs5063 had lower NT-proANP levels (1427 versus 2291 pmol/L; P&lt;0.001) and higher diastolic blood pressures (75 versus 73 mm Hg; P=0.009) and were at an increased risk of stroke when compared with wild-type subjects independent of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cholesterol levels (hazard ratio, 1.6; P=0.004)."

TBI was produced by lateral fluid percussion (LFP; >2 ATM; 25ms). Alcohol drinking and neurobehavioral function were measured at baseline and following TBI in all experimental groups. Markers of neuroinflammation (GFAP and ED1) and neurodegeneration (FJC) were determined by fluorescence histochemistry in brains excised at sacrifice 19 days post-TBI.",
    "The cumulative increase in alcohol intake over the 15 days post-TBI was greater in TBI animals compared to naïve controls. A higher rate of pre-injury alcohol intake was associated with a greater increase in post-injury alcohol intake in both TBI and craniotomy animals. Immediately following TBI, both TBI and craniotomy animals exhibited greater neurobehavioral dysfunction compared to naïve animals. GFAP, IBA-1, ED1, and FJC immunoreactivity at 19 days post-TBI was significantly higher in brains from TBI animals compared to both craniotomy and naïve animals."

Using a previously described three-dimensional MRI protocol, we measured posterior condylar offset, total condylar height, and articular cartilage thickness at the medial and lateral femoral condyles and compared values to evaluate for potential sex differences.

We focused on microRNA (miR)-210, which plays a wide spectrum of roles comprising mitochondrial metabolism, angiogenesis, DNA repair and cell survival. This study aimed to investigate the effect of intra-articular injection of synthetic miR-210 on the injured meniscus in the avascular zone.",

Four weeks and 12 weeks after the injection, we conducted a histologic evaluation, immunohistochemical evaluation and Real-time PCR analysis. In vitro, the inner meniscus and synovial cells were isolated from rat knee joint, and were transfected with ds miR-210 or control dsRNA. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed.",

In gene expression analysis of the meniscus, the expression of miR-210, Collagen type 2 alpha 1 (Col2a1), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in the miR-210 group was significantly higher than that in the control. At 12 weeks, the intra-articular injection of miR-210 had healed the injured site of the meniscus and had prevented articular cartilage degeneration. In vitro, miR-210 upregulated Col2a1 expression in the meniscus cells and VEGF and FGF2 expression in the synovial cells."

However, in all of previous studies, skin fibroblasts were used as the starting population for reprogramming, raising questions as to whether the pluripotency of the iPS cells was dependent on the particular starting cell type.",
    "Our iPS cell lines were prepared from murine adipose stem cells (ASCs). Their multi-potency was first tested by teratoma formation in nude mice. Then, tetraploid complementation was performed to generate progeny from them.",
    "We succeeded to the birth of viable and fertile adult mice derived entirely from reprogrammed ASC, indicating cell types other than fibroblasts can also be restored to the embryonic level of pluripotency."

Here we compared temporal changes in the cecal microbiome to the effects of formic acid, propionic acid, and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) added to feed and/or drinking water.",
    "Cecal bacterial communities at day of hatch (n = 5 birds), 7d (n = 32), 21d (n = 27), and 42d (n = 36) post-hatch were surveyed using direct 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from each bird in combination with cultivation-based recovery of a Salmonella Typhimurium marker strain and quantitative-PCR targeting Clostridium perfringens. Treatment effects on specific pathogens were generally non-significant. S. Typhimurium introduced by oral gavage at day of hatch was recovered by cultivation from nearly all birds sampled across treatments at 7d and 21d, but by 42d, S. Typhimurium was only recovered from ca. 25% of birds, regardless of treatment. Sequencing data also revealed non-significant treatment effects on genera containing known pathogens and on the cecal microbiome as a whole. In contrast, temporal changes in the cecal microbiome were dramatic, highly significant, and consistent across treatments. At 7d, the cecal community was dominated by three genera (Flavonifractor, Pseudoflavonifractor, and a Lachnospiracea sequence type) that accounted for more than half of sequences. By 21d post-hatch, a single genus (Faecalibacterium) accounted for 23-55% of sequences, and the number of Clostridium 16S rRNA gene copies detected by quantitative-PCR reached a maximum."

    "Palmitate, a saturated fatty acid (FA), is known to induce toxicity and cell death in various types of cells. Resveratrol (RSV) is able to prevent pathogenesis and/or decelerate the progression of a variety of diseases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown a protective effect of RSV on fat accumulation induced by FAs. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has recently been linked to cellular adipogenic responses. To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines.",
    "We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity."

    "Remote renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) following infra-renal aortic occlusion leads to acute kidney injury and systemic inflammation. Hydrogen sulfide is a mediator of IRI and can ameliorate tissue injury in many organ systems. Its role in vascular surgery has yet to be established. We assessed the role of hydrogen sulfide in a rodent model of aortic occlusion.",
    "Wistar rats were divided into sham, control, and treatment groups (n = 6). Inflammation was assessed using a nonrecovery protocol. The infra-renal aorta was cross-clamped for 60 min and animals were reperfused for 120 min. Ten minutes before clamp release, treatment animals received hydrogen sulfide (10, 30, or 50 μg/kg) and control animals received 0.9% saline injected into the retroperitoneum. Renal injury and histology were assessed by a recovery protocol. The procedure was identical to the nonrecovery arm but with a single dose of hydrogen sulfide (30 μg/kg) and animals were recovered for 7 days.",
    "There was no difference in animal weight between the groups (P = 0.337). In the nonrecovery arm, there was a reduction in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in sulfide-treated animals compared with controls (909 ± 98 vs. 607 ± 159 pg/mL; P = 0.0038). There was also a reduction in myeloperoxidase-positive cells in renal tissue in the sulfide-treated animals compared with controls (8 ± 4 vs. 17 ± 9; P = 0.03). There was no difference in histological injury score or endothelin-1 levels. In the recovery arm, there was no difference in renal function, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 levels, or histological injury scores."
