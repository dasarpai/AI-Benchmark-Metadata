This much we pledge. . .and more.\r\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\r\n\r\nwe pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is\r\n\r\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\r\n\r\nDivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\r\n\r\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\r\n\r\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\r\n\r\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\r\n\r\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\r\n\r\nWe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\r\n\r\nBut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\r\n\r\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\r\n\r\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\r\n\r\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\r\n\r\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\r\n\r\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\r\n\r\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\r\n\r\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\r\n\r\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\r\n\r\nit cannot save the few who are rich.\r\nTo our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\r\n\r\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\r\n\r\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\r\n\r\npoverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\r\n\r\nhostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\r\n\r\nto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let\r\n\r\nevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\r\n\r\nof its own house.\r\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .\r\n\r\nour last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\r\n\r\nhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\r\n\r\nof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\r\n\r\ninvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\r\n\r\nand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\r\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\r\n\r\nwe offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\r\n\r\nthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\r\n\r\nby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\r\n\r\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\r\n\r\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\r\n\r\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\r\n\r\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\r\n\r\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind's\r\n\r\nfinal war.\r\nSo let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\r\n\r\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\r\n\r\nLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\r\n\r\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\r\n\r\nthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\r\n\r\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\r\n\r\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\r\n\r\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\r\n\r\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\r\n\r\nof its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the\r\n\r\ndeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\r\n\r\nthe arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners\r\n\r\nof the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to \&quot;undo the heavy burdens. . .\r\n\r\nlet the oppressed go free.\&quot;\r\nAnd if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\r\n\r\nlet both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\r\n\r\nbut a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\r\n\r\nand the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\r\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\r\n\r\nNor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\r\n\r\nnor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\r\n\r\nin our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin.\r\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the\r\n\r\nfinal success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded,\r\n\r\neach generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony\r\n\r\nto its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered\r\n\r\nthe call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\r\n\r\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\r\n\r\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\r\n\r\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\r\n\r\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\r\n\r\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\r\n\r\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\r\n\r\nEast and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\r\n\r\nWill you join in that historic effort?\r\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\r\n\r\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\r\n\r\nfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\r\n\r\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\r\n\r\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\r\n\r\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\r\n\r\nthat fire can truly light the world.\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\r\n\r\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\r\n\r\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\r\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\r\n\r\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\r\n\r\nwhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\r\n\r\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\r\n\r\nthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\r\n\r\nhere on earth God's work must truly be our own.&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;language\&quot;: \&quot;en\&quot;, \&quot;text_id\&quot;: 3, \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;John F.

The brave men, living and dead,\r\n\r\nwho struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power\r\n\r\nto add or detract.  The world will little note, nor long remember,\r\n\r\nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\r\nIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished\r\n\r\nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.\r\n\r\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining\r\n\r\nbefore us ... that from these honored dead we take increased devotion\r\n\r\nto that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ...\r\n\r\nthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ...\r\n\r\nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom ...\r\n\r\nand that government of the people ... by the people ... for the people ...\r\n\r\nshall not perish from this earth.&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;language\&quot;: \&quot;en\&quot;, \&quot;text_id\&quot;: 4, \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\\r\\nGiven November 19, 1863 on the battlefield near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA\&quot;, \&quot;issued\&quot;: \&quot;1973-11-01 00:00:00\&quot;, \&quot;authors\&quot;: \&quot;Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865\&quot;, \&quot;subjects\&quot;: \&quot;Consecration of cemeteries -- Pennsylvania -- Gettysburg; Soldiers' National Cemetery (Gettysburg, Pa.); Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865.

But different\r\n\r\nmen often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\r\n\r\nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\r\n\r\nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\r\n\r\nsentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe question before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\r\n\r\nfreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\r\n\r\nought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\r\n\r\nwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\r\n\r\nwhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\r\n\r\nat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\r\n\r\nas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty\r\n\r\ntoward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\r\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\r\n\r\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\r\n\r\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\r\n\r\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\r\n\r\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\r\n\r\ntemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\r\n\r\nI am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\r\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of\r\n\r\nexperience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\r\n\r\nAnd judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\r\n\r\nof the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with\r\n\r\nwhich  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.\r\n\r\nIs it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?\r\n\r\nTrust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves\r\n\r\nto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\r\n\r\npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\r\n\r\ndarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\r\n\r\nreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\r\n\r\nforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\r\n\r\nsir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\r\n\r\nwhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\r\n\r\nits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\r\n\r\npossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\r\n\r\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\r\n\r\nshe has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\r\n\r\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\r\n\r\nministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\r\n\r\nShall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\r\n\r\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\r\n\r\nsubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\r\n\r\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\r\n\r\nfind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\r\n\r\ndeceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\r\n\r\nthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\r\n\r\nwe have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\r\n\r\nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\r\n\r\nParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\r\n\r\nadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\r\n\r\nand we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\r\n\r\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\r\n\r\nreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free—if\r\n\r\nwe mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\r\n\r\nwe have been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\r\n\r\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\r\n\r\nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\r\n\r\nshall be obtained—we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\r\n\r\nAn appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\r\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\r\n\r\nan adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\r\n\r\nor the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\r\n\r\nguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength by\r\n\r\nirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\r\n\r\nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\r\n\r\nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\r\n\r\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\r\n\r\nThe millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\r\n\r\ncountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\r\n\r\ncan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\r\n\r\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\r\n\r\nraise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\r\n\r\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\r\n\r\nwe have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\r\n\r\nto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\r\n\r\nOur chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\r\n\r\nThe war is inevitable—and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.\r\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace—but\r\n\r\nthere is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\r\n\r\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\r\n\r\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\r\n\r\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\r\n\r\nor peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\r\n\r\nForbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;\r\n\r\nbut as for me, give me liberty or give me death!&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;language\&quot;: \&quot;en\&quot;, \&quot;text_id\&quot;: 6, \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death\&quot;, \&quot;issued\&quot;: \&quot;1976-12-01 00:00:00\&quot;, \&quot;authors\&quot;: \&quot;Henry, Patrick, 1736-1799\&quot;, \&quot;subjects\&quot;: \&quot;Speeches, addresses, etc., American; United States -- Politics and government -- 1775-1783 -- Sources; Virginia -- Politics and government -- 1775-1783 -- Sources\&quot;, \&quot;locc\&quot;: \&quot;E201\&quot;, \&quot;bookshelves\&quot;: \&quot;American Revolutionary War\&quot;}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;TEXT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Mayflower Compact\r\nNovember 11, 1620\r\n[This was November 21, old style calendar] \r\nIn the name of God, Amen.

Then a statement, somewhat in\r\n\r\ndetail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now,\r\n\r\nat the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\r\n\r\nhave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the\r\n\r\ngreat contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the\r\n\r\nenergies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The\r\n\r\nprogress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as\r\n\r\nwell known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust,\r\n\r\nreasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for\r\n\r\nthe future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all\r\n\r\nthoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All\r\n\r\ndreaded it—all sought to avert it. While the inaugural\r\n\r\naddress was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to\r\n\r\nsaving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city\r\n\r\nseeking to destroy it without war—seeking to dissolve the\r\n\r\nUnion, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated\r\n\r\nwar; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation\r\n\r\nsurvive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.\r\n\r\nAnd the war came.\r\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not\r\n\r\ndistributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern\r\n\r\npart of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful\r\n\r\ninterest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of\r\n\r\nthe war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was\r\n\r\nthe object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by\r\n\r\nwar; while the government claimed no right to do more than to\r\n\r\nrestrict the territorial enlargement of it.\r\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\r\n\r\nwhich it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause\r\n\r\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict\r\n\r\nitself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a\r\n\r\nresult less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible,\r\n\r\nand pray to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the\r\n\r\nother. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just\r\n\r\nGod’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of\r\n\r\nother men’s faces; but let us judge not, that we be not\r\n\r\njudged. The prayers of both could not be answered—that of\r\n\r\nneither has been answered fully.\r\nThe Almighty has his own purposes. “Woe unto the world\r\n\r\nbecause of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but\r\n\r\nwoe to that man by whom the offense cometh.” If we shall\r\n\r\nsuppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in\r\n\r\nthe providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\r\n\r\nthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\r\n\r\ngives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to\r\n\r\nthose by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\r\n\r\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a\r\n\r\nliving God always ascribe to him? Fondly do we hope—fervently\r\n\r\ndo we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass\r\n\r\naway. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled\r\n\r\nby the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited\r\n\r\ntoil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\r\n\r\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three\r\n\r\nthousand years ago, so still it must be said, “The judgments\r\n\r\nof the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”\r\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\r\n\r\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to\r\n\r\nfinish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to\r\n\r\ncare for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\r\n\r\nand his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\r\n\r\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;language\&quot;: \&quot;en\&quot;, \&quot;text_id\&quot;: 8, \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address\&quot;, \&quot;issued\&quot;: \&quot;1978-12-01 00:00:00\&quot;, \&quot;authors\&quot;: \&quot;Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865\&quot;, \&quot;subjects\&quot;: \&quot;United States -- Politics and government -- 1861-1865; Presidents -- United States -- Inaugural addresses\&quot;, \&quot;locc\&quot;: \&quot;E456\&quot;, \&quot;bookshelves\&quot;: \&quot;US Civil War\&quot;}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;TEXT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;All of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the\r\n\r\n1970's were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case.

It is found in\r\n\r\nnearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\r\n\r\nI do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\r\n\r\n\&quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\r\n\r\nthe institution of slavery in the States where it exists.  I believe I have\r\n\r\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\&quot;\r\n\r\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\r\n\r\nthat I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\r\n\r\nnever recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\r\n\r\nplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\r\n\r\nthe clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\r\n\&quot;Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\r\n\r\nof the rights of the States, and especially\r\n\r\nthe right of each State to order and control\r\n\r\nits own domestic institutions according to\r\n\r\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\r\n\r\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\r\n\r\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\r\n\r\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\r\n\r\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\r\n\r\nno matter under what pretext,\r\n\r\nas among the gravest of crimes.\&quot;\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r\n\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\r\n\r\nis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\r\n\r\nare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\r\n\r\nI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\r\n\r\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\r\n\r\nto all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause—\r\n\r\nas cheerfully to one section as to another.\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\r\n\r\nfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\r\n\r\nwritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\&quot;No person held to service or labor in one State,\r\n\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r\n\r\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\n\r\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor,\r\n\r\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party\r\n\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\&quot;\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\r\n\r\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\r\n\r\nand the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\r\n\r\nof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution—to\r\n\r\nthis provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\r\n\r\nthen, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\r\n\r\n\&quot;shall be delivered up\&quot;, their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\r\n\r\nwould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\r\n\r\nequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\r\n\r\nthat unanimous oath?\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\r\n\r\nbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\r\n\r\ndifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\r\n\r\nsurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\r\n\r\nby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\r\n\r\ncontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\r\n\r\ncontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\r\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r\n\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\r\n\r\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\r\n\r\nAnd might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\r\n\r\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\r\n\r\n\&quot;the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\n\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?\&quot;\r\nI take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\r\n\r\nand with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\r\n\r\nany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\r\n\r\nparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\r\n\r\nthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\r\n\r\nto conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\r\n\r\nthan to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\r\n\r\nthem held to be unConstitutional.\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\n\r\nunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\r\n\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\r\n\r\nthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\r\n\r\nmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\r\n\r\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\r\n\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\r\n\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\r\n\r\nif not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\r\n\r\nin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\r\n\r\nthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\r\n\r\nendure forever—it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\r\n\r\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.\r\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\r\n\r\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\r\n\r\nbe peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\n\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it—break it, so to speak;\r\n\r\nbut does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition\r\n\r\nthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\r\n\r\nthe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\r\n\r\nAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\r\n\r\nand the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\r\n\r\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\r\n\r\nin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\r\n\r\nand establishing the Constitution was \&quot;TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\&quot;\r\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\r\n\r\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\r\n\r\nhaving lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\r\n\r\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\r\n\r\nto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\r\n\r\nwithin any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\r\n\r\nare insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\r\n\r\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\r\n\r\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\r\n\r\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\r\n\r\nDoing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\r\n\r\nand I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\r\n\r\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\r\n\r\nrequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\r\n\r\nI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\n\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\r\n\r\ndefend and maintain itself.\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r\n\r\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\r\n\r\nThe power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\r\n\r\nthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\r\n\r\nthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\r\n\r\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\r\n\r\nanywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\r\n\r\nshall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\r\n\r\nfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\r\n\r\nobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\r\n\r\nlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\r\n\r\nthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\r\n\r\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\r\n\r\nto forego for the time the uses of such offices.\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\n\r\nof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r\n\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\r\n\r\nand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\n\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\n\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\r\n\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\r\n\r\na hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\r\n\r\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\r\n\r\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\r\n\r\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\r\n\r\nto them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r\n\r\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r\n\r\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\r\n\r\nWill you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\r\n\r\nthat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\r\n\r\nWill you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\r\n\r\nthe real ones you fly from—will you risk the commission of so\r\n\r\nfearful a mistake?\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\r\n\r\ncan be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\r\n\r\nin the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\r\n\r\nmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r\n\r\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\r\n\r\nof the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\r\n\r\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\r\n\r\nit might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution—certainly would if such\r\n\r\na right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\r\n\r\nminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\r\n\r\nand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\r\n\r\ncontroversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\r\n\r\nframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\r\n\r\noccur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\r\n\r\nnor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\r\n\r\nfor all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\r\n\r\nby national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nMay Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\r\n\r\nexpressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not expressly say.\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\r\n\r\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\r\n\r\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\r\n\r\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\r\n\r\nacquiescence on one side or the other.\r\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\r\n\r\nthey make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\r\n\r\nfor a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\r\n\r\na majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\r\n\r\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new\r\n\r\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\r\n\r\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\r\n\r\nAll who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\r\n\r\nexact temper of doing this.\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States\r\n\r\nto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\r\n\r\nand prevent renewed secession?\r\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\r\n\r\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\r\n\r\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\r\n\r\nopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\r\n\r\nWhoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\r\n\r\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\r\n\r\nis wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\r\n\r\nanarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\nI do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\r\n\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\r\n\r\nthat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\r\n\r\nto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\r\n\r\nto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\r\n\r\ndepartments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\r\n\r\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\r\n\r\nfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\r\n\r\nit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\r\n\r\ncan better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\r\n\r\nof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\r\n\r\nis to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\r\n\r\nthe instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\r\n\r\nin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\r\n\r\nhaving to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\r\n\r\nof that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\r\n\r\nthe court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\r\n\r\nto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\r\n\r\ntheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\r\n\r\nto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\r\n\r\nnot to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\r\n\r\nsuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\r\n\r\nperhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\r\n\r\nsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\r\n\r\nThe great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r\n\r\nin both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\r\n\r\ncannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\r\n\r\nAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\r\n\r\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\r\n\r\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\r\n\r\nnow only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\r\n\r\nat all by the other.\r\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r\n\r\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\n\r\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\r\n\r\nthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\r\n\r\nparts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\r\n\r\nface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\r\n\r\nmust continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\r\n\r\nthat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r\n\r\nseparation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\r\n\r\nfriends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\r\n\r\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\r\n\r\nyou cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\r\n\r\nan no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\r\n\r\nas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\r\n\r\nWhenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\r\n\r\ntheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\r\n\r\nto dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\r\n\r\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\r\n\r\nnational Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of\r\n\r\namendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\r\n\r\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed\r\n\r\nin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,\r\n\r\nfavor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people\r\n\r\nto act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode\r\n\r\nseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with\r\n\r\nthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\r\n\r\nreject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\r\n\r\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\r\n\r\nwish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment\r\n\r\nto the Constitution—which amendment, however, I have not seen—has\r\n\r\npassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall\r\n\r\nnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\r\n\r\nincluding that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction\r\n\r\nof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\r\n\r\namendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\r\n\r\nimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express\r\n\r\nand irrevocable.\r\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\r\n\r\nand they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\r\n\r\nseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\r\n\r\nalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\r\n\r\ndo with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,\r\n\r\nas it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,\r\n\r\nto his successor.\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\r\n\r\nof the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?\r\n\r\nIn our present differences is either party without faith of being\r\n\r\nin the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal\r\n\r\ntruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours\r\n\r\nof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,\r\n\r\nby the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.\r\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\r\n\r\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\r\n\r\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little\r\n\r\nto their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain\r\n\r\ntheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\r\n\r\nwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government\r\n\r\nin the short space of four years.\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this\r\n\r\nwhole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\r\n\r\nIf there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step\r\n\r\nwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be\r\n\r\nfrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated\r\n\r\nby it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the\r\n\r\nold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\r\n\r\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration\r\n\r\nwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.\r\n\r\nIf it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\r\n\r\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason\r\n\r\nfor precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\r\n\r\nand a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,\r\n\r\nare still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\r\nIn YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,\r\n\r\nis the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.\r\n\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\r\n\r\nYOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_\r\n\r\nshall have the most solemn one to \&quot;preserve, protect, and defend it.\&quot;\r\nI am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not\r\n\r\nbe enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break\r\n\r\nour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\r\n\r\nevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone\r\n\r\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union\r\n\r\nwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;language\&quot;: \&quot;en\&quot;, \&quot;text_id\&quot;: 9, \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Abraham Lincoln's First Inaugural Address\&quot;, \&quot;issued\&quot;: \&quot;1979-12-01 00:00:00\&quot;, \&quot;authors\&quot;: \&quot;Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865\&quot;, \&quot;subjects\&quot;: \&quot;United States -- Politics and government -- 1861-1865; Presidents -- United States -- Inaugural addresses\&quot;, \&quot;locc\&quot;: \&quot;E456\&quot;, \&quot;bookshelves\&quot;: \&quot;US Civil War\&quot;}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;TEXT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King James Version of the Bible\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Old Testament of the Kin&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;{\\\&quot;language\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;en\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;text_id\\\&quot;: 10, \\\&quot;title\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;The King James Version of the Bible\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;issue&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;TEXT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;cover\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland\\r\\nby Lewis Carroll\\r\\nTHE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITI&quot;},&quot;SOURCE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gutenberg&quot;},&quot;METADATA&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;truncated&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;{\\\&quot;language\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;en\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;text_id\\\&quot;: 11, \\\&quot;title\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;issued\\\&quot;&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:48284,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzA3NCwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL3NlZHRoaC9ndXRlbmJlcmdfZW5nbGlzaCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjY3NCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.WlgitP2GJNCGv-jav0o_78tNnbk2U3jEJ0FQEpsCBHMhU-Dj5EnJf3ERb5kGzI1Zb_ebHK316-09BEupCFBFAA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;sedthh/gutenberg_english&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;63c8889fb9a8a4a29e4a8320&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63c8889fb9a8a4a29e4a8320/bpF6Gei3Aw6riDRm0N1O8.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Richard Nagyfi&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;sedthh&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:7},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or

the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be

consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by

law.

persons or things to be seized. 
V
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime,

unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising

We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . .

symbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal

as well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God

the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century

and three-quarters ago.
The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands

the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.

And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought

are still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man

come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.

We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.
Let the word go forth from this time and place. . .to friend and foe alike. . .

that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. . .

born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace,

proud of our ancient heritage. . .and unwilling to witness or permit the slow

undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed,

and to which we are committed today. . .at home and around the world.
Let every nation know. . .whether it wishes us well or ill. . .

that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,

support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and

the success of liberty.  This much we pledge. . .and more.
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:

we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is

little we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.

Divided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet

a powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.

To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:

we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not

have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.

We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.

But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their

own freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who

foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.

To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe

struggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best

efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period

is required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,

not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,

it cannot save the few who are rich.
To our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .

to convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress

. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of

poverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of

hostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them

to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let

every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master

of its own house.
To that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .

our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war

have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge

of support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for

invective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .

and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,

we offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew

the quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed

by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.

We dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient

beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.

But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from

our present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,

both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing

to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind's

final war.
So let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility

is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.

Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.

Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring

those problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,

formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and

control of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy

other nations under the absolute control of all nations.

Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead

of its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the

deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage

the arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners

of the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to "undo the heavy burdens. . .

let the oppressed go free."
And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .

let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .

but a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .

and the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.

Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .

nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps

in our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin.
In your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the

final success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded,

each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony

to its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered

the call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .

not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .

though embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long

twilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,

patient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:

tyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against

these enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .

East and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?

Will you join in that historic effort?
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted

the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink

from this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us

would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.

The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor

will light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from

that fire can truly light the world.
And so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can

do for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow

citizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,

but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.
Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,

ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice

which we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,

with history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead

the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that

here on earth God's work must truly be our own.</span></div></div>

on the battlefield near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA

Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth

upon this continent a new nation:  conceived in liberty, and

dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether

that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ...

can long endure.  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place

for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate ... we cannot consecrate ...

we cannot hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,

who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power

to add or detract.  The world will little note, nor long remember,

what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished

work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining

before us ... that from these honored dead we take increased devotion

to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ...

that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ...

that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom ...

and that government of the people ... by the people ... for the people ...

shall not perish from this earth.</span></div></div>

Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775.
No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,

of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different

men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it

will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do

opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my

sentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.

The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country.

For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of

freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject

ought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that

we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility

which we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions

at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself

as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty

toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.

We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the

song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part

of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?

Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,

and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their

temporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,

I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of

experience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.

And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct

of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with

which  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.

Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?

Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves

to be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our

petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and

darken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and

reconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that

force must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,

sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to

which kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if

its purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other

possible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of

the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,

she has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.

They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British

ministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?

Shall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.

Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the

subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.

Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we

find which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,

deceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert

the storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;

we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have

implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and

Parliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced

additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;

and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!

In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and

reconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free—if

we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which

we have been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the noble

struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged

ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest

shall be obtained—we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!

An appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!
They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable

an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,

or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British

guard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength by

irresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance

by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until

our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make

a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.

The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a

country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy

can send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.

There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will

raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the

strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,

we have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late

to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!

Our chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!

The war is inevitable—and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace—but

there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps

from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!

Our brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?

What is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,

or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?

Forbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;

but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</span></div></div>

March 4, 1865
Fellow countrymen: At this second appearing to take the oath of

the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended

address than there was at the first. Then a statement, somewhat in

detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now,

at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations

have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the

great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the

energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The

progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as

well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust,

reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for

the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all

thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All

dreaded it—all sought to avert it. While the inaugural

address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to

saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city

seeking to destroy it without war—seeking to dissolve the

Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated

war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation

survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.

And the war came.
One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not

distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern

part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful

interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of

the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was

the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by

war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to

restrict the territorial enlargement of it.
Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration

which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause

of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict

itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a

result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible,

and pray to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the

other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just

God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of

other men’s faces; but let us judge not, that we be not

judged. The prayers of both could not be answered—that of

neither has been answered fully.
The Almighty has his own purposes. “Woe unto the world

because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but

woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.” If we shall

suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in

the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued

through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he

gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to

those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any

departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a

living God always ascribe to him? Fondly do we hope—fervently

do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass

away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled

by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited

toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash

shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three

thousand years ago, so still it must be said, “The judgments

of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”
With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in

the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to

finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to

care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,

and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just

and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.</span></div></div>

Lincoln's First Inaugural Address
March 4, 1861
Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old

as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly

and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution

of the United States, to be taken by the President "before he enters

on the execution of his office."
I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters

of administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.
Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States

that by the accession of a Republican administration their property

and their peace and personal security are to be endangered.

There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.

Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while

existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in

nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.

I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that

"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with

the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.  I believe I have

no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."

Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge

that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had

never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the

platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,

the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:
"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate

of the rights of the States, and especially

the right of each State to order and control

its own domestic institutions according to

its own judgment exclusively, is essential

to that balance of power on which the perfection

and endurance of our political fabric depend,

and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed

force of the soil of any State or Territory,

no matter under what pretext,

as among the gravest of crimes."
I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon

the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case

is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section

are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.

I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the

Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given

to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause—

as cheerfully to one section as to another.
There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives

from service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly

written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:
"No person held to service or labor in one State,

under the laws thereof, escaping into another,

shall in consequence of any law or regulation

therein be discharged from such service or labor,

but shall be delivered up on claim of the party

to whom such service or labor may be due."
It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those

who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;

and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members

of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution—to

this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,

then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause

"shall be delivered up", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they

would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly

equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good

that unanimous oath?
There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should

be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that

difference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be

surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others

by which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be

content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial

controversy as to HOW it shall be kept?
Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of

liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,

so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?

And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the

enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that

"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and

immunities of citizens in the several States?"
I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,

and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by

any hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify

particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest

that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,

to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,

than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having

them held to be unConstitutional.
It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President

under our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different

and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered

the executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through

many perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope

of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional

term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of

the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.
I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,

the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,

if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.

It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision

in its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all

the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will

endure forever—it being impossible to destroy it except by some action

not provided for in the instrument itself.
Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association

of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,

be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?

One party to a contract may violate it—break it, so to speak;

but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?
Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition

that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by

the history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than

the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of

Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the

Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,

and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted

and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation

in 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining

and establishing the Constitution was "TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION."
But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States

be lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,

having lost the vital element of perpetuity.
It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion

can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances

to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,

within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,

are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.
I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,

the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,

as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the

laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.

Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;

and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my

rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the

requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.

I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the

declared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally

defend and maintain itself.
In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there

shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.

The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess

the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect

the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,

there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people

anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,

shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens

from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force

obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict

legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of

these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,

and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better

to forego for the time the uses of such offices.
The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts

of the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that

sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought

and reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current

events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,

and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised

according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and

a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the

restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.
That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy

the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will

neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word

to them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?
Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our

national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,

would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?

Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility

that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?

Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all

the real ones you fly from—will you risk the commission of so

fearful a mistake?
All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights

can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written

in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human

mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.

Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision

of the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a

majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,

it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution—certainly would if such

a right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of

minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations

and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that

controversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be

framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may

occur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,

nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions

for all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered

by national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.

May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not

expressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?

The Constitution does not expressly say.
From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,

and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority

will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.

There is no other alternative; for continuing the government is

acquiescence on one side or the other.
If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,

they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;

for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever

a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.

For instance, why may not any portion of a new

confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,

precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?

All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the

exact temper of doing this.
Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States

to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,

and prevent renewed secession?
Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.

A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,

and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular

opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.

Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.

Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,

is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,

anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.
I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional

questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny

that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties

to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled

to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other

departments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that

such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect

following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that

it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,

can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.

At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy

of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,

is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,

the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties

in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,

having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands

of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon

the court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink

to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of

theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.
One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought

to be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought

not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.

The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the

suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,

perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral

sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.

The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation

in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,

cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases

AFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign

slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,

without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,

now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered

at all by the other.
Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our

respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall

between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of

the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different

parts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain

face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,

must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make

that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after

separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than

friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced

between aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,

you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,

an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions

as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.
This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.

Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise

their CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right

to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact

that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the

national Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of

amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people

over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed

in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,

favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people

to act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode

seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with

the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or

reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen

for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would

wish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment

to the Constitution—which amendment, however, I have not seen—has

passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall

never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,

including that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction

of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular

amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be

implied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express

and irrevocable.
The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,

and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the

separation of the states.  The people themselves can do this

also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to

do with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,

as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,

to his successor.
Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice

of the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?

In our present differences is either party without faith of being

in the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal

truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours

of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,

by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.
By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people

have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;

and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little

to their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain

their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of

wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government

in the short space of four years.
My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this

whole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.

If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step

which you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be

frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated

by it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the

old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,

the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration

will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.

If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the

right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason

for precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,

and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,

are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.
In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,

is the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.

You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.

YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_

shall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend it."
I am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not

be enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break

our bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from

every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone

all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union

when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</span></div></div>

<p><strong>How was the data generated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A crawler (see Open-Assistant repository) downloaded the raw HTML code for 
each eBook based on <strong>Text#</strong> id in the Gutenberg catalogue (if available)</li>
<li>The metadata and the body of text are not clearly separated so an additional
parser attempts to split them, then remove transcriber's notes and e-book 
related information from the body of text (text clearly marked as copyrighted or 
malformed was skipped and not collected)</li>
<li>The body of cleaned TEXT as well as the catalogue METADATA is then saved as
a parquet file, with all columns being strings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Copyright notice:</strong></p>
