for major energy company derailed by ATOM E6xx, EG20T silicon bug\nCustom hardware was developed to us the industrial temperature rated ATOM in a harsh environment. The primary interface to the hardware is the six USB port provided by the EG20T controller hub. All early software/hardware development was tested with the commercial temperature rated ATOM processor and the US15W controller hub without error.\nUSB traffic to the EG20T causes all USB traffic to stop. This issue is stated in Intel Platform Controller Hub EG20T Specification Update Errata # 12.\n\&quot; USB Host: Memory Read Request Address Across DWord Boundary\nMay Cause Incomplete Transfer\nWhen the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register (Packet Hub MEM_BASE+014h) for the USB host is enabled, transfer incompletion may occur if the USB host issues byte or word (16 bit) memory read requests to PCIe and this address is not aligned to a DWord boundary (memory read request address is xxxxxxx0/4/8/Ch).\nWhen transfer incompletion occurs and the invalid transfer continues, the QoS buffer memory of the Intel® PCH EG20T overflows and the system may hang.\nDo not issue memory read requests across a DWord boundary. Since memory read requests across the DWord boundary may be issued by the Windows* 7 standard USB driver, use the Intel® PCH EG20T driver for Windows 7 version 1.2 or later. It may reduce the probability of an incomplete transfer.\nUpon updating the driver to version 1.2 from http://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=4028 http://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=4028 , USB traffic from our devices still causes USB traffic to stop. We have little control over some of our USB device drivers and cannot guarantee that they will not issue a request across a DWord boundary.\nAlternate Workaround that we are visualizing is the following but need some guidance/clarifications:\nThe errata states the problem is caused by the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register for the USB host being enabled.\nQuestion1: Will disabling Pre-Fetching solve the problem? If so, what is the proper procedure to accomplish this?\nWe have seen that the Intel Platform Controller Hub EG20T PHUB Driver Programmer's Guide specifies(in section 6) that the default value for the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register is 0x000ffffa i.e. enabled for the USB Controllers. Section 4.3 states the details of the IOCTLs are located in \&quot;ioh_pcieqos_ioctls.h\&quot; and \&quot;ioh_pcieqos_common.h\&quot; however these files are ...\nHello and Welcome to the Intel® Embedded Community.\nSince you are using Intel® Atom, I want to make you aware of a special place to go with your technical questions.

My microservices depend on communicating with each other and restarting each of them as they download causes all of them to restart multiple times.\nAccording to the documentation, update strategies can only be applied at a service level via labels, but I would like to have all updates downloaded before killing any containers.\nAm I missing something, or is this not currently an option?\nI’d like to confirm the behavior you’re experiencing. Although the update strategies are, as you mention, specified per container, if you’re using the download-then-kill strategy the supervisor downloads all images and then proceeds to kill the services. Refs: the PR ( Wait for images to be ready before moving between releases by pipex · Pull Request #1824 · balena-os/balena-supervisor · GitHub ) and the original issue ( Implement update strategies which take the entire application into acount · Issue #1103 · balena-os/balena-supervisor · GitHub )\nOn your message you mention that the services restart and take some time to stabilize, if I understand correctly. Do some services restart while the rest are still downloading ( which would be unexpected ) or is there any other issue like you want to specify a specific restart order? The later could be solved using the\ndepends_on docker compose feature.\nThank you for bringing this to my attention, most of my devices are running supervisor v12.10.3, which was released before this change was merged.

And finally, can anyone recommend a fantastic place to ship a little known Russian watch off to get a crystal replaced?&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-14/segments/1679296948632.20/warc/CC-MAIN-20230327123514-20230327153514-00038.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-14&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1107,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,107&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://thaissa.me/my-hackatruck-experience?guid=none&amp;deviceId=9c9b268c-f29b-4d9b-aa67-4d2e0c2fa782&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;My Hackatruck Experience\nDuring my last Summer vacation, I had the chance of participating of the Hackatruck, which is a IBM project in partnership with the Eldorado Institute, Apple and Epson. For three weeks, we had a truck full of technologies parked at the PUC-Rio campus and, inside it(!), we had classes about Swift Programming and Entrepreneurship. Also, everyday after the classes, we had talks about some IBM technologies like Bluemix and Watson.\nThe students were divided in groups and each group had to develop a prototype of an app. The theme of my group was education, so we created an app to help people on finding tutors. Our instructors helped us a lot, not only with programming but also with developing our idea for the app.\nThe three weeks passed so fast we didn't feel it! The classes were super engaging and full of challenges. Besides our final project, we also created some mini apps for practice and learned a bit of every aspect of iOS development. Mobile development seems so more understandable to me! Now, I want to learn more and finish the tutor's app.\nImage Credits: hackatruck.com.br/scale/522&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-49/segments/1637964361064.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20211202024322-20211202054322-00103.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2021-49&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1125,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,125&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.italki.com/post/question-93802?hl=en&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Personally I would say something different.

At home, its LibreOffice which has mostly different uses and means I often forget how to do some of the things in LibreOffice that I do without thinking in Microsoft Word. So I thought I’d capture a few of them here, mainly for my benefit but I guess others may find useful.\nParagraph Numbering / Table Of Contents\nBy default, LibreOffice doesn’t number paragraph headings.To set them up, select the main menu [Tools] -> [Outline Numbering...].\nFor each paragraph style you want numbered, select that style in the [Paragraph Style] drop-down, then select the appropriate number style in the [Number] drop down. So far so good. However if you will also be adding a table of contents to your document you MUST put some text in the box labelled [After] – if you don’t, the text and paragraph numbers butt right up against each other like this:\nSwitching Between Portrait and Landscape\nSelect menu [Insert] -> [Manual Break] and in the dialog that pops up tick the [Page Break] radio button AND, in the “Style” box below it, select “Landscape” (which is towards the bottom of the list).\nSwitching back to portrait is the same method except you set the style to “Default”.\nHowever, what if you have modified the default page style to be landscape and you want to switch to portrait mode? The answer is you need to create a new page style. To do this, open the paragraph style dropbox, and select [More...]. This brings up the styles and formatting dialog. Select page styles button (highlighted below), right-click in the list of styles and select new:\nOn the [Organizer] tab, enter a name for your new page style – by default, this will also be set as the [Next Style] and is probably what you want. On the [Page] tab select [Portrait], then click OK. Now when you insert a manual break you can select your ne (portrait) style.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-39/segments/1631780057496.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20210924020020-20210924050020-00067.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2021-39&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1875,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,875&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:9,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;9&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.troposphere.io/forecast/syria/oum-jreiss,2398&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Weather forecast for the next 24 hours\nWe have put together all the relevant information about the weather in Oum Jreïss (Oum Jreïss, Syria) for you at a glance.

Their impact on the distribution of galaxies on very large length scales (i.e. l > 200/ h Mpc) is discussed. The role that symmetries of the de Sitter metric play in determining the form of the power spectrum, bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations is emphasized.\nHost: Fileviez Perez&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-18/segments/1712296817398.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20240419110125-20240419140125-00015.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-18&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:643,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;643&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.bangor.ac.uk/oceansciences/staff/phd-students/rebekah-newstead&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I am studying at the School of Ocean Sciences for a NERC funded PhD investigating the feeding ecology of mesozooplankton from the Amundsen Sea Polynya (AP), Antarctica under the supervision of Dr Stephanie Wilson, Dr Luis Giminez and Dr Simon Creer. Before this I completed a BSc in Marine Biology at Bangor University, graduating with a First Class degree in 2012. My research interests involve marine ecology and biological oceanography, and through my Ph.D, using genetic techniques as a tool investigate the role of biology in ecological function.\nBefore deciding to embark on a research career I was fortunate enough to work as a diving instructor in a handful of warm water, tropical locations. During this time an exposure to marine conservation issues drove me to study Marine Biology at Bangor. And whilst the waters may not be tropical the easy access to the wonderful coastal and mountain landscapes on the doorstep have fulfilled my enjoyment of the outdoors through hiking, fell running and triathlons whilst I have been studying here.\nI am currently working on my PhD investigating the feeding ecology of mesozooplankton from the Amundsen Sea Polynya (AP), Antarctica.\nPolynyas are seasonally recurring areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. They are a foci for energy and nutrient transfer between the atmosphere, the polar surface ocean and the deep sea. The remote Amundsen Sea Polynya is on average, the most productive per m-2 in Antarctica.\nThe mesozooplankton of Antarctic marine ecosystems form an important component of food web dynamics and carbon export. Understanding how the consumption of phytoplankton is divided between the dominant grazers will be important in determining carbon export through the food web and the transport of carbon to depth.\nTo quantify the magnitude of mesozooplankton feeding within the AP gut chlorophyll has been extracted from samples collected during the ASPIRE research cruise. These results are compared with the physical parameters of the polynya system to understand driving factors in mesozooplankton grazing. To further explore food web dynamics I am using next generation sequencing to analyse copepod and krill gut contents. I am using a metabarcoding/ metagenetic approach. DNA is extracted from samples and the DNA barcodes mass amplified before being sent to a next generation Illumina MiSeq sequencer for analysis.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-40/segments/1600400198652.6/warc/CC-MAIN-20200920192131-20200920222131-00772.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2020-40&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2388,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,388&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://next-ventures.nl/resources/news/microsoft-dynamics-partner-roundup-salesforce-nav-integration-automated-wine-broking-with-nav-gp-go-live-crm-gold/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this week's Microsoft Dynamics partner news roundup:\n- DBSync Supports Integration of Salesforce to Dynamics NAV;\n- TVision Technology Automates Atlas Fine Wines' Broking Service;\n- Festiva Development Group Goes Live with Dynamics GP;\n- FMT Consultants Achieves a Microsoft Gold CRM Competency;\nDBSync Supports Integration of Salesforce to Dynamics NAV\nDBSync, a provider of CRM to accounting integration software has announced that it now supports the integration of Salesforce to Microsoft Dynamics NAV, which will eliminate duplicate data entry and replicate data giving all system users up-to-date data.\nSalesforce to Dynamics...&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-43/segments/1570987751039.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20191021020335-20191021043835-00294.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2019-43&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:637,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;637&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:8,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;8&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://diskpocalypse.com/hijackthis-download/need-help-with-hijackthis-scan.php&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Need Help With HijackThis Scan\nAll Rights Reserved.

The activity tab is the one where you will define in a global way the trackers needed for every client. Once done, those will be automatically created with all the new clients.\nA tracker is a part of your activity you are willing to know how much time you spent on it. You can consider a project's step or even a recurring task as a tracker. In Timetrack, you use them to fill your time sheets.\nYou may work on Project, Mission, Worksite, ... So, feel free to modify the \&quot; Project \&quot; term and name it to match perfectly your daily activities.\nIt's also possible to create a pattern which you'll use to define different steps you usually face in those project / mission / worksites. Using a template is a great way to gain time : every time you create a new project using this template, it will get all the defined trackers.\nWorking with such a global management allows you to quickly modify the root of every data using this template. You do not have to make the change on every client you have. On the other hand, nothing prevents you from adding or removing trackers on specific clients or projects.\nThe big advantage of this management is global is that when you make a change, it is reflected on all of your data. You do not have to go back to each client to make the change. On the other hand, nothing prevents you from adding or removing trackers on specific clients or projects.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-21/segments/1620243991685.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20210512070028-20210512100028-00553.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2021-21&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1437,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,437&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://forum.netgate.com/topic/61324/interfaces-widget-bug/3?lang=en-US&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Interfaces Widget bug\nWhy Interfaces Widget only shows \&quot;UP\&quot; interfaces?! :(\nDown interfaces are not shown.\nYes, it show the \&quot;down\&quot; interfaces ;)\n(on pfSense 2.0.x &amp; 2.1 )\ni have installed pfsense on vmware workstation….disabled interfcae is not shown:\nI tested it on virtual box too…same problem :(\nI don´t thinks that a bug, my guess is that it is supposed to be that way.\nUp/down are for interfaces that are in use (enabled).\nIf an interface is disabled it is not in use on the pfsense machine.\nSee it like you have removed the network card from the machine.\nHo can i down an enabled interface in pfsense webconfigurator?\njahonix last edited by\nYou can disable it, thus bringing it down.\nOn each interface's configuration page there's an \&quot;Enable Interface\&quot; checkbox.\nthat's right…but disabled interface isn't shown in interfaces widget\nThere is no function for this at the moment.

Author Kevin Skoglund covers the basic syntax of regular expressions, shows how to create flexible matching patterns, and demonstrates how the regular expression engine parses text to find matches. The course also covers referring back to previous matches with backreferences and creating complex matching patterns with lookaround assertions, and explores the most common applications of regular expressions.\nIn the last movie, we learned about the basic repetition metacharacters, but as you saw with both the asterisk and the plus, they allow for an amount of unlimited repetition. So they allowed us to have this ridiculous example where we had apples with seven Ss after it. Now, we saw how we could deal with if something just had zero or one repetitions, but what if we need some more precision than that? Well, to do that, we need to use quantified repetition, and that's what we're going to learn in this movie. To do that, we need a couple of more metacharacters, and these are the opening and closing curly braces.\nWe'll see how to use them in just a minute. The curly braces are still going to have an effect on the preceding item, exactly the same as the plus, the asterisk, and the question mark did. The syntax for using them is going to be to put an opening curly brace and then minimum, maximum, and the closing curly brace. Now, min and max are not the actual words min and max; they're going to be positive numbers that you're going to drop in there that are going to quantify it for you and tell you how many times this thing should be repeated. Min must always been included.\nIn other words, there must always be a first number there. But it can be 0. If it's possible for something not to exist, well then you can put a 0 in there. Max is optional, and the comma is actually optional as well. Let's take a look at the three possible syntaxes for the ways that you could use this. Let's start with just a basic digit metacharacter shorthand class. So we've got a digit that is repeated, 4,8. That's a minimum of 4 times, a maximum of 8 times. That matches numbers with 4 and 8 digits.\nNow, notice that it's a comma; it's not a hyphen. 4-8, that's not going to work for you. It's got to be a comma in between those. Now, if we only put one thing in there, essentially that min value, well then in that case, minimum also becomes the maximum. And so in that case, it matches something that has exactly 4 digits, that occurs 4 times, not 3, not 5. The last way that you can use it looks a bit odd, and that's where we have a comma still, but this time we've left out the max, and in that case, maximum becomes infinite.\nSo we don't have a character to represent infinite that we can easily just type in there, so instead we just leave the comma in and that lets us differentiate between the one and the line above it. The one above it says match exactly 4 times; the second one says a minimum of 4 times, and infinite maximum. Let's look at a couple of examples. If we have the \\d and we were to have 0 for a minimum, comma, infinite maximum, well then that's the same thing as our star character. It can occur 0 times or an infinite number of times.\nIf we had one comma and left maximum blank, that's the same thing as our plus character. Those are equivalent to doing the same thing. To show you another example, let's say that we wanted to match phone numbers, a very common use case. We could say, well we want three digits, followed by a dash, followed by three digits, followed by a dash, followed by four digits. So we could just as easily write out the \\d all those times, but instead, we're saying, precisely this number of times, repeat it. You don't have to type it out; you can use this quantified repetition as a shorthand.\nIn the last example I have said, all right! Look for bonds which are A or AA bonds, not AAA. Either A has to occur one time or it has to occur two times and that's it. Let's pop over to regexpal and try a few more. To test with, I'm going to open up one of the exercise files here. I have just a Shakespeare sonnet that I've given you. You can use any text really. I just want to have a nice little bit of text that I could paste in here and test it against. So in my regular expression, let's use any word character, so let's just say with a plus sign followed by a space.\nSo it's not finding every word because there's some punctuation in there as well, but it is finding a lot of them. Now, instead of this unlimited repetition here from the plus sign, let's put in our quantified repetition, and let's just put in a 5 to start with. So now when it's done as it's found every series of five characters, followed by an S. That's five-letter words, but it's also words like \&quot;compare\&quot; and \&quot;lovely\&quot; as well, \&quot;darling.\&quot; Those get caught as well because they still qualify. We could of course put an S at the beginning as well, and we'll actually learn a better way to do that a little later.\nFor now, let's just stick with this so we can illustrate the point. Now, let's say that we want to find every set of characters that is either 2,5. So now it finds every minimum of 2 characters that's followed by 5 characters. If I change that to 3 characters, notice that it changed and the word \&quot;do\&quot; for example just became disqualified. Now, since our minimum is 3, do didn't meet that criteria. If we instead take away, take away those and put in 5 again, let's put a comma after 5, now it finds everything that is 5 for infinite.\nLet's go down to 3. Everything that's 3 or longer, those all get counted now. So those are the different syntaxes. Let's try our phone number example. Say we have 555-867-5309, famous old song. And let's put-in \\d and then we're going to have 3 digits and then I'll just copy that, and then a dash. I forgot to copy the backslash. And then a dash, and then this time we need 4. So now we've repeated it each of those times.\nNow obviously you can come up with a much more complicated one that would allow for things outside the US. This is really just for US phone numbers. Let's try our other one. Let's say we had A 1,2 Bonds, and then down here, A Bonds AA Bonds, and AAA Bonds. See, it matches just the last two of that, but not the beginning. If we wanted to say for looking inside of text, maybe we're looking for things that have space in front of them, so then it disqualifies it.\nAnd one last example, let's say that we have a couple of files that we're looking at, and these are the three names of the files. And we want to match any file that has a name, so word characters, unlimited repetition--we don't care how long it is--underscore, followed by 2 to 4 digits. So we're thinking about the year here. That's what it would represent. Like 1997 could be represented as either 2 or 4 digits. Note that it also does allow 3 digits in there. 3 would still be valid, and then a dash and then after that, /d, and we'll put in we're looking for something with another two digits, presumably something like the month.\nSo now, it finds report_1997-04, budget_03-04, but it does not match memo with a long set of numbers, dash, and a long set of numbers. The quantified repetition is keeping that from happening, whereas if we just had our plus sign--there we go--you can see that now it matches all three. So whenever possible, it's a really good practice to try and use quantified repetition. It will help you to find exactly the things you're looking for and not accidentally pick up matches that you didn't mean to catch because you wrote a regular expression that was too permissive.\nThere are currently no FAQs about Using Regular Expressions.\nAccess exercise files from a button right under the course name.\nSearch within course videos and transcripts, and jump right to the results.\nRemove icons showing you already watched videos if you want to start over.\nMake the video wide, narrow, full-screen, or pop the player out of the page into its own window.\nClick on text in the transcript to jump to that spot in the video.

Quantifying the incidence of a global oil price shock in Nigeria: a Roy model with non-homothetic preferences and endogenous transfers (download HERE)\nAbstract. In this paper, I explore the distributional effects of a negative terms-of-trade shock to an oil-exporting country. Specifically, I begin by developing a computable Roy model of the Nigerian economy with non-homothetic preferences, after-tax income effects, and government endogenous transfers through oil subsidies. I then use this model to simulate the impact of the global oil price shock that hits the Nigerian economy in 2016. In doing so, I focus on differential impacts across workers due to their different skills, locations, and comparative advantages. I find that the oil shock led to a reverse Dutch disease characterized by increases of real output, relative wage and labor in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Further, the combination of the shock and subsidies removal affected poor and rich income groups differently, in accordance with their labor specialization patterns across sectors and differences in the consumption bundles they consumed. More precisely, I show that the shock causes aggregate welfare losses that are concentrated in high-income groups, as they tend to specialize in the crude oil and service sectors, the most hit by the shock. Next, using a series of government budget-balancing tax policy counterfactuals, I first show that the removal of the subsidies was the best response to the shock regarding the welfare outcomes of low-income workers. Second, I show that while removing the subsidies, the government can use fiscally neutral progressive tax redistribution schemes to lessen the extent of the welfare losses, particularly on the poor populations. Finally, I show that not accounting for heterogeneity in the expenditure behavior would introduce biases in the magnitude of the welfare changes.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-49/segments/1669446710931.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20221203111902-20221203141902-00342.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2022-49&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1955,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,955&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://defensivetech.blogspot.com/2010/07/little-cracking-tutorial.html&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hey Guys ,\nAfter finishing my exams , i decided to make a little program that asks the user for a valid password to crack it .\nWell , here are the program codes ::>\nWhen you execute the program , and feed it with a wrong guess password , it will give u this message::>\nLet's play more deeper , we will open it within a debugger ( i'm using immunity , but you can use your favorite one ) :\nso instead of jumping to ( Sorry , wrong guess ) , it will jump to ( Nice guess ) and of course all that in the case where we entered a wrong password so the zero flag will be equal to 1 ::>\nPS: You can make a stack overflow in that program by filling the password by a very big number of strings ( more than 500 ) .&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-30/segments/1531676589172.41/warc/CC-MAIN-20180716021858-20180716041858-00469.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2018-30&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:705,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;705&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.soca-valley.com/en/in-search-of-adventure/traditional-events/jestival/news/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;8. 9. 2023\nStarting 8 September 2023, you can explore the culinary offer of selected caterers with six different Jestivals' Menus.\n9. 9. 2022\nOnce again, this year, caterers in Kobarid and the surrounding area invite you to discover the excellent culinary offer in Kobarid and try one of the Jestival menus.\n6. 9. 2022\nSave the date - 1st October 2022\nSubscribe to our mailing list and stay up to date with news about events, offers and travel tips in Soča ValleySubscribe&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-50/segments/1700679100381.14/warc/CC-MAIN-20231202073445-20231202103445-00258.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-50&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:473,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;473&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://skullheart.com/threads/negative-undizzy-from-counter-hit.6888/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it possible to get a visual representation of counterhit negative undizzy like how we get the green for regular undizzy.

I will describe a number of approaches in which we have used Sequential Monte Carlo methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to solve a variety of difficult and challenging inference problems. Very recently, we have also used sampling over variable dimension state spaces to perform automatic model selection. I will present two examples of this, one in the domain of computer vision, the other in mobile robotics. In both cases Rao-Blackwellization was used to integrate out the variable dimension-part of the state space, and hence the sampling was done purely over the (combinatorially large) space of different models.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-34/segments/1534221216718.53/warc/CC-MAIN-20180820160510-20180820180510-00374.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2018-34&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1027,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,027&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/closed-announcement-the-ck2plus-team-was-recruiting-closed.1246218/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;- Mar 5, 2012\nEDIT: We've had many applications and our team has now grown to a comfortable size.\nThis means we are no longer actively hiring.\nGreetings folks of the Paradox modding community,\nas you may know, the venerable CK2Plus mod is currently undergoing a major rewrite. There is currently a small yet dedicated team working on bringing the mod back to prime condition. We are making good progress, but there is still lots of work to do and tasks to tackle.\nThus, we have decided to look for some more people to join the development team.\nMaybe CK2Plus is your favourite mod, and you always wanted to bring your own ideas into it? Maybe you want to try yourself at some major modding, but as part of an experienced team to help you? Or maybe you are an experienced modder already, and want to contribute your skills to a worthy project?\nWhatever your motivations may be, now is your chance to join our ranks\nWhat the CK2 mod is about (a reminder about our design pillars):\nAs the name implies, CK2+ exists to give you more—more content, more choices, more fun. The goal is to offer a deeper and more challenging CK2 experience without straying too far from the original game mechanics or adding overly deterministic events. The purpose of this mod is not historical accuracy (although we try to preserve it whenever it’s not detrimental to gameplay), but rather to enrich the medieval sandbox that CK2 offers.\n- More content. An expanded faction system, an expanded religion system, more events, more traits. Just - a bit more of everything.\n- More challenge. Vanilla is too easy for you? Try CK2+. That doesn't mean we are artificially making the game harder: Remember, fun is most important. But some changes just force you to think a bit more and develop new strategies to achieve your goals.\n- More balance. We believe there shouldn't be obvious good or bad choices, just... choices. This is an ongoing process, and we are always listening for feedback.\nWhat to expect from us:\n- A fun and loyal community (no silly succession demand factions here, instead we have Tradition or Court factions)\n- A motivated team that is aiming to deliver a quality mod\n- A democratic dev team structure that is unlike any government form you have seen in CK2\n- (I think I have some cookies lying around here somewhere... let me see...)\nWhat we expect from you:\n- You have at least some experience in modding a Paradox game (doesn't have to be CK2, they are all similar - we have a former Stellaris modder, for example) and have created some sort of mod/mod edit/submod\n- You have read through most of the relevant wiki pages (especially these ones) and understood them\n- You are either experienced already or committed to learning how to mod CK2\n- You aren't just \&quot;passing by\&quot;, and intend to stay with us for a while\n- Motivation! You love mods &amp; modding, and simply want to make the game better. Motivation is more important than expertise\nDoes that sound tempting to you?\nThen post in this thread, or send me a PM. Don't be shy to ask if you aren't sure yet this is the right project for you, we'll find out\n*you don't get paid, actually.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107894426.63/warc/CC-MAIN-20201027170516-20201027200516-00136.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2020-45&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3138,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3,138&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:27,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;27&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/74658-zero-to-sixty-dp-mature-team-based-pvx/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Guild Name: Zero to Sixty [DP]\nGuild Website: http://60dp.enjin.com/\nIn-Game Contact: Prahl.1057, Rambozo.7245\nFocus: Team-based PvX\nQuick Notes: 60DP focuses on creating a mature environment where players can coordinate teams with people who can be relied on.

In this blog I’ll outline all the things that can be safely cleaned up. The scripts can run on both Powershell (Windows) and Bash (Linux/Mac).\nHubot + ES6 + Promises\nLately we’ve been playing around with ChatOps at Wehkamp. We added a Hubot to our Slack channels to automate some operational jobs. It makes work more fun and way easier. As it is hosted in our own infrastructure, it can interact with our micro-services. In this article I explore how to use ES6 and a Promise to implement a call to a simple web-service.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-43/segments/1570986677964.40/warc/CC-MAIN-20191018055014-20191018082514-00067.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2019-43&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1312,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,312&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:8,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;8&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9735466/how-to-compute-a-line-buffer-with-spatiallinesdataframe&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;i would like to create a buffer around a line-shapefile with wgs84 coordinates.\nI prepared a shapefile with a single line segment and Datum: D_WGS_1984.

However, a user-friendly, reliable, and robust platform to extract color-based statistics and time-series from a large stack of images is still lacking. Here, we present an interactive open-source toolkit, called 'xROI', that facilitate the process time-series extraction and improve the quality of the final data. 'xROI' provides a responsive environment for scientists to interactively a) delineate regions of interest (ROI), b) handle field of view (FOV) shifts, and c) extract and export time series data characterizing image color (i.e. red, green and blue channel digital numbers for the defined ROI). Using 'xROI', user can detect FOV shifts without minimal difficulty. The software gives user the opportunity to readjust the mask files or redraw new ones every time an FOV shift occurs. 'xROI' helps to significantly improve data accuracy and continuity.\n||R (≥ 4.0.0)\n||colourpicker, data.table, graphics, jpeg, lubridate, methods, moments, RCurl, raster, rgdal, rjson, sp, stats, stringr, tiff, utils, shiny, shinyjs\n||knitr, testthat, rmarkdown, shinyBS, shinyAce, shinyTime, shinyFiles, shinydashboard, shinythemes, plotly\n||Bijan Seyednasrollah, Thomas Milliman, Andrew D.

Perhaps I'll get an answer this time.\nI'm still struggling along trying to learn Gtk+ and using 1.2. What I'd\nlike to know is how to kill a child window without killing the parent.\nOr at least I think that's what I need to know.\nI have a main panel with buttons to launch some number of different\nsatellite windows, like a file selecter, and such. I've gotten each of\nthese to work as a stand-alone, and then dropped the main function to\nmake a call-back. Works like a charm. What happens, though, is when I\ngo to close the call-back, it takes the entire application.\nThe delete_event function calls gtk_main_quit() and that works for the\nprototype, but now I'd like to replace that with something that just\ncloses the call-back and leaves the main window intact. In one window I\ncrafted myself (lotsa fields and buttons and spinners and such), I\nsimply commented out the delete-event call from gtk_signal_connect, and\nthough I couldn't close it from a button within the window, when I\nclicked off the desktop frame, it went away without killing the main\npanel. The file selector is straight from the tutorial, however, and I\ndon't know how to change that... clicking off the desktop frame kills\nI'm seeing things like gtk_widget_destroy, but I can't figure out how to\nI've got both Harlow and Pennington, as well as all the html docs I can\nfind, and I'm still lost.

It moves me at a slower rate. It makes me often stagnant in my career.\nThat’s the weakness of wanting to do everything myself. When I start a new project, I do the design myself. I code the program myself. I do the research myself. I talk to the (potential) customers myself.\nAll of this slows me down more often than not. Even to the degree where I would rather learn the tech stack than hiring somebody who does it for me. I’ve hired freelancers to my job sometimes, but those times were usually where I had no choice.\nMy ego is sometimes also too big where I think I can learn the same skill and have similar output. Which actually is rarely the case.\nThis weakness holds me back rather than moving quickly. In today's age, I’m a slowpoke with releasing and monetizing projects.

This function is useful if you need the contents of a match string but not its position in the source string.\nposition is a positive integer indicating the character of source_char where Oracle should begin the search. The default is 1, meaning that Oracle begins the search at the first character of source_char.\nThe following example parse the last name and first from the full name string:\nregexp_substr('Bond,Jame', '[^,]+', 1, 1) last_name, -- first occurrence of non-comma substring\nregexp_substr('Bond,Jame', '[^,]+', 1, 2) first_name -- second occurrence of non-comma substring\nThe following example examines the string, looking for http:// followed by a substring of one or more alphanumeric characters and optionally, a period (.). Oracle searches for a minimum of two occurrences of this substring between http:// and either a slash (/) or the end of the string.\nSelect the second substring of letters that ends with \&quot;thy.\&quot;\nSELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR('healthy, wealthy, and wise','\\w+thy',1,2);\n© 2020 Digcode.com.

Some class, method, and variable names are so bad that they’re funny, but you’ve still seen them in production code. The second part of the session explores practical techniques for working on better naming, including renaming things. Renaming is even harder because it includes naming things plus other hard things. The final section goes back to writing. The next step after finding better names in code is to write better comments in code, which is almost as hard as naming is.\nThe surprising thing about naming things well in code is not that it’s hard, but how easy it is to accept bad names. This is a hard problem that’s worth working on, because although you can’t make the naming problem go away, you can learn to write much better code regardless of which technologies you use.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nHow to Name Things: The Hardest Problem in Programming\nPeter Hilton is a software developer, writer, speaker, trainer, and amateur musician.

I never have been the greatest fan of it since it is only compatible with apache1 and all but after using other control panels I realized how secure and practical cpanel is for a multiple user server and hosting enviorment.\nRead it here http://www.evolution-security.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=291\nShort review of CentOS and Red Hat and how Ubuntu is not gonna push anyone out of the server and enterprise market especially these two.\nFor those using apf on the new kernels and getting ipt_state error, since 2.6.15 they changed the name of them kernel modules and apf does not recognize them. Do not enable monokern as some people suggest, this will screw up your passive ftp and will not work good\nGrSecurity kernel upgrade and patch script. Downloads the 18.104.22.168 kernel and the latest grsecurity patch and then unpacks and patches the kernel, after that it tells you what to do next.\nAfter extenisve testing I have found what I think are the best mod security rules you can have for a basic server with average php scripts.\nIn the last few years on the Internet the price of dedicated servers have went down and more people are beginning to use them for their sites, game servers, or small hosting companies. With this comes as I was talking about in my last article inexperienced admins. Lots of people I spoke too are too intimated by the linux shell and try to administer their server completely from the control panel.\nWalkthrough for compiling and installing grsecurity patched kernel on debian based systems.\nWell I signed up at the site after I seen they posted on of my howtos which I am thankful for. It was the one on the grsecurity patched kernel. I think it should help quite a few people as there are so many local root exploits out now and most distro's security and dev teams are doing nothing about it.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2017-17/segments/1492917120461.7/warc/CC-MAIN-20170423031200-00309-ip-10-145-167-34.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2017-17&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2849,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,849&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:14,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;14&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:51,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://community.retool.com/t/how-to-get-inserted-row-ids-after-batch-insert/3789&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm using Retool to manage data entry for a PostgreSQL DB.

Since there is a many-to-many relationship between products and tags, I need to do a second batch insert in the product_tag table.\nMy initial idea to solve it was to capture the ID of each newly created product (first query) and somehow run a second query –triggered by the success of the first one– in which a second batch insert would take place.

In this week’s deep dive, Anna Filippova from dbt Labs dives into two thought-provoking articles that came out in the past couple of weeks. Using Taylor Brownlow’s “What Will “Analyst 2.0” Look Like?” and Petr Janda’s “Bring data analyst to the table” articles, Filippova talks through: why being an analyst today feels more chaotic than ever; why we systematically devalue analytics and why jobs to be done are more useful to talk about today than job titles; why enabling iterative and collaborative data work should be the next modern data tools hill to die on going into 2022.\nTool of the Week: Hex\nHex describes itself as a \&quot;collaborative data workspace that makes it easy to go from idea to analysis to sharing\&quot;. Personally, I am using it for my side data projects (something I'd previously use Jupyter Notebook for) and am loving it. It just feels so good to work in Hex. One of Hex's killer features is Graph View: automatic lineage of the code in your notebook: Hex detects dependencies between variables and visualizes them as a graph which makes debugging and refactoring a breeze.\nBefore You Go\nIf you work on the codebase long enough...&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-40/segments/1695233506399.24/warc/CC-MAIN-20230922102329-20230922132329-00291.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-40&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1345,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,345&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:53,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/lists/mosquitto-dev/msg00588.html&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;|Re: [mosquitto-dev] Bug connexion...|\nYou should: - subscribe with wrong credentials on a terminal - publish with correct credentials on another terminaland see what happens.

February 7, 2015\nWELCOME TO MY NEW WEBSITE AND BLOG YAAAAAAAY!\nI'm Maggie and I make music for games. I've loved game music since I received my first Game Boy. It never occured to me that I could actually make music for games myself. I still don't really think I can but...I do anyways, because it's fun!\nMy journey in to making game music started about 3 years ago. I heard about and applied for a game making workshop specifically for women with no prior game making experience. It was run by a little group called Dames Making Games. It was their first ever workshop, and I was both pleased and terrified when I was accepted in! Over the course of the workshop, a friend and I created Manic Manatees, a rhythm game built in Stencyl. I wrote the music in Mario Paint. I didn't know what a DAW or MIDI was yet!\nMaking music tapped into a creative vein that I hadn't felt comfortable exploring in a long time, but with the encouragement and support of many in the Toronto game community (special shout out to Henry and Jennie Faber) I decided to continue to pursue music in games.\nSince then I've practiced and learned all I can about making music and working with game developers specifically to make music for games. I've worked really hard and I've been extremely fortunate in many ways. My work can be heard in a number of apps available on both iPhone and Android, as well as on PC/Mac and Ouya!\nI wanted to create a blog supplement to my site for a bunch of reasons:\n- I want to share experiences and tips in the hopes of helping others (and maybe learn something new myself)\n- I want to talk about my musical process and various projects.\n- I want to talk about game music and composers I like.\n- I want to talk about some of the cool things that are going on in my community, things like jams and workshops.\nI have some thoughts about exploring some more technical stuff as well, purely for learning purposes, but let's see if I can write a simple post first, huh?\nIf anyone does end up finding something here helpful, or if you'd like to leave some feedback, a comment, a thought, a question.... please do!

The structure of the URL is as follows.\nThe fields in bold should be replaced with your own information. Your secret API key should be kept private and can be found above. The SAMPLE_ID and DATA fields should be replaced with the data you wish to upload to the X-Centric™ Dashboard. Dynamic user defined data field, and data addition to dashboard via the API coming soon (i.e. within the structured API url, set a datafield equal to some data you wish to upload and have it stored and available in your dashboard immediately, for example: &amp;pH=7&amp;CEC=20 at the end of the query string url would create custom user defined fields of pH and CEC containing 7 and 20 as data within each field respectively). Avoid using the following characters <, >, &amp;, #, and ? as they may cause errors under certain conditions. Limit calls to 1 per second per IP to avoid errors.\nNote that commas (,) are special. Commas inserted between values in your data get parsed and show up in their own cell within the csv you are able to download by clicking the \&quot;Download All Data\&quot; button.\nIn its simplest form, this API can be used to upload data to your X-Centric™ Dashboard via a simple browser. Go ahead, replace the fields in the structured URL with some example data and paste it into a new browser tab. You will see that the data has been instantly added to your Dashboard.\nVisiting the following link will add a sample to your dashboard by the name of \&quot;Enceladus\&quot; with a data field of \&quot;42, X, Test, 3.14\&quot;. When you click the link, check your dashboard and also click the \&quot;Download\&quot; button to see how these comma seperated values are being parsed.\nMore practically, you may also wish to add data to the X-Centric™ dashboard programmatically via any device or sensor capable of connecting to the internet. Programmatically construct a URL conforming to the specified structure and connect to the URL to upload the data. IoT connectivity can be added to your sensors or devices by incorporating GSM, GPRS, WIFI, or other internet enabling modules allowing you to seamlessly add data to the Dashboard from wherever*, whenever.\n*If you are conducting measurements in remote areas where GSM connection is unavailable, consider purchasing an iridium SIM. These issues will be less of a problem once Starlink is operational in your area.\nThe X-Centric™ team is actively developing the Dashboard and mobile application, we would love to hear from you.

The size of the system isn't a great indicator of performance - it's down to the specifics of the implementation. For example, the GNU userland has tended to be quite memory hungry compared to the BSD ones simply because the official GNU coding style favoured lots of dynamic memory allocation over fixed sized data structures or buffers.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-50/segments/1700679100264.9/warc/CC-MAIN-20231201021234-20231201051234-00081.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-50&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:539,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;539&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:63,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://blog.jmoz.co.uk/deploy-git-push-php-silex/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Up until a few days ago I used to use a small bash deployment script to deploy a few simple sites to my live box. The process was a git archive and extract, then an rsync to the live site. Only inspecting it recently I realised that rsync no longer sent just the changes but all of the files, I’d never noticed before as the sites were so small the deploy was over very quickly. The rsync used to work fine before as I would deploy my current working code where the timestamps on files would match the server. Since I started using git at home for dev, the git archive method timestamps the files with the latest commit’s timestamp. This messes up rsync.\nMy use case\nI’ve been working on a very small Silex project which needs to be deployed to my live box so I decided to set up a new deployment method still using git but this time simplified into a git push à la heroku. I trawled through a lot of pages and posts about git deployment looking for the simplest and most effective method that would fit my use case which is as follows:\n- Store Silex app in git\n- Commit on develop branch and use master as the deployment branch\n- Push the code to my live box\n- Run an install script to setup Silex\nSo for my use case of deploying a Silex application using git, here’s the technical breakdown:\n- Set up git to store the Silex app and install Silex using composer. Commit the composer.json and composer.lock files as these are used for the install. Use .gitignore to ignore the vendor/ directory and composer.phar.\n- Set up password-less ssh access to live server.\n- On the live server create a bare git repository where your changes will be pushed.\n- On the live server create a project directory for your code to be checked out to (this is the git working tree of your master branch checked out from the git bare repository from above).\n- Create a post-receive hook in the bare git repository which will checkout the tree to the project directory on a successful push then execute the Silex install script.\n- The install script will do the composer installation, installing Silex and dependencies to vendor/ if it’s not there or updating it if it is already.\n- Add the live server as a git remote.\n- git push to the live server to deploy the code and install the app.\nThis will prevent git from pushing the comparatively large Silex vendor/ directory to the live box, instead we rely on the composer.json and composer.lock files which will install Silex from the live box and make sure the versions are all correct.\nSSH password-less access\nThis simplifies ssh’ing to your live box and is generally a good thing to use. This is my\nHost sagat HostName sagat.foo.co.uk User myuser Port 22 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_key\nLive server git setup\nHere we create the bare git repository and then a directory for the tree to be checked out into:\n$ mkdir /home/myuser/mysilexapp.git &amp;&amp; cd !$ $ git init --bare $ mkdir /home/myuser/mysilexapp\nFor a good explanation of git bare repositories go here.\nGit post-receive hook\nThe post-receive hook is the most important part of this deployment method. The hook executes on a successful\ngit push from a client machine and checks out the tree to our project directory then runs the install script to update Silex. Also of importance is the\nunset GIT_DIR. Without this Silex will not install correctly from your dev machines deploy as when the live box tries to update Silex using composer, composer and some of the dependencies rely on git and so get confused and break.\nMake sure the post-receive hook is executable:\n$ chmod u+x /home/myuser/mysilexapp.git/hooks/post-receive\nThe Silex install script\nI like to store my installation commands for a project in a separate executable bash file:\nThe script needs to\ncd to it’s current location as when you execute the script programatically it will think it’s working from\nGit remote for live server\n$ git remote add live ssh://sagat/home/myuser/mysilexapp.git\nI like to call my remotes by names I recognise like ‘live’ or ‘github’. Git traditionally uses ‘origin’ as the default remote name so if you named it origin a\ngit push would automatically push to the origin server. If you name it otherwise you will have to do a\ngit push live.\nSo with everything setup, here is an example of my deployment process:\njames on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ echo foo > foo james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git add !$ james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git commit -m \&quot;foo\&quot; [master df6c85c] foo 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 6 deletions(-) james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git push live Counting objects: 5, done.

Below you’ll find a variety of labor that I am proud to have had a part in as a UX Strategist. Because of the tap spacing, it will take n/8 to find out if there’s a pixel to replace and, at worst, a full n clock cycles to replace the pixel the place n is the shift register length. It buffers the next eight rows and fills them with pixels seen at the shift register taps whose Y coordinate matches one of the buffer rows.\nThere can also be a row buffer applied. There is a character set ROM and a body buffer RAM.

Sadly, especially during COVID, but pretty much for my entire career, doctors receive an F in this regard. Doctors rarely critically read and understand studies, they often simply are parrots for what their medical societies, drug company protocols, or media pundits spit out. It is said that only about 10% of doctors truly understand the risks and benefits of what they insist patients pursue, while they think they know 90%. That is a dangerous failing, and it has hit hard during COVID.\nMany of our patients ask why we don't use drugs like Paxlovid. It's because we've done our research, because we are inherently skeptical about miracle treatments that have not been adequately tested on a vulnerable population, and it's because there are much more tried and true treatments out there for COVID that have saved hundreds of thousands of lives and that we know do work. Why risk an experimental drug when treatments exist that are known to be safe and effective? Why treat a virus at all when the treatment may well be more dangerous than the virus?\nWe have compiled a Paxlovid fact sheet, that is below. This drug was approved by weak emergency authorization standards in a study conducted by Pfizer that looked at a few dozen patients who fit a certain profile: they are unvaccinated, they are on no other medicines, and they have no other medical problems. In that selective group there was a tiny but measurable benefit to taking the drug, but Paxlovid wasn't compared to other drugs that we know are effective (such as prednisone and Zithromax) nor were the benefits of definite clinical significance. Most importantly, the people this drug was tested on are completely unlike anyone who is reading this blog. Why didn't they test it on real people? Drug companies aren't that dumb. They do small studies first, find out who will be harmed by their drugs, and exclude those people from studies. In the case of paxlovid, this includes anyone who is elderly and on medicine and who has had a vaccine.\nLook, drug companies have a recipe that has worked well for them to convince docs to use their products. First, they scare you, they tell you that unless you take their product you will get sick and die. Second, they test their drugs on small groups of people and then tell everyone to take them, suppressing any information about side effects. Third, they advertise the heck out of the drugs and pay doctors to endorse them. Such is the case with paxlovid.\nWhy do we need expensive anti-viral treatments? After decades of using them for flu (mostly Tamiflu), we know they don't work. They don't make people feel better, they don't prevent hospitalization, and they don't prevent death. And on top of that, they have serious side effects as people age. When we started using anti-virals for COVID, mostly remdesivir, early studies touted great benefit, but reality painted a more grim picture. These IV anti-virals are felt to have killed tens of thousands of people, most of whom are elderly. Imagine going to the hospital with COVID and then being killed by the treatment that the hospital gives you. That's the case with these drugs, and the fact doctors are still using them even in our local hospital is medically negligent.\nPaxlovid is just like remdesivir. Same mechanism of action. Same results. That President Biden and Anthony Fauci had major reactions to Paxlovid and still endorse it, that tens of thousands of people have had reactions and experts are still telling people to take it, is a violation of the Hippocratic Oath. First do no harm. We adhere to that precept at PPC. That's why we don't give Paxlovid.\nIn the elderly, Paxlovid interacts with a huge number of medicines, causing severe drug reactions. It causes recurrent infection and prevents people from eliminating virus. It makes people feel ill. And most importantly, it doesn't work.\nA recent study out of Israel seemed to validate the efficacy of Paxlovid. Many doctors after reading this study (or, more accurately, reading the headlines and the media presentation of the study, because clearly they didn't read the study) told me I had to reconsider my view of this dangerous medicine. The study showed that Paxlovid reduced death by 80% and reduced hospitalization by 70%. You can't argue with those numbers! I mean, wow! But then I did something that my doctor colleagues hadn't done, that virtually no doctors do. I read the article and studied it.\nI wrote about this on a blog in my personal site, but here's the short version:\nThe 80% reduction in death translates into a less impressive actual number: out of 1000 people who received Paxlovid compared to 1000 who didn't, 3 lives were saved. That's a benefit of 0.3%\nThe 70% reduction in hospitalization was even more puny. Out of 10,000 people who took Paxlovid, only 4 hospitalizations were averted. That's a benefit of 0.04%.\nThe study was retrospective; it looked at a group of people hospitalized for COVID and divided those who took Paxlovid from those who didn't. It didn't control for any variables regarding who took Paxlovid (were they younger, healthier, on other drugs that helped them, less likely to die of COVID) and didn't try to figure out if Pavlovid actually helped people or if the people who took Paxlovid were less at risk. This is crucial, since about 80% of retrospective studies are reversed and find just the opposite of their conclusions once more rigorous criteria are applied.\nMost disturbing is that most people who don't take Paxlovid are more ill. That's because Paxlovid can't be given to people who are on certain drugs. Thus, in this study, the group of people who didn't take Paxlovid probably had far more chronic illness (heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, were older, ect) than those who took Paxlovid because the drugs they took for their medical conditions made them unable to take Paxlovid. Hence the 3/1000 people who lived longer likely didn't live longer because they took Paxlovid, but because they had less underlying illness.\nOnce these variables are taken into account, it is very likely that the numbers will reverse and that more people will have died who took Paxlovid than those who didn't.\nAt PPC we are going to wait for someone to conduct a robust prospective randomized trial before we pass out this snake oil to our patients. Why aren't they already conducting such a trial? That's easy! Why should Pfizer do any more research when its compliant medical peons are prescribing billions of dollars of Paxlovid already?\nAs Olser said, don't use medicines unless we're sure they have proven benefit and little risk. Paxlovid is just the opposite. We've treated hundreds of elders with COVID. The outcomes of our patients is substantially better than the national average, and essentially most of the patients we have lost either were end-stage even before COVID hit them, or they went to the hospital and received dangerous medicines like Paxlovid. Our patients do well because we care enough about them to make sure we're not hurting them with our cure.\nOur goal at PPC is to be the filter between the declarations of misled \&quot;experts\&quot; (who often have a conflict of interest with Big Pharma or no academic discipline to actually read studies) and medical truth. Almost always, new poorly studied drugs should be avoided. Paxlovid is one such drug. It is potentially dangerous, interacts with many common medicines, and it's ineffective. We won't let our patients fall into the Paxlovid trap.&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474440.42/warc/CC-MAIN-20240223153350-20240223183350-00789.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2024-10&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7692,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7,692&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:17,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;17&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/130253/java-to-vb-net&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I am an experienced java programmer for many years.

The navigation bar now remains visible and no longer disappears when scrolling up. For the start page I have created my own template, which differs from the normal page setting. Also for the articles (blog, web development) I have created different templates (templates). There will be different navigation bars for specific areas, later once. To implement something like this, I use a so-called page builder. Specifically, the Elementor Pro Page Builder. The disadvantage of such tools is that they always need to be active and need some extra PHP memory for the plugin. If you can arrange with these things, you have a nice tool to build websites faster.\nBut beware. Such a tool is used to build up Internet presences faster, but in my opinion is not for laypeople (even if some advertisements promise this). The basis for Elementor is a suitable theme. For purists there is the “Hello Theme”, I use Astra Pro. So that after Theme Updates not everything I have changed is overwritten, I use a Child Theme from Astra. You can easily create it manually or have it created automatically in the online generator, on the Astra pages. Here, for example, I have defined in functions.php what should and should not be found in a search. In the basic setting, Astra had really shown me everything, such as templates, metas, etc. – But this has now been done with my new “SUCHE” widget.\nTo make all pages appear faster, I used a number of code optimization tools. However, it has been shown that this has repeatedly led to problems with the display of the websites. Now I only use a cache program that generates static pages from the dynamic pages. Especially with many new features on the web pages, however, the cache is deleted. Then, when a user calls the pages, it may take a little longer for the page to appear because it is being recreated. When the new homepage is ready, it will be very rare.\nTo make the web pages appear multilingual, I use the Polylang tool. This mainly organizes me the foreign language functions, such as searching or switching from one language to another. Here, careful attention must be paid to the compatibility of all components with each other. I have also invested a lot of time in terms of data protection and data security. The constantly changing legal situation is problematic. I am therefore considering making the homepage generally accessible via a homepage where the visitor must accept that his activities on the homepage may be used by me or third parties.\nNow it’s painting! The header and footer specify the color space. All currently integrated background photos will be replaced by watercolors later. The topic of “clouds” must now be expanded. One idea is to paint flying objects.

(If I browse for new filters without the plug-in open, all is well.)\nI have noticed that FF closing immediately after clicking the \&quot;Open in Filter Forge\&quot; button on the website is more likely to happen if the file I'm working on has not been saved (ever), if I have more than one file open at the time (especially if more than one has never been saved,) if I've downloaded several filters in one session, if I've opened one to see how it's made but not saved any changes, and if the filter I'm attempting to download is complex.\nHowever, I can't make it happen consistently, in spite of trying to do so for the last two evenings. (I've downloaded a lot of filters, in that time! )\nSo I can't give you a reproducible, I'm sorry. But it's happening fairly often.

Well, I am wrapping up my 3rd project at my company and this one taking sail today is of particular interest. I took on the design of the company web site.\nAbove is the new version while below is the old version. See, when I started here I was supposed to be working with a young guy responsible for the designs they were suing (seen below). I was not keen on the harsh gradients and the blotchy uses of purple. However, keeping the same story was still important.\nIn the above rendition of the project there are some nice dynamic element with RSS feeds into the site as well as a rotating visual menu shown in the bottom quarter. Although I designed the site, coworker William worked with me to make it fully functional.\nThe site works off of a Zend Framework. This is a small Zend project, but I will be posting another one soon that is an online app that I worked on as well. The original designer quit abruptly. My aesthetic obviously deviated from his, but at least management likes it.\nFeel free to tell me what you think!&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-51/segments/1575540482284.9/warc/CC-MAIN-20191205213531-20191206001531-00293.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2019-51&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1115,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,115&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:88,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.thefirearmsforum.com/showpost.php?p=359390&amp;postcount=6&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Welcome to the forums, Berrde...

The key is making sure that all parts of your work bench (including yourself) are at the same electrical potential. You do this by working on a static dissipative mat (http://www.esdmat.com/), wearing an ESD wrist strap (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistatic_wrist_strap). Even though you're wearing a wrist strap it's important that you don't do anything to build up charge on your body. Shuffling your feet on the carpet or sitting on a synthetic fiber chair can both build significant static charge on your body.\nMy electronics work bench is right behind my computer and so it would be convenient to be able to swivel around from computer to work bench on my office chair. The problem for me is that my office chair is upholstered with polyester and builds static charge on my body very quickly. As a result I never use my office chair while working on the electronics bench and switching from computer to project is as a result a pain in the neck. Since I'm often programming an Arduino or other microprocessor I have to switch back and forth quite often.\nThe solution was to fit my chair with a static dissipative surface. My search for ESD safe chair covers brought up a number of very expensive professional options which were well outside of what I wanted to spend and so I turned my attention to making one from scratch.\nI knew the surface needed to be electrically conductive and I first looked into conductive fabrics like this stuff: http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9769. The problem with that stuff is, once again, the price tag. I knew I could do better price-wise. The solution turned out to be space blanket. This stuff is polyester sheet with aluminum vapor deposited on it in a super thin layer. The aluminum layer is conductive and the stuff is super cheap; it was the perfect solution.\nStep 1: Ingredients\n1) Space Blanket. You can get this from camping stores or good hardware stores. You can also pick it up cheap online like from Amazon. Expect to pay around $3 (US) for one.\n2) 18-gauge stranded copper wire, preferably with green insulation (green is always ground in the US). 6 or 8 feet will be fine.\n3) One 500 kilo-ohm resistor. You could just as easily use a 1 mega-ohm or 2 mega-ohm resistor. The purpose of the resistor is to make sure that current doesn't flow from some other part of the project into your seat cover. That wouldn't be nice at all.\n4) Heat shrink tubing\n5) Two alligator clips.\n6) Packing tape (optional)&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368706470197/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516121430-00033-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2584,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,584&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:11,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;11&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:91,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://njpatel.blogspot.com/2008/05/bits-pieces.html&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;- Canonical - The first couple of months have been awesome!

So, I've been trying to remedy this by picking up these projects and starting to work on them once again. The two I'm concentrating on at the moment are Nautilus and Affinity.

Apparently, it’s well put together, but hard to learn. I haven’t tried the Frogpad yet, but have tried several ergonomic keyboards in my quest to help my RSI hands and they do seem to have steep learning curves in common.\nThe problem is we all learned to type with QWERTY keyboards, a setup that was originally invented to force people to type slower in order to keep the mechanical keys from jamming. Unfortunately, there’s nothing ergonomic about the QWERTY layout, and there’s no need to stick to it when using a computer. If you’re thinking about changing to something else (lots of today’s ergonomic keyboards are coming out with alternatives that put the more used keys under the stronger digits, ie. Enter under the thumb instead of the pinkie), you should be prepared for the fact that it will come with a steep learning curve. If you can, try to rent or borrow an ergonomic keyboard before committing to buying it.\nIf you don’t want to learn something new but one something that’s easier on the hands, I recommend the Kinesis Contoured Keyboard, which I’ve had good luck with. Though some keys are hard to get used to (ie. arrows being split and moved), the most used keys are in the same place, just canted a little differently.\nRead the Frogpad review at FrogPad takes time — a lot of time — to master&quot;},&quot;file_path&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-50/segments/1700679100568.68/warc/CC-MAIN-20231205204654-20231205234654-00419.warc.gz&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2023-50&quot;},&quot;file_size_in_byte&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1405,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,405&quot;},&quot;line_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2017/11/09/quick-hack-experiments-with-crosvm/&quot;},&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;code&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;November 09, 2017\nLast week I played a bit with crosvm, a KVM monitor used within Chromium OS for application isolation.

Custom hardware was developed to us the industrial temperature rated ATOM in a harsh environment. The primary interface to the hardware is the six USB port provided by the EG20T controller hub. All early software/hardware development was tested with the commercial temperature rated ATOM processor and the US15W controller hub without error.
USB traffic to the EG20T causes all USB traffic to stop. This issue is stated in Intel Platform Controller Hub EG20T Specification Update Errata # 12.
" USB Host: Memory Read Request Address Across DWord Boundary
May Cause Incomplete Transfer
When the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register (Packet Hub MEM_BASE+014h) for the USB host is enabled, transfer incompletion may occur if the USB host issues byte or word (16 bit) memory read requests to PCIe and this address is not aligned to a DWord boundary (memory read request address is xxxxxxx0/4/8/Ch).
When transfer incompletion occurs and the invalid transfer continues, the QoS buffer memory of the Intel® PCH EG20T overflows and the system may hang.
Do not issue memory read requests across a DWord boundary. Since memory read requests across the DWord boundary may be issued by the Windows* 7 standard USB driver, use the Intel® PCH EG20T driver for Windows 7 version 1.2 or later. It may reduce the probability of an incomplete transfer.
Upon updating the driver to version 1.2 from http://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=4028 http://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=4028 , USB traffic from our devices still causes USB traffic to stop. We have little control over some of our USB device drivers and cannot guarantee that they will not issue a request across a DWord boundary.
Alternate Workaround that we are visualizing is the following but need some guidance/clarifications:
The errata states the problem is caused by the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register for the USB host being enabled.
Question1: Will disabling Pre-Fetching solve the problem? If so, what is the proper procedure to accomplish this?
We have seen that the Intel Platform Controller Hub EG20T PHUB Driver Programmer's Guide specifies(in section 6) that the default value for the Device Read Pre-Fetch Control Register is 0x000ffffa i.e. enabled for the USB Controllers. Section 4.3 states the details of the IOCTLs are located in "ioh_pcieqos_ioctls.h" and "ioh_pcieqos_common.h" however these files are ...

Thanks Felix. We(co-worker) have already requested access to the priviledge access, and I hope it doesn't take the full 10days to get it granted :) as we are at a very critical production stop point in our project for our major customer.
Any pointers from the software intel experts meanwhile can really help us keep rolling if we can be pointed/sent the header files that seem to allow us to re-configure to turn off the pre-fetching mode on the driver (if that can by-pass the existing silicon bug)
On question # 1: We still will like to know from the HW experts who know the EG20T USB to comment if disabling the mode will enable us to by pass the silicon bug all together or not?
On question# 2 We have received the missing driver files. Thanks.</span></div></div>

My microservices depend on communicating with each other and restarting each of them as they download causes all of them to restart multiple times.
According to the documentation, update strategies can only be applied at a service level via labels, but I would like to have all updates downloaded before killing any containers.
Am I missing something, or is this not currently an option?
I’d like to confirm the behavior you’re experiencing. Although the update strategies are, as you mention, specified per container, if you’re using the download-then-kill strategy the supervisor downloads all images and then proceeds to kill the services. Refs: the PR ( Wait for images to be ready before moving between releases by pipex · Pull Request #1824 · balena-os/balena-supervisor · GitHub ) and the original issue ( Implement update strategies which take the entire application into acount · Issue #1103 · balena-os/balena-supervisor · GitHub )
On your message you mention that the services restart and take some time to stabilize, if I understand correctly. Do some services restart while the rest are still downloading ( which would be unexpected ) or is there any other issue like you want to specify a specific restart order? The later could be solved using the
depends_on docker compose feature.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention, most of my devices are running supervisor v12.10.3, which was released before this change was merged. One more reason to upgrade.
Glad it helped. Let us know if you have any further issues!</span></div></div>

Today I eventually went back to my own case to rotate out and found one of my favorite watches, a Strela Poljot, using a shattered crystal. I live alone and no one handles my watches except me. I am befuddled how this might happen.
I recall bumping this up from a few counter edges the past couple of times I wore it, but I’m absolutely sure the crystal was not broken like this the last time I put it in the instance. Anyone heard of a crystal just randomly breaking by itself? My opinion instance is in my bedroom, and it can occasionally get cold during the winter when I’m away for a couple days (possibly 60-ish). And finally, can anyone recommend a fantastic place to ship a little known Russian watch off to get a crystal replaced?</span></div></div>

During my last Summer vacation, I had the chance of participating of the Hackatruck, which is a IBM project in partnership with the Eldorado Institute, Apple and Epson. For three weeks, we had a truck full of technologies parked at the PUC-Rio campus and, inside it(!), we had classes about Swift Programming and Entrepreneurship. Also, everyday after the classes, we had talks about some IBM technologies like Bluemix and Watson.
The students were divided in groups and each group had to develop a prototype of an app. The theme of my group was education, so we created an app to help people on finding tutors. Our instructors helped us a lot, not only with programming but also with developing our idea for the app.
The three weeks passed so fast we didn't feel it! The classes were super engaging and full of challenges. Besides our final project, we also created some mini apps for practice and learned a bit of every aspect of iOS development. Mobile development seems so more understandable to me! Now, I want to learn more and finish the tutor's app.

I would do these things for a few reasons:
1)"experience" is spelled incorrectly.
2) You want to make the sentence parallel, so think about finishing it. "Adults...are able to reason about more things than adolescents are able to reason about." Then you can just take off the end so that it doesn't sound redundant.

At home, its LibreOffice which has mostly different uses and means I often forget how to do some of the things in LibreOffice that I do without thinking in Microsoft Word. So I thought I’d capture a few of them here, mainly for my benefit but I guess others may find useful.
Paragraph Numbering / Table Of Contents
By default, LibreOffice doesn’t number paragraph headings.To set them up, select the main menu [Tools] -> [Outline Numbering...].
For each paragraph style you want numbered, select that style in the [Paragraph Style] drop-down, then select the appropriate number style in the [Number] drop down. So far so good. However if you will also be adding a table of contents to your document you MUST put some text in the box labelled [After] – if you don’t, the text and paragraph numbers butt right up against each other like this:
Switching Between Portrait and Landscape
Select menu [Insert] -> [Manual Break] and in the dialog that pops up tick the [Page Break] radio button AND, in the “Style” box below it, select “Landscape” (which is towards the bottom of the list).
Switching back to portrait is the same method except you set the style to “Default”.
However, what if you have modified the default page style to be landscape and you want to switch to portrait mode? The answer is you need to create a new page style. To do this, open the paragraph style dropbox, and select [More...]. This brings up the styles and formatting dialog. Select page styles button (highlighted below), right-click in the list of styles and select new:
On the [Organizer] tab, enter a name for your new page style – by default, this will also be set as the [Next Style] and is probably what you want. On the [Page] tab select [Portrait], then click OK. Now when you insert a manual break you can select your ne (portrait) style.</span></div></div>

Also, in the Anti XSS library, where do I specify the whitelist?
White lists are always more secure that blacklist - just think which will be more secure, having a list of all of the people who are not allowed to your party or only allowing in those who are. (Basically blacklists can only handle attacks which are obvious or have been used before).

The way people can talk about financial products online is changing thanks to a recent crackdown from ASIC.
On this week's episode of the Friends With Money podcast, Money's Tom Watson sat down with podcaster and blogger, Dave Gow, to talk through the changes and the fallout. They discuss:
- What action ASIC has taken and why it has cracked down
- The impact on financial blogs and podcasts
- What this means for people seeking financial advice online in the long run

Loop induced inflationary non-Gaussianites that give rise to an enhanced galaxy power spectrum at small wave-vectors
Abstract: I outline the calculation of non-Gaussian mass density fluctuations that arise from one-loop Feynman diagrams in a de Sitter background. Their impact on the distribution of galaxies on very large length scales (i.e. l > 200/ h Mpc) is discussed. The role that symmetries of the de Sitter metric play in determining the form of the power spectrum, bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations is emphasized.

Before this I completed a BSc in Marine Biology at Bangor University, graduating with a First Class degree in 2012. My research interests involve marine ecology and biological oceanography, and through my Ph.D, using genetic techniques as a tool investigate the role of biology in ecological function.
Before deciding to embark on a research career I was fortunate enough to work as a diving instructor in a handful of warm water, tropical locations. During this time an exposure to marine conservation issues drove me to study Marine Biology at Bangor. And whilst the waters may not be tropical the easy access to the wonderful coastal and mountain landscapes on the doorstep have fulfilled my enjoyment of the outdoors through hiking, fell running and triathlons whilst I have been studying here.
I am currently working on my PhD investigating the feeding ecology of mesozooplankton from the Amundsen Sea Polynya (AP), Antarctica.
Polynyas are seasonally recurring areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. They are a foci for energy and nutrient transfer between the atmosphere, the polar surface ocean and the deep sea. The remote Amundsen Sea Polynya is on average, the most productive per m-2 in Antarctica.
The mesozooplankton of Antarctic marine ecosystems form an important component of food web dynamics and carbon export. Understanding how the consumption of phytoplankton is divided between the dominant grazers will be important in determining carbon export through the food web and the transport of carbon to depth.
To quantify the magnitude of mesozooplankton feeding within the AP gut chlorophyll has been extracted from samples collected during the ASPIRE research cruise. These results are compared with the physical parameters of the polynya system to understand driving factors in mesozooplankton grazing. To further explore food web dynamics I am using next generation sequencing to analyse copepod and krill gut contents. I am using a metabarcoding/ metagenetic approach. DNA is extracted from samples and the DNA barcodes mass amplified before being sent to a next generation Illumina MiSeq sequencer for analysis.</span></div></div>

Thank you so much for customizing/organizing our band songlist and developing a web interface to manage it. Previously, if we wanted to add or delete a new song to the list, we would have to add it to the main database (which was an excel file at the time), website songlist and printable file verison. Since you made this application for us, we can add a song ONE TIME (or create/delete the songlist genres) in the Songlist Manager web application and it magically shows up in all three locations! Really so much more efficient this way and it is two less occasions for us to have to deal with html/php coding. We appreciate you working on this so expeditiously for us and looking forward to working with you much more in the future.</span></div></div>

The activity tab is the one where you will define in a global way the trackers needed for every client. Once done, those will be automatically created with all the new clients.
A tracker is a part of your activity you are willing to know how much time you spent on it. You can consider a project's step or even a recurring task as a tracker. In Timetrack, you use them to fill your time sheets.
You may work on Project, Mission, Worksite, ... So, feel free to modify the " Project " term and name it to match perfectly your daily activities.
It's also possible to create a pattern which you'll use to define different steps you usually face in those project / mission / worksites. Using a template is a great way to gain time : every time you create a new project using this template, it will get all the defined trackers.
Working with such a global management allows you to quickly modify the root of every data using this template. You do not have to make the change on every client you have. On the other hand, nothing prevents you from adding or removing trackers on specific clients or projects.
The big advantage of this management is global is that when you make a change, it is reflected on all of your data. You do not have to go back to each client to make the change. On the other hand, nothing prevents you from adding or removing trackers on specific clients or projects.</span></div></div>

Why Interfaces Widget only shows "UP" interfaces?! :(
Down interfaces are not shown.
Yes, it show the "down" interfaces ;)
(on pfSense 2.0.x &amp; 2.1 )
i have installed pfsense on vmware workstation….disabled interfcae is not shown:
I tested it on virtual box too…same problem :(
I don´t thinks that a bug, my guess is that it is supposed to be that way.
Up/down are for interfaces that are in use (enabled).
If an interface is disabled it is not in use on the pfsense machine.
See it like you have removed the network card from the machine.
Ho can i down an enabled interface in pfsense webconfigurator?

You can disable it, thus bringing it down.
On each interface's configuration page there's an "Enable Interface" checkbox.
that's right…but disabled interface isn't shown in interfaces widget
There is no function for this at the moment. It would be nice to be able to keep all the interface settings "running" but mark the interface as down. Useful for:
a) A WAN link that is having constant intermittent errors, coming and going, with stuff failing over and back every 5 minutes. Then it can be set to "down" until the hardware/ISP problem is properly resolved.
b) Testing - easy to take down a WAN to test and see how things fail over to other WAN/s.
This is an Open Source project - if you would like it then write it. ;)</span></div></div>

Learn how to find and manipulate text quickly and easily using regular expressions. Author Kevin Skoglund covers the basic syntax of regular expressions, shows how to create flexible matching patterns, and demonstrates how the regular expression engine parses text to find matches. The course also covers referring back to previous matches with backreferences and creating complex matching patterns with lookaround assertions, and explores the most common applications of regular expressions.
In the last movie, we learned about the basic repetition metacharacters, but as you saw with both the asterisk and the plus, they allow for an amount of unlimited repetition. So they allowed us to have this ridiculous example where we had apples with seven Ss after it. Now, we saw how we could deal with if something just had zero or one repetitions, but what if we need some more precision than that? Well, to do that, we need to use quantified repetition, and that's what we're going to learn in this movie. To do that, we need a couple of more metacharacters, and these are the opening and closing curly braces.
We'll see how to use them in just a minute. The curly braces are still going to have an effect on the preceding item, exactly the same as the plus, the asterisk, and the question mark did. The syntax for using them is going to be to put an opening curly brace and then minimum, maximum, and the closing curly brace. Now, min and max are not the actual words min and max; they're going to be positive numbers that you're going to drop in there that are going to quantify it for you and tell you how many times this thing should be repeated. Min must always been included.
In other words, there must always be a first number there. But it can be 0. If it's possible for something not to exist, well then you can put a 0 in there. Max is optional, and the comma is actually optional as well. Let's take a look at the three possible syntaxes for the ways that you could use this. Let's start with just a basic digit metacharacter shorthand class. So we've got a digit that is repeated, 4,8. That's a minimum of 4 times, a maximum of 8 times. That matches numbers with 4 and 8 digits.
Now, notice that it's a comma; it's not a hyphen. 4-8, that's not going to work for you. It's got to be a comma in between those. Now, if we only put one thing in there, essentially that min value, well then in that case, minimum also becomes the maximum. And so in that case, it matches something that has exactly 4 digits, that occurs 4 times, not 3, not 5. The last way that you can use it looks a bit odd, and that's where we have a comma still, but this time we've left out the max, and in that case, maximum becomes infinite.
So we don't have a character to represent infinite that we can easily just type in there, so instead we just leave the comma in and that lets us differentiate between the one and the line above it. The one above it says match exactly 4 times; the second one says a minimum of 4 times, and infinite maximum. Let's look at a couple of examples. If we have the \d and we were to have 0 for a minimum, comma, infinite maximum, well then that's the same thing as our star character. It can occur 0 times or an infinite number of times.
If we had one comma and left maximum blank, that's the same thing as our plus character. Those are equivalent to doing the same thing. To show you another example, let's say that we wanted to match phone numbers, a very common use case. We could say, well we want three digits, followed by a dash, followed by three digits, followed by a dash, followed by four digits. So we could just as easily write out the \d all those times, but instead, we're saying, precisely this number of times, repeat it. You don't have to type it out; you can use this quantified repetition as a shorthand.
In the last example I have said, all right! Look for bonds which are A or AA bonds, not AAA. Either A has to occur one time or it has to occur two times and that's it. Let's pop over to regexpal and try a few more. To test with, I'm going to open up one of the exercise files here. I have just a Shakespeare sonnet that I've given you. You can use any text really. I just want to have a nice little bit of text that I could paste in here and test it against. So in my regular expression, let's use any word character, so let's just say with a plus sign followed by a space.
So it's not finding every word because there's some punctuation in there as well, but it is finding a lot of them. Now, instead of this unlimited repetition here from the plus sign, let's put in our quantified repetition, and let's just put in a 5 to start with. So now when it's done as it's found every series of five characters, followed by an S. That's five-letter words, but it's also words like "compare" and "lovely" as well, "darling." Those get caught as well because they still qualify. We could of course put an S at the beginning as well, and we'll actually learn a better way to do that a little later.
For now, let's just stick with this so we can illustrate the point. Now, let's say that we want to find every set of characters that is either 2,5. So now it finds every minimum of 2 characters that's followed by 5 characters. If I change that to 3 characters, notice that it changed and the word "do" for example just became disqualified. Now, since our minimum is 3, do didn't meet that criteria. If we instead take away, take away those and put in 5 again, let's put a comma after 5, now it finds everything that is 5 for infinite.
Let's go down to 3. Everything that's 3 or longer, those all get counted now. So those are the different syntaxes. Let's try our phone number example. Say we have 555-867-5309, famous old song. And let's put-in \d and then we're going to have 3 digits and then I'll just copy that, and then a dash. I forgot to copy the backslash. And then a dash, and then this time we need 4. So now we've repeated it each of those times.
Now obviously you can come up with a much more complicated one that would allow for things outside the US. This is really just for US phone numbers. Let's try our other one. Let's say we had A 1,2 Bonds, and then down here, A Bonds AA Bonds, and AAA Bonds. See, it matches just the last two of that, but not the beginning. If we wanted to say for looking inside of text, maybe we're looking for things that have space in front of them, so then it disqualifies it.
And one last example, let's say that we have a couple of files that we're looking at, and these are the three names of the files. And we want to match any file that has a name, so word characters, unlimited repetition--we don't care how long it is--underscore, followed by 2 to 4 digits. So we're thinking about the year here. That's what it would represent. Like 1997 could be represented as either 2 or 4 digits. Note that it also does allow 3 digits in there. 3 would still be valid, and then a dash and then after that, /d, and we'll put in we're looking for something with another two digits, presumably something like the month.
So now, it finds report_1997-04, budget_03-04, but it does not match memo with a long set of numbers, dash, and a long set of numbers. The quantified repetition is keeping that from happening, whereas if we just had our plus sign--there we go--you can see that now it matches all three. So whenever possible, it's a really good practice to try and use quantified repetition. It will help you to find exactly the things you're looking for and not accidentally pick up matches that you didn't mean to catch because you wrote a regular expression that was too permissive.

Title. Quantifying the incidence of a global oil price shock in Nigeria: a Roy model with non-homothetic preferences and endogenous transfers (download HERE)
Abstract. In this paper, I explore the distributional effects of a negative terms-of-trade shock to an oil-exporting country. Specifically, I begin by developing a computable Roy model of the Nigerian economy with non-homothetic preferences, after-tax income effects, and government endogenous transfers through oil subsidies. I then use this model to simulate the impact of the global oil price shock that hits the Nigerian economy in 2016. In doing so, I focus on differential impacts across workers due to their different skills, locations, and comparative advantages. I find that the oil shock led to a reverse Dutch disease characterized by increases of real output, relative wage and labor in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Further, the combination of the shock and subsidies removal affected poor and rich income groups differently, in accordance with their labor specialization patterns across sectors and differences in the consumption bundles they consumed. More precisely, I show that the shock causes aggregate welfare losses that are concentrated in high-income groups, as they tend to specialize in the crude oil and service sectors, the most hit by the shock. Next, using a series of government budget-balancing tax policy counterfactuals, I first show that the removal of the subsidies was the best response to the shock regarding the welfare outcomes of low-income workers. Second, I show that while removing the subsidies, the government can use fiscally neutral progressive tax redistribution schemes to lessen the extent of the welfare losses, particularly on the poor populations. Finally, I show that not accounting for heterogeneity in the expenditure behavior would introduce biases in the magnitude of the welfare changes.</span></div></div>

hook.Add( "OnPlayerChat", "GestureMenu_Commands", function( ply, text, team, ded ) if text == string.sub(text, 1, 7) == "/comeon" then
Literally, check on player chat if the player started his message by “/comeon” then do…
But I admit if I add RunConsoleCommand(args) it will still show the command in the chat, right?
How do I hide the message?

Approximate inference by sampling from an appropriately constructed posterior has recently seen a dramatic increase in popularity in both the robotics and computer vision community. I will describe a number of approaches in which we have used Sequential Monte Carlo methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to solve a variety of difficult and challenging inference problems. Very recently, we have also used sampling over variable dimension state spaces to perform automatic model selection. I will present two examples of this, one in the domain of computer vision, the other in mobile robotics. In both cases Rao-Blackwellization was used to integrate out the variable dimension-part of the state space, and hence the sampling was done purely over the (combinatorially large) space of different models.</span></div></div>

EDIT: We've had many applications and our team has now grown to a comfortable size.
This means we are no longer actively hiring.
Greetings folks of the Paradox modding community,
as you may know, the venerable CK2Plus mod is currently undergoing a major rewrite. There is currently a small yet dedicated team working on bringing the mod back to prime condition. We are making good progress, but there is still lots of work to do and tasks to tackle.
Thus, we have decided to look for some more people to join the development team.
Maybe CK2Plus is your favourite mod, and you always wanted to bring your own ideas into it? Maybe you want to try yourself at some major modding, but as part of an experienced team to help you? Or maybe you are an experienced modder already, and want to contribute your skills to a worthy project?
Whatever your motivations may be, now is your chance to join our ranks
What the CK2 mod is about (a reminder about our design pillars):
As the name implies, CK2+ exists to give you more—more content, more choices, more fun. The goal is to offer a deeper and more challenging CK2 experience without straying too far from the original game mechanics or adding overly deterministic events. The purpose of this mod is not historical accuracy (although we try to preserve it whenever it’s not detrimental to gameplay), but rather to enrich the medieval sandbox that CK2 offers.
- More content. An expanded faction system, an expanded religion system, more events, more traits. Just - a bit more of everything.
- More challenge. Vanilla is too easy for you? Try CK2+. That doesn't mean we are artificially making the game harder: Remember, fun is most important. But some changes just force you to think a bit more and develop new strategies to achieve your goals.
- More balance. We believe there shouldn't be obvious good or bad choices, just... choices. This is an ongoing process, and we are always listening for feedback.
What to expect from us:
- A fun and loyal community (no silly succession demand factions here, instead we have Tradition or Court factions)
- A motivated team that is aiming to deliver a quality mod
- A democratic dev team structure that is unlike any government form you have seen in CK2
- (I think I have some cookies lying around here somewhere... let me see...)
What we expect from you:
- You have at least some experience in modding a Paradox game (doesn't have to be CK2, they are all similar - we have a former Stellaris modder, for example) and have created some sort of mod/mod edit/submod
- You have read through most of the relevant wiki pages (especially these ones) and understood them
- You are either experienced already or committed to learning how to mod CK2
- You aren't just "passing by", and intend to stay with us for a while
- Motivation! You love mods &amp; modding, and simply want to make the game better. Motivation is more important than expertise
Does that sound tempting to you?
Then post in this thread, or send me a PM. Don't be shy to ask if you aren't sure yet this is the right project for you, we'll find out
*you don't get paid, actually.</span></div></div>

The main-function uses threads to "split up" whenever it gets a connection but I thought it would be best to have only one connection to the database throughout the whole server.
So that's why the connection should be directly when the server starts up and the connection would be closed when the server dies.
Here is how I connects to the server:
After this I use the "con" variable to create a query and execute the query and so on. So all other files (C++ source code files) just need the variable "con".
How should I design main to make the variable able to all the other files that need to access the database?</span></div></div>

Performance has today degrading significantly however when performing actions such as viewing the logs etc. This isn't ideal for a demonstration, given that a "Show Log" operation now takes approx 5seconds, whereas before it was sub-second response.
The puzzling thing is this performance degradation only seems to have come about after I performed the following actions:
- changed password for one user (myself)
- created a second user
- created a 2nd repository on the server
Note, after changing the password for the user I had issues with certificates, so I cleaned all Tortoise caches.
To attempt to resolve the problem I have :
- cleared all TortoiseSVN Settings-Saved Data including cached authentication data.
- I have also cleared the cached logs
- dropped the new second repository.
To no avail.
Information that might be pertinent:
- One repository.
- Hosted locally.
- Repository security is managed by VisualSVN. Everyone has R/W access.
- Main repository only consists of ~30MB/600 files.
- Repository has only had ~50 revisions.
- Automatically adjust permissions: Enabled
- Use Secure Connection: Enabled
- Server Binding - All IP Addresses
- Certificate is in date
- Authentication is Subversion
- No special logging other than Event Log
Event log shows nothing unusual.
If no response then tomorrow I might try running Process Monitor by Sysinternals</span></div></div>

Slack is fully awesome. At Wehkamp we use it for our internal communication and as a tool for our DevOps. The Slack API allows us to build even more advanced integrations. In this blog I’ll explore how to use the API to create powerful progress indicators by updating a Slack message.
Jump-starting Slack bot projects: bot-zero
To give teams a jump start we’ve created the bot-zero open source project. It solves some setup and development problems. In this blog I’ll show how to get up and running in minutes and I’ll explain some of the choices we’ve made.
Cleaning up the default Hubot Slack installation
If you set up a new Hubot using the Slack Developer Kit for Hubot you’ll get an awesome bot, but with a lot of useless stuff in it. In this blog I’ll outline all the things that can be safely cleaned up. The scripts can run on both Powershell (Windows) and Bash (Linux/Mac).
Hubot + ES6 + Promises
Lately we’ve been playing around with ChatOps at Wehkamp. We added a Hubot to our Slack channels to automate some operational jobs. It makes work more fun and way easier. As it is hosted in our own infrastructure, it can interact with our micro-services. In this article I explore how to use ES6 and a Promise to implement a call to a simple web-service.</span></div></div>

I prepared a shapefile with a single line segment and Datum: D_WGS_1984. After that, i loaded the .shp into R using the 'readOGR' command.
After that i tried the gBuffer method out of the rgeos-package for computing the buffer:
gBuffer(l2, width=1.0, quadsegs=5, capStyle="ROUND", joinStyle="ROUND", mitreLimit=0.01)) Warning: In gBuffer(l2, width = 1, quadsegs = 5, capStyle = "ROUND", joinStyle = "ROUND", : Spatial object is not projected; GEOS expects planar coordinates
Obviously the command has a problem with the coordinates. I tried some approaches, but didn't find a solution.
Another example i found for a buffer around points was the following, but i'm not sure how to use it in my case: http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/compute-buffer-from-point-shapefile-to-have-shapefile-td4574666.html
Best regards, Stefan
Reduced to the relevant part, here is the code:
require("rgeos") require("rgdal") l2=readOGR(dsn="C:/Maps", layer="osm_ms") proj4string(l2) &lt;- CRS("+proj=longlat") l2.trans &lt;- spTransform(l2, CRS("+proj=longlat")) summary(l2.trans) > Object of class SpatialLinesDataFrame > Coordinates: > min max > x 7.478942 7.772171 > y 51.840318 52.058856 > Is projected: FALSE > proj4string : [+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84] > Data attributes: plot(l2.trans) plot(gBuffer(l2.trans, width=1.0, quadsegs=5, capStyle="ROUND", joinStyle="ROUND", mitreLimit=0.01))
Probably the line:
Is projected: FALSE is the reason for the problem, but i'm not sure how to use the spTranform and how to find the correct projection.</span></div></div>

Data from Digital Repeat Photography Images
Digital repeat photography and near-surface remote sensing have been used by environmental scientists to study the environmental change for nearly a decade. However, a user-friendly, reliable, and robust platform to extract color-based statistics and time-series from a large stack of images is still lacking. Here, we present an interactive open-source toolkit, called 'xROI', that facilitate the process time-series extraction and improve the quality of the final data. 'xROI' provides a responsive environment for scientists to interactively a) delineate regions of interest (ROI), b) handle field of view (FOV) shifts, and c) extract and export time series data characterizing image color (i.e. red, green and blue channel digital numbers for the defined ROI). Using 'xROI', user can detect FOV shifts without minimal difficulty. The software gives user the opportunity to readjust the mask files or redraw new ones every time an FOV shift occurs. 'xROI' helps to significantly improve data accuracy and continuity.

This will be my third post here. Perhaps I'll get an answer this time.
I'm still struggling along trying to learn Gtk+ and using 1.2. What I'd
like to know is how to kill a child window without killing the parent.
Or at least I think that's what I need to know.
I have a main panel with buttons to launch some number of different
satellite windows, like a file selecter, and such. I've gotten each of
these to work as a stand-alone, and then dropped the main function to
make a call-back. Works like a charm. What happens, though, is when I
go to close the call-back, it takes the entire application.
The delete_event function calls gtk_main_quit() and that works for the
prototype, but now I'd like to replace that with something that just
closes the call-back and leaves the main window intact. In one window I
crafted myself (lotsa fields and buttons and spinners and such), I
simply commented out the delete-event call from gtk_signal_connect, and
though I couldn't close it from a button within the window, when I
clicked off the desktop frame, it went away without killing the main
panel. The file selector is straight from the tutorial, however, and I
don't know how to change that... clicking off the desktop frame kills
I'm seeing things like gtk_widget_destroy, but I can't figure out how to
I've got both Harlow and Pennington, as well as all the html docs I can
find, and I'm still lost. Would someone point me in the right direction

We find a Z2 bulk topological invariant protecting the corner modes. Our work establishes that there exist topological phases protected by symmetries impossible in a crystal.

That’s the weakness of wanting to do everything myself. When I start a new project, I do the design myself. I code the program myself. I do the research myself. I talk to the (potential) customers myself.
All of this slows me down more often than not. Even to the degree where I would rather learn the tech stack than hiring somebody who does it for me. I’ve hired freelancers to my job sometimes, but those times were usually where I had no choice.
My ego is sometimes also too big where I think I can learn the same skill and have similar output. Which actually is rarely the case.
This weakness holds me back rather than moving quickly. In today's age, I’m a slowpoke with releasing and monetizing projects. I have to reflect if I want to go faster.
Or need to go faster.</span></div></div>

It is also similar to REGEXP_INSTR, but instead of returning the position of the substring, it returns the substring itself. This function is useful if you need the contents of a match string but not its position in the source string.
position is a positive integer indicating the character of source_char where Oracle should begin the search. The default is 1, meaning that Oracle begins the search at the first character of source_char.
The following example parse the last name and first from the full name string:
regexp_substr('Bond,Jame', '[^,]+', 1, 1) last_name, -- first occurrence of non-comma substring
regexp_substr('Bond,Jame', '[^,]+', 1, 2) first_name -- second occurrence of non-comma substring
The following example examines the string, looking for http:// followed by a substring of one or more alphanumeric characters and optionally, a period (.). Oracle searches for a minimum of two occurrences of this substring between http:// and either a slash (/) or the end of the string.
Select the second substring of letters that ends with "thy."
SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR('healthy, wealthy, and wise','\w+thy',1,2);

You will explore the similarities between writing and coding, and uses writers’ advice to identify different kinds of avoidable bad naming in code. Some class, method, and variable names are so bad that they’re funny, but you’ve still seen them in production code. The second part of the session explores practical techniques for working on better naming, including renaming things. Renaming is even harder because it includes naming things plus other hard things. The final section goes back to writing. The next step after finding better names in code is to write better comments in code, which is almost as hard as naming is.
The surprising thing about naming things well in code is not that it’s hard, but how easy it is to accept bad names. This is a hard problem that’s worth working on, because although you can’t make the naming problem go away, you can learn to write much better code regardless of which technologies you use.

After a lil work getting the config right for s hosting/shell server I finally came up with the script that will patch, compile, and install the gresecurity patched kernel. You just run the shell script and it will download the kernel and patch, patch the kernel, download the config, and then compile and install.
The config I got made up is for Pentium4/Xeon/Celeron based servers.
The last few months I have been using a server for security research, kernel testing, mod security rules testing, firewalls, dos protection, you name it. As well as to host my ircd and site. We basically have the server for development and testing although it is ran just like any other hosting server. In order to do the research we do we must keep a server.
This is a short review I wanted to write about cpanel. I never have been the greatest fan of it since it is only compatible with apache1 and all but after using other control panels I realized how secure and practical cpanel is for a multiple user server and hosting enviorment.

Short review of CentOS and Red Hat and how Ubuntu is not gonna push anyone out of the server and enterprise market especially these two.
For those using apf on the new kernels and getting ipt_state error, since 2.6.15 they changed the name of them kernel modules and apf does not recognize them. Do not enable monokern as some people suggest, this will screw up your passive ftp and will not work good
GrSecurity kernel upgrade and patch script. Downloads the 18.104.22.168 kernel and the latest grsecurity patch and then unpacks and patches the kernel, after that it tells you what to do next.
After extenisve testing I have found what I think are the best mod security rules you can have for a basic server with average php scripts.
In the last few years on the Internet the price of dedicated servers have went down and more people are beginning to use them for their sites, game servers, or small hosting companies. With this comes as I was talking about in my last article inexperienced admins. Lots of people I spoke too are too intimated by the linux shell and try to administer their server completely from the control panel.
Walkthrough for compiling and installing grsecurity patched kernel on debian based systems.
Well I signed up at the site after I seen they posted on of my howtos which I am thankful for. It was the one on the grsecurity patched kernel. I think it should help quite a few people as there are so many local root exploits out now and most distro's security and dev teams are doing nothing about it.</span></div></div>

I've been struggling when trying to achieve the following:
- Create rows (batch insert) for all products in the form upon submission
- Tag those new products. Since there is a many-to-many relationship between products and tags, I need to do a second batch insert in the product_tag table.
My initial idea to solve it was to capture the ID of each newly created product (first query) and somehow run a second query –triggered by the success of the first one– in which a second batch insert would take place. However, I seem unable to access the set of newly created product ids from the first query.

An Interesting Read: Iterating on your data team
If you’re not already subscribed to the Analytics Engineering Roundup newsletter, you should go fix that now. In this week’s deep dive, Anna Filippova from dbt Labs dives into two thought-provoking articles that came out in the past couple of weeks. Using Taylor Brownlow’s “What Will “Analyst 2.0” Look Like?” and Petr Janda’s “Bring data analyst to the table” articles, Filippova talks through: why being an analyst today feels more chaotic than ever; why we systematically devalue analytics and why jobs to be done are more useful to talk about today than job titles; why enabling iterative and collaborative data work should be the next modern data tools hill to die on going into 2022.
Tool of the Week: Hex
Hex describes itself as a "collaborative data workspace that makes it easy to go from idea to analysis to sharing". Personally, I am using it for my side data projects (something I'd previously use Jupyter Notebook for) and am loving it. It just feels so good to work in Hex. One of Hex's killer features is Graph View: automatic lineage of the code in your notebook: Hex detects dependencies between variables and visualizes them as a graph which makes debugging and refactoring a breeze.

You should: - subscribe with wrong credentials on a terminal - publish with correct credentials on another terminaland see what happens. I realized weeks ago that mosquitto_sub "seems" to subscribe using TLS and wrong credentials, gives no error while it's actually continuously trying and failing (using more verbosity reveals this).

When we generate our primary layout (FlashHelp), the index works fine until we post on our Intranet. Once it's posted, we link to the htm file and if you click on Index and then click on a keyword, the results are duplicated and sometimes they repeat 3 times (see screenshot below). When we test this on a local PC or laptop, there are no repeat results. Any suggestions on what to check to resolve this?
Your image suggests that the index term is linked to two topics that may be titled identically. Have you scrutinized the index term carefully to ensure this isn't the case?
I suppose it's also possible that you have somehow managed to merge systems in a manner where the same topic (or topics) are listed more than once.
Helpful and Handy Links
Thanks for your reply. This issue in the index happens with every term that has more than one topic associated with it. It doesn't happen when you first click on the index and then a term. It takes a few clicks and then the duplicates start showing.
We re-created the index and checked that there are no topics with the same name. This only happens when it's online. It does not happen on a local computer. I'm not sure what else to try at this point. Any other thoughts or suggestions?</span></div></div>

WELCOME TO MY NEW WEBSITE AND BLOG YAAAAAAAY!
I'm Maggie and I make music for games. I've loved game music since I received my first Game Boy. It never occured to me that I could actually make music for games myself. I still don't really think I can but...I do anyways, because it's fun!
My journey in to making game music started about 3 years ago. I heard about and applied for a game making workshop specifically for women with no prior game making experience. It was run by a little group called Dames Making Games. It was their first ever workshop, and I was both pleased and terrified when I was accepted in! Over the course of the workshop, a friend and I created Manic Manatees, a rhythm game built in Stencyl. I wrote the music in Mario Paint. I didn't know what a DAW or MIDI was yet!
Making music tapped into a creative vein that I hadn't felt comfortable exploring in a long time, but with the encouragement and support of many in the Toronto game community (special shout out to Henry and Jennie Faber) I decided to continue to pursue music in games.
Since then I've practiced and learned all I can about making music and working with game developers specifically to make music for games. I've worked really hard and I've been extremely fortunate in many ways. My work can be heard in a number of apps available on both iPhone and Android, as well as on PC/Mac and Ouya!
I wanted to create a blog supplement to my site for a bunch of reasons:
- I want to share experiences and tips in the hopes of helping others (and maybe learn something new myself)
- I want to talk about my musical process and various projects.
- I want to talk about game music and composers I like.
- I want to talk about some of the cool things that are going on in my community, things like jams and workshops.
I have some thoughts about exploring some more technical stuff as well, purely for learning purposes, but let's see if I can write a simple post first, huh?
If anyone does end up finding something here helpful, or if you'd like to leave some feedback, a comment, a thought, a question.... please do! Email me at email@example.com or tweet at me, @mjnmclean !</span></div></div>

Your unique secret API key is:
Keep this private.
Mobile App Instructions
When you take a measurement via the mobile application, the data is auto-magically and immediately available in your X-Centric™ Dashboard!
MQTT protocol Instructions
The X-Centric™ data management system is MQTT enabled. You can connect to the X-Centric™ broker at
on default port 1883.
Your username and password are your API key and your private stream is only available to you. SSL port 8883 coming soon. More instructions and tutorials will be added but fyi X-Centric™ is operating a fully functioning MQTT broker which publishes data uploaded to the dashboard from the mobile app or api to a private stream.
You can receive all published data by subscribing to
You can receive specific data by subscribing to
If you would like to add data to your X-Centric™ Dashboard via the API, all you have to do is access a formatted URL. The structure of the URL is as follows.
The fields in bold should be replaced with your own information. Your secret API key should be kept private and can be found above. The SAMPLE_ID and DATA fields should be replaced with the data you wish to upload to the X-Centric™ Dashboard. Dynamic user defined data field, and data addition to dashboard via the API coming soon (i.e. within the structured API url, set a datafield equal to some data you wish to upload and have it stored and available in your dashboard immediately, for example: &amp;pH=7&amp;CEC=20 at the end of the query string url would create custom user defined fields of pH and CEC containing 7 and 20 as data within each field respectively). Avoid using the following characters &lt;, >, &amp;, #, and ? as they may cause errors under certain conditions. Limit calls to 1 per second per IP to avoid errors.
Note that commas (,) are special. Commas inserted between values in your data get parsed and show up in their own cell within the csv you are able to download by clicking the "Download All Data" button.
In its simplest form, this API can be used to upload data to your X-Centric™ Dashboard via a simple browser. Go ahead, replace the fields in the structured URL with some example data and paste it into a new browser tab. You will see that the data has been instantly added to your Dashboard.
Visiting the following link will add a sample to your dashboard by the name of "Enceladus" with a data field of "42, X, Test, 3.14". When you click the link, check your dashboard and also click the "Download" button to see how these comma seperated values are being parsed.
More practically, you may also wish to add data to the X-Centric™ dashboard programmatically via any device or sensor capable of connecting to the internet. Programmatically construct a URL conforming to the specified structure and connect to the URL to upload the data. IoT connectivity can be added to your sensors or devices by incorporating GSM, GPRS, WIFI, or other internet enabling modules allowing you to seamlessly add data to the Dashboard from wherever*, whenever.
*If you are conducting measurements in remote areas where GSM connection is unavailable, consider purchasing an iridium SIM. These issues will be less of a problem once Starlink is operational in your area.
The X-Centric™ team is actively developing the Dashboard and mobile application, we would love to hear from you. If you have any questions, concerns or feature requests please reach out to us via email at [email protected]
Happy Sciencing Explorer!

"I run Debian and OpenBSD"
I left out OpenBSD in my comment since it's not very performant compared to Net and Free, which have had a lot more focus on performance. The size of the system isn't a great indicator of performance - it's down to the specifics of the implementation. For example, the GNU userland has tended to be quite memory hungry compared to the BSD ones simply because the official GNU coding style favoured lots of dynamic memory allocation over fixed sized data structures or buffers.</span></div></div>

The process was a git archive and extract, then an rsync to the live site. Only inspecting it recently I realised that rsync no longer sent just the changes but all of the files, I’d never noticed before as the sites were so small the deploy was over very quickly. The rsync used to work fine before as I would deploy my current working code where the timestamps on files would match the server. Since I started using git at home for dev, the git archive method timestamps the files with the latest commit’s timestamp. This messes up rsync.
My use case
I’ve been working on a very small Silex project which needs to be deployed to my live box so I decided to set up a new deployment method still using git but this time simplified into a git push à la heroku. I trawled through a lot of pages and posts about git deployment looking for the simplest and most effective method that would fit my use case which is as follows:
- Store Silex app in git
- Commit on develop branch and use master as the deployment branch
- Push the code to my live box
- Run an install script to setup Silex
So for my use case of deploying a Silex application using git, here’s the technical breakdown:
- Set up git to store the Silex app and install Silex using composer. Commit the composer.json and composer.lock files as these are used for the install. Use .gitignore to ignore the vendor/ directory and composer.phar.
- Set up password-less ssh access to live server.
- On the live server create a bare git repository where your changes will be pushed.
- On the live server create a project directory for your code to be checked out to (this is the git working tree of your master branch checked out from the git bare repository from above).
- Create a post-receive hook in the bare git repository which will checkout the tree to the project directory on a successful push then execute the Silex install script.
- The install script will do the composer installation, installing Silex and dependencies to vendor/ if it’s not there or updating it if it is already.
- Add the live server as a git remote.
- git push to the live server to deploy the code and install the app.
This will prevent git from pushing the comparatively large Silex vendor/ directory to the live box, instead we rely on the composer.json and composer.lock files which will install Silex from the live box and make sure the versions are all correct.
SSH password-less access
This simplifies ssh’ing to your live box and is generally a good thing to use. This is my
Host sagat HostName sagat.foo.co.uk User myuser Port 22 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_key
Live server git setup
Here we create the bare git repository and then a directory for the tree to be checked out into:
$ mkdir /home/myuser/mysilexapp.git &amp;&amp; cd !$ $ git init --bare $ mkdir /home/myuser/mysilexapp
For a good explanation of git bare repositories go here.
Git post-receive hook
The post-receive hook is the most important part of this deployment method. The hook executes on a successful
git push from a client machine and checks out the tree to our project directory then runs the install script to update Silex. Also of importance is the
unset GIT_DIR. Without this Silex will not install correctly from your dev machines deploy as when the live box tries to update Silex using composer, composer and some of the dependencies rely on git and so get confused and break.
Make sure the post-receive hook is executable:
$ chmod u+x /home/myuser/mysilexapp.git/hooks/post-receive
The Silex install script
I like to store my installation commands for a project in a separate executable bash file:
The script needs to
cd to it’s current location as when you execute the script programatically it will think it’s working from
Git remote for live server
$ git remote add live ssh://sagat/home/myuser/mysilexapp.git
I like to call my remotes by names I recognise like ‘live’ or ‘github’. Git traditionally uses ‘origin’ as the default remote name so if you named it origin a
git push would automatically push to the origin server. If you name it otherwise you will have to do a
git push live.
So with everything setup, here is an example of my deployment process:
james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ echo foo > foo james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git add !$ james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git commit -m "foo" [master df6c85c] foo 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 6 deletions(-) james on moz-air in ~/code/mysilexapp (master) $ git push live Counting objects: 5, done.

Sadly, especially during COVID, but pretty much for my entire career, doctors receive an F in this regard. Doctors rarely critically read and understand studies, they often simply are parrots for what their medical societies, drug company protocols, or media pundits spit out. It is said that only about 10% of doctors truly understand the risks and benefits of what they insist patients pursue, while they think they know 90%. That is a dangerous failing, and it has hit hard during COVID.
Many of our patients ask why we don't use drugs like Paxlovid. It's because we've done our research, because we are inherently skeptical about miracle treatments that have not been adequately tested on a vulnerable population, and it's because there are much more tried and true treatments out there for COVID that have saved hundreds of thousands of lives and that we know do work. Why risk an experimental drug when treatments exist that are known to be safe and effective? Why treat a virus at all when the treatment may well be more dangerous than the virus?
We have compiled a Paxlovid fact sheet, that is below. This drug was approved by weak emergency authorization standards in a study conducted by Pfizer that looked at a few dozen patients who fit a certain profile: they are unvaccinated, they are on no other medicines, and they have no other medical problems. In that selective group there was a tiny but measurable benefit to taking the drug, but Paxlovid wasn't compared to other drugs that we know are effective (such as prednisone and Zithromax) nor were the benefits of definite clinical significance. Most importantly, the people this drug was tested on are completely unlike anyone who is reading this blog. Why didn't they test it on real people? Drug companies aren't that dumb. They do small studies first, find out who will be harmed by their drugs, and exclude those people from studies. In the case of paxlovid, this includes anyone who is elderly and on medicine and who has had a vaccine.
Look, drug companies have a recipe that has worked well for them to convince docs to use their products. First, they scare you, they tell you that unless you take their product you will get sick and die. Second, they test their drugs on small groups of people and then tell everyone to take them, suppressing any information about side effects. Third, they advertise the heck out of the drugs and pay doctors to endorse them. Such is the case with paxlovid.
Why do we need expensive anti-viral treatments? After decades of using them for flu (mostly Tamiflu), we know they don't work. They don't make people feel better, they don't prevent hospitalization, and they don't prevent death. And on top of that, they have serious side effects as people age. When we started using anti-virals for COVID, mostly remdesivir, early studies touted great benefit, but reality painted a more grim picture. These IV anti-virals are felt to have killed tens of thousands of people, most of whom are elderly. Imagine going to the hospital with COVID and then being killed by the treatment that the hospital gives you. That's the case with these drugs, and the fact doctors are still using them even in our local hospital is medically negligent.
Paxlovid is just like remdesivir. Same mechanism of action. Same results. That President Biden and Anthony Fauci had major reactions to Paxlovid and still endorse it, that tens of thousands of people have had reactions and experts are still telling people to take it, is a violation of the Hippocratic Oath. First do no harm. We adhere to that precept at PPC. That's why we don't give Paxlovid.
In the elderly, Paxlovid interacts with a huge number of medicines, causing severe drug reactions. It causes recurrent infection and prevents people from eliminating virus. It makes people feel ill. And most importantly, it doesn't work.
A recent study out of Israel seemed to validate the efficacy of Paxlovid. Many doctors after reading this study (or, more accurately, reading the headlines and the media presentation of the study, because clearly they didn't read the study) told me I had to reconsider my view of this dangerous medicine. The study showed that Paxlovid reduced death by 80% and reduced hospitalization by 70%. You can't argue with those numbers! I mean, wow! But then I did something that my doctor colleagues hadn't done, that virtually no doctors do. I read the article and studied it.
I wrote about this on a blog in my personal site, but here's the short version:
The 80% reduction in death translates into a less impressive actual number: out of 1000 people who received Paxlovid compared to 1000 who didn't, 3 lives were saved. That's a benefit of 0.3%
The 70% reduction in hospitalization was even more puny. Out of 10,000 people who took Paxlovid, only 4 hospitalizations were averted. That's a benefit of 0.04%.
The study was retrospective; it looked at a group of people hospitalized for COVID and divided those who took Paxlovid from those who didn't. It didn't control for any variables regarding who took Paxlovid (were they younger, healthier, on other drugs that helped them, less likely to die of COVID) and didn't try to figure out if Pavlovid actually helped people or if the people who took Paxlovid were less at risk. This is crucial, since about 80% of retrospective studies are reversed and find just the opposite of their conclusions once more rigorous criteria are applied.
Most disturbing is that most people who don't take Paxlovid are more ill. That's because Paxlovid can't be given to people who are on certain drugs. Thus, in this study, the group of people who didn't take Paxlovid probably had far more chronic illness (heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, were older, ect) than those who took Paxlovid because the drugs they took for their medical conditions made them unable to take Paxlovid. Hence the 3/1000 people who lived longer likely didn't live longer because they took Paxlovid, but because they had less underlying illness.
Once these variables are taken into account, it is very likely that the numbers will reverse and that more people will have died who took Paxlovid than those who didn't.
At PPC we are going to wait for someone to conduct a robust prospective randomized trial before we pass out this snake oil to our patients. Why aren't they already conducting such a trial? That's easy! Why should Pfizer do any more research when its compliant medical peons are prescribing billions of dollars of Paxlovid already?
As Olser said, don't use medicines unless we're sure they have proven benefit and little risk. Paxlovid is just the opposite. We've treated hundreds of elders with COVID. The outcomes of our patients is substantially better than the national average, and essentially most of the patients we have lost either were end-stage even before COVID hit them, or they went to the hospital and received dangerous medicines like Paxlovid. Our patients do well because we care enough about them to make sure we're not hurting them with our cure.
Our goal at PPC is to be the filter between the declarations of misled "experts" (who often have a conflict of interest with Big Pharma or no academic discipline to actually read studies) and medical truth. Almost always, new poorly studied drugs should be avoided. Paxlovid is one such drug. It is potentially dangerous, interacts with many common medicines, and it's ineffective. We won't let our patients fall into the Paxlovid trap.</span></div></div>

Do you know any good books for learning VB .NET for someone like me? I don't want a book that just explains how to use the graphic environment and build GUIs. I have bought one those years ago and it wasn't helpful. It didn't explain much about the programming language ,but only how to create graphics.
I am asking this question here, because I already know java and want to go to VB .NET.

all of my friends came as couples. if i had a bunch of single girls &amp; he had guys there I could see splitting up for a girly slumber party. but, we would have just been alone &amp; I know I wouldn't have slept.
we parted ways after 11am when my hair dresser arrived &amp; saw each other at 2:30 for pre ceremony pictures.

We decided to avoid each other by saying that he would spend the day on one side of the resort &amp; I on the other. Initially we thought it wouldn't be that hard to avoid each other since the resort is so big. But we did kinda catch glances of each other throughout the morning. I would see him coming one way &amp; since I had the girls with me they would always run interference &amp; make him go another way, so it worked out in the end.
I was glad to be by myself the day of the wedding. I was able to relax &amp; think about everything leading up to that day. Although I didn't sleep that well &amp; kept wondering what he was doing that night &amp; what he was thinking, I'm glad that we chose not to see each other.

SS21: Tuedays 10–12.
Due to the CoVid-19 pandemic, we must arrange the seminar via video (zoom). The link has been sent to the participans via email.
The goal is to explore links between occupation times, Gaussian free fields, Poisson gases of Markovian loops, etc. For example, Ray-Knight type theorems and Dynkin isomorphism theorems relate local time of a Markov process to an associated Gaussian process. One can also consider Markovian loops, whose occupation times are related to the Gaussian free field via Le Jan's isomorphism theorem. Such identities have been applied in mathematical physics (quantum field theory) and were further developed, becoming an important part of modern probability theory, in the last 20 years or so.
Prerequisites: Basics of Stochastic processes and Markov chains suffices. Most topics concern continuous-time processes, but there is some literature on discrete-time analogs. For some topics, Stochastic Analysis (Brownian motion, martingales, stochastic calculus) is needed. The topics will be distributed according to people's background.

In a distributed system, exceptions that occur remotely must traverse process or computer boundaries before they reach the client. In a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), the boundary is a service boundary that may be located in the same process, or across process or computer boundaries. In this podcast, the speakers provide an introduction to SOAP faults and their relationship to service metadata, since they are the standard for propagating exceptions from services. The speakers also discuss different exception handling scenarios in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), including how services and clients handle Common Language Runtime (CLR) exceptions, how to declare and throw SOAP faults, and how to provide common exception-handling behaviors for a service using IErrorHandler.</span></div></div>

Is there a way to set the context from a script without loading a layout? I must be missing it if there is.
I had a script that wouldn't Find or Sort correctly (or at all) from a layout for one table, because part of the script operated on fields from a different table.
Freezing the screen and loading a layout from the table that the script operated on was the only way it would work.
Just seems like there would be a "Set ..." script step to do that.
Is there a sure-fire way to obtain context from a script?</span></div></div>

The basics for my new design are now available! The navigation bar now remains visible and no longer disappears when scrolling up. For the start page I have created my own template, which differs from the normal page setting. Also for the articles (blog, web development) I have created different templates (templates). There will be different navigation bars for specific areas, later once. To implement something like this, I use a so-called page builder. Specifically, the Elementor Pro Page Builder. The disadvantage of such tools is that they always need to be active and need some extra PHP memory for the plugin. If you can arrange with these things, you have a nice tool to build websites faster.
But beware. Such a tool is used to build up Internet presences faster, but in my opinion is not for laypeople (even if some advertisements promise this). The basis for Elementor is a suitable theme. For purists there is the “Hello Theme”, I use Astra Pro. So that after Theme Updates not everything I have changed is overwritten, I use a Child Theme from Astra. You can easily create it manually or have it created automatically in the online generator, on the Astra pages. Here, for example, I have defined in functions.php what should and should not be found in a search. In the basic setting, Astra had really shown me everything, such as templates, metas, etc. – But this has now been done with my new “SUCHE” widget.
To make all pages appear faster, I used a number of code optimization tools. However, it has been shown that this has repeatedly led to problems with the display of the websites. Now I only use a cache program that generates static pages from the dynamic pages. Especially with many new features on the web pages, however, the cache is deleted. Then, when a user calls the pages, it may take a little longer for the page to appear because it is being recreated. When the new homepage is ready, it will be very rare.
To make the web pages appear multilingual, I use the Polylang tool. This mainly organizes me the foreign language functions, such as searching or switching from one language to another. Here, careful attention must be paid to the compatibility of all components with each other. I have also invested a lot of time in terms of data protection and data security. The constantly changing legal situation is problematic. I am therefore considering making the homepage generally accessible via a homepage where the visitor must accept that his activities on the homepage may be used by me or third parties.
Now it’s painting! The header and footer specify the color space. All currently integrated background photos will be replaced by watercolors later. The topic of “clouds” must now be expanded. One idea is to paint flying objects. Almost between the clouds (head and footer) – Let’s see …</span></div></div>

(For me, this is intermittent.) When it happens, about 90% of the time it will cause PS itself to hang until a Force Quit.
If I close the FF dialog while it says "Save Image as..." instead of "Apply", and while the filter is still drawing, then PS always hangs.
This only happens when using the Filter Forge plug-in in PS, and only when the plug-in window is open at the time. (If I browse for new filters without the plug-in open, all is well.)
I have noticed that FF closing immediately after clicking the "Open in Filter Forge" button on the website is more likely to happen if the file I'm working on has not been saved (ever), if I have more than one file open at the time (especially if more than one has never been saved,) if I've downloaded several filters in one session, if I've opened one to see how it's made but not saved any changes, and if the filter I'm attempting to download is complex.
However, I can't make it happen consistently, in spite of trying to do so for the last two evenings. (I've downloaded a lot of filters, in that time! )
So I can't give you a reproducible, I'm sorry. But it's happening fairly often. When it does, about 15% of the time the new filter fails to be installed.
This is happening with both Firefox 3.0.7 and Safari 3.2.1. I'm on a 2 X 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon Mac, with 4 GB 800 MHz ram, running system 10.5.6.

Well, I am wrapping up my 3rd project at my company and this one taking sail today is of particular interest. I took on the design of the company web site.
Above is the new version while below is the old version. See, when I started here I was supposed to be working with a young guy responsible for the designs they were suing (seen below). I was not keen on the harsh gradients and the blotchy uses of purple. However, keeping the same story was still important.
In the above rendition of the project there are some nice dynamic element with RSS feeds into the site as well as a rotating visual menu shown in the bottom quarter. Although I designed the site, coworker William worked with me to make it fully functional.
The site works off of a Zend Framework. This is a small Zend project, but I will be posting another one soon that is an online app that I worked on as well. The original designer quit abruptly. My aesthetic obviously deviated from his, but at least management likes it.
Feel free to tell me what you think!</span></div></div>

You guys are right, venison jerky is scrumptious. I've not tried the jerky gun yet, although I have a friend who does it that way and it comes out real good. Does it make a mess of the oven racks, etc? Oh and, if you added your spices along with the Tender-quick, wouldn't that allow the meat to take it the flavor a little longer? I may answer my own question here before I'm done (LOL!), but I'm thinking that marinading may not be such an issue with the ground meat... Hmmmm

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The good news is that it's relatively inexpensive and simple to protect yourself from ESD damage. The key is making sure that all parts of your work bench (including yourself) are at the same electrical potential. You do this by working on a static dissipative mat (http://www.esdmat.com/), wearing an ESD wrist strap (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistatic_wrist_strap). Even though you're wearing a wrist strap it's important that you don't do anything to build up charge on your body. Shuffling your feet on the carpet or sitting on a synthetic fiber chair can both build significant static charge on your body.
My electronics work bench is right behind my computer and so it would be convenient to be able to swivel around from computer to work bench on my office chair. The problem for me is that my office chair is upholstered with polyester and builds static charge on my body very quickly. As a result I never use my office chair while working on the electronics bench and switching from computer to project is as a result a pain in the neck. Since I'm often programming an Arduino or other microprocessor I have to switch back and forth quite often.
The solution was to fit my chair with a static dissipative surface. My search for ESD safe chair covers brought up a number of very expensive professional options which were well outside of what I wanted to spend and so I turned my attention to making one from scratch.
I knew the surface needed to be electrically conductive and I first looked into conductive fabrics like this stuff: http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9769. The problem with that stuff is, once again, the price tag. I knew I could do better price-wise. The solution turned out to be space blanket. This stuff is polyester sheet with aluminum vapor deposited on it in a super thin layer. The aluminum layer is conductive and the stuff is super cheap; it was the perfect solution.
Step 1: Ingredients
1) Space Blanket. You can get this from camping stores or good hardware stores. You can also pick it up cheap online like from Amazon. Expect to pay around $3 (US) for one.
2) 18-gauge stranded copper wire, preferably with green insulation (green is always ground in the US). 6 or 8 feet will be fine.
3) One 500 kilo-ohm resistor. You could just as easily use a 1 mega-ohm or 2 mega-ohm resistor. The purpose of the resistor is to make sure that current doesn't flow from some other part of the project into your seat cover. That wouldn't be nice at all.
4) Heat shrink tubing
5) Two alligator clips.
6) Packing tape (optional)</span></div></div>

- Awn - Not much happening at the moment from my side. Hopefully this will change in a couple of weeks, at which point I hope to finish the remainder of non-composite support in trunk, and make a beta release for 0.4
- Random Hacking - Since late last year, most of my spare hacking time has been spent on Awn, which is great, but it means some of my other ideas/projects got left behind. So, I've been trying to remedy this by picking up these projects and starting to work on them once again. The two I'm concentrating on at the moment are Nautilus and Affinity. I hope to get some code out soon, so stay tuned!

Apparently, it’s well put together, but hard to learn. I haven’t tried the Frogpad yet, but have tried several ergonomic keyboards in my quest to help my RSI hands and they do seem to have steep learning curves in common.
The problem is we all learned to type with QWERTY keyboards, a setup that was originally invented to force people to type slower in order to keep the mechanical keys from jamming. Unfortunately, there’s nothing ergonomic about the QWERTY layout, and there’s no need to stick to it when using a computer. If you’re thinking about changing to something else (lots of today’s ergonomic keyboards are coming out with alternatives that put the more used keys under the stronger digits, ie. Enter under the thumb instead of the pinkie), you should be prepared for the fact that it will come with a steep learning curve. If you can, try to rent or borrow an ergonomic keyboard before committing to buying it.
If you don’t want to learn something new but one something that’s easier on the hands, I recommend the Kinesis Contoured Keyboard, which I’ve had good luck with. Though some keys are hard to get used to (ie. arrows being split and moved), the most used keys are in the same place, just canted a little differently.
Read the Frogpad review at FrogPad takes time — a lot of time — to master</span></div></div>

Last week I played a bit with crosvm, a KVM monitor used within Chromium OS for application isolation. My goal is to learn more about the current limits of virtualization for isolating applications in mainline. Two of crosvm's defining characteristics is that it's written in Rust for increased security, and that uses namespaces extensively to reduce the attack surface of the monitor itself.
It was quite easy to get it running outside Chromium OS (have been testing with Fedora 26), with the only complication being that minijail isn't widely packaged in distros. In the instructions below we hack around the issue with linker environment variables so we don't have to install it properly. Instructions are in form of shell commands for illustrative purposes only.

<p>This code-related data from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1">Fineweb</a> was specifically used in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04905">OpenCoder</a> pre-training. 
We employ fastText in three iterative rounds to recall a final dataset of 55B code and math-related data. 
You can find math-related data at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenCoder-LLM/fineweb-math-corpus">OpenCoder-LLM/fineweb-math-corpus</a>.</p>
