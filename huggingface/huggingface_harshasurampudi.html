World Wide does not dispute that the Kazakhstan State Committee is an “agency or instrumentality of a foreign state” within the meaning s not define an implied waiver.” Creighton Ltd. v. Government of the State of Qatar, 181 F.3d 118, 122 (D.C.Cir.1999). This circuit, however, has \&quot;followed ctant to stray beyond these examples when considering claims that a nation has implicitly waived its defense of sovereign immunity.\&quot; Princz v. Federal Republic of Germany, 26 F.3d 1166, 1174 (D.C.Cir.1994) (quoting Frolova, 761 F.2d at 377). 12 . Cf. C &amp; L Enters., Inc. v.

The Management Agreement states: \&quot;In&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is the Kazakhstan State Committee considered an \&quot;agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\&quot; within the meaning defined by Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question at hand revolves around whether the Kazakhstan State Committee qualifies as an \&quot;agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\&quot; as per the definition provided in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't. In this case, the Supreme Court defined such entities as those that are an integral part of a foreign government, performing governmental functions on its behalf. While World Wide does not contest the classification of the Kazakhstan State Committee as an \&quot;agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\&quot; it is essential to establish its official status. The Creighton Ltd. v. Government of the State of Qatar case further clarifies that an implied waiver of sovereign immunity does not occur simply based on the relationship between an entity and a foreign state. Therefore, to determine if the Kazakhstan State Committee falls under this category, it is crucial to ascertain its role and function within the government. Previous precedent in the Princz v. Federal Republic of Germany case suggests that it is inappropriate to stray beyond the explicit examples provided when considering claims of implied waiver of sovereign immunity. Thus, a thorough analysis of the Kazakhstan State Committee's nature, function, and relationship with the government is necessary to determine its classification.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The categorization of the Kazakhstan State Committee as an \&quot;agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\&quot; within the definition provided in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83 has not been explicitly addressed in the given legal context. Further investigation and analysis of the committee's role, function, and relationship with the government are required to determine its classification accurately.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;in the record when there is no indication in the record that the act upon which error is predicated ever occurred (ie., the state’s use of its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks). In both Jackson and [Ex parte] Godboltl, 546 So.2d 991 (Ala.1987),] the records were sufficient to show that prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination could be made by the defendants; therefore, those cases were remanded for determinations on the issue under the guidelines set out in Bat-son.” 509 So.2d at 1076-77 (second emphasis added). Thus, the Watkins Court established that when nothing in the record supports the bare allegation that a constitutional violation occurred, a court cannot find plain error. See also White v. State, 587 So.2d 1218 (Ala.Crim.App.1990), affd, 587 So.2d 1236 (Ala.1991) (<HOLDING>). Cf. Brooks v.

The Watkins Court established that if the record does not support the allegation of a constitutional violation, the court cannot find plain error. In cases like Jackson and Godboltl, where there was evidence to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, the court remanded the cases for further determination under the guidelines set out in Bat-son. However, in situations where there is no indication in the record to support the claim of a constitutional violation, the court cannot find plain error. This principle was reiterated in the White v. State case. Therefore, in a case where there is no evidence of a constitutional violation, the court cannot find plain error.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, a court cannot find plain error in a case when there is no indication in the record that a constitutional violation occurred, as established in the Watkins Court and supported by the White v.

See id. Moreover, in light of Kane, the Bankruptcy Court was incorrect that an “intentional tort” is required for nondis-chargeability under § 523(a)(6), See id. Rather, all that is required is that Monson’s behavior was \&quot;willful” and \&quot;malicious,” which the Bankruptcy Court found. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court actually imposed a higher standard than what our case law requires, and it still determined that his actions met that standard. 10 . Monson’s reí janee on our decision in In re Wolfson, 56 F.3d 52 (11th Cir. 1995) (<HOLDING>), is misplaced. In Wolfson, two brothers ran a&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Can Monson be held liable for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(6) even if his behavior does not qualify as an intentional tort?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question revolves around the requirement for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(6). In Kane, it was established that even under a more stringent subjective standard, if the evidence supports that the debtor intentionally committed an act that they knew would cause harm, it qualifies for nondischargeability. The court further clarified that an \&quot;intentional tort\&quot; is not necessary for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(6), but rather, the behavior must be willful and malicious. The Bankruptcy Court in this case found that Monson's behavior met this standard. Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court actually imposed a higher standard than what is required by our case law. Monson's reliance on the In re Wolfson case is misplaced, as it is not directly applicable to the present situation.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, Monson can be held liable for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(6) even if his behavior does not qualify as an intentional tort, as established in Kane and clarified by the Bankruptcy Court's decision in this case. Monson's behavior was found to be willful and malicious, satisfying the requirements for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(6).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;acquired through the knowing use of perjured testimony by the prosecution violates due process.

Second, the use of the location must be notorious, meaning that it is well-known or easily recognizable. There are various cases such as In re John Adams Henry, Inc. and In re Golden Kernel, Inc. that support this requirement. However, it should be noted that mere bookkeeping activities, as mentioned in In re McQuaide case, would not satisfy the criterion of \&quot;doing business.\&quot; Therefore, if a debtor frequently uses a specific location for revenue generation and this use is notorious, they can be considered as \&quot;doing business\&quot; at that location.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, if a debtor frequently uses a specific location for revenue generation and this use is well-known or easily recognizable, they can be considered as \&quot;doing business\&quot; at that location, as established by the Mimshell Fabrics, LTD. case and supported by other relevant cases.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;a stay of imposition, as part of the plea agreement, but objected to providing for a later vacation of the plea and dismissal of the charge.

The prosecutor in this case objected to such a provision, citing Minn.Stat. § 609.2242, subd. 2 (1998), which states that if the plea is later vacated and the charge dismissed, it cannot be used to enhance a later offense. However, the district court in this case declined to sentence the defendant and indicated that the defendant appeared to be a good candidate for probation, had no prior offenses, and that many prosecutors in the county did not object to this type of disposition. It is important to note that the court did not provide a written order explaining its reasons for declining to sentence the defendant. Based on the available authority, including State v.

The court in Penturelli also supported this view, stating that the splitting up of mineral interests falls under the definition of securities. Furthermore, Gilbert v. Nixon and Shimer v.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that such deprivations without adequate notice or opportunity to respond may implicate a liberty interest protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.

These cases define \&quot;public place\&quot; as a location where a person's behavior can be observed by others, regardless of whether it is a completely public or private space. Additionally, a case from Illinois, People v.

In this case, the trial court imposed a reimbursement order without conducting a hearing, which goes against the principles set forth in the Roberson case.

The Court is also persuaded that Petitioners are not irreparably harmed by this Court’s abstention while military commissions proceed with the charges against Petitioners. The inconvenience of any criminal prosecution, including those associated with the military commissions, is insufficient, standing alone, to warrant federal court intervention. Cf. Younger v.

It is significant that the language of section 300aa-32 conferring jurisdiction on federal appellate courts is permissive in nature—parties may file a petition for review of regulations promulgated under the Vaccine Act in the courts of appeals within 60 days of their enactment. The statutory language does not explicitly require a party to challenge reg ulations under the Vaccine Act within such time period and in such a forum. Therefore, we cannot say that Congress clearly intended to limit judicial review to the 60-day period. The language in section 300aa-32 thus differs from the mandatory language found in some other statutory review clauses. See Eagle-Picher Industries v. EPA, 759 F.2d 905, 911 (D.C.Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>).

The statutory language of section 300aa-32, which confers jurisdiction on federal appellate courts, is permissive in nature. It states that parties may file a petition for review within 60 days of the regulations' enactment. This language does not explicitly mandate a party to challenge the regulations within the specified time period and forum. As a result, it cannot be concluded that Congress clearly intended to limit judicial review to the 60-day period. This contrasts with other statutory review clauses that contain mandatory language. For instance, the case of Eagle-Picher Industries v. EPA held that a similar mandatory language existed in a different statute. While the language in section 300aa-32 is permissive, it does not impose a strict requirement for parties to challenge regulations within the 60-day timeframe and in the courts of appeals.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, it is not mandatory for parties to challenge regulations under the Vaccine Act within 60 days in the courts of appeals, as the statutory language does not explicitly require such a timeframe or forum for judicial review.

Allowing equitable subrogation suits would severely undercut thé Arkansas legislature’s determination of when an attorney should face potential liability for professional negligence. Additionally, allowing equitable subrogation claims in this context would, in essence, be founded on an assignment of the insured’s tort claim against its attorneys to the insurer which paid a portion of the insured’s claim. Arguably, Arkansas law does not permit the assignment of tort claims. See Midwest Mutual Insurance Co. v. Arkansas National Co., 260 Ark. 352, 538 S.W.2d 574 (1976)(<HOLDING>).

Allowing equitable subrogation suits in this context would contradict the legislature's determination of when an attorney should be held liable for professional negligence. Furthermore, the court in Midwest Mutual Insurance Co. v.

The court emphasized that even though absolute immunity protects both the unworthy and the worthy, it serves the broader public interest by preventing a potential chilling effect on the exercise of professional judgment and discretion by child services workers. This is essential for the protection of abused children in their role as an arm of the Probate Court.

These activities include interference with federal inspection of mining claims adjacent to a national forest and the presence of campers on a river bed adjacent to a national forest. The court's reasoning is based on the objective of section 551, which is to regulate the occupancy and use of national forests and to preserve them. Therefore, section 551 confers federal jurisdiction in situations where activities impact national forests, thereby allowing for the enforcement of rules and regulations governing such forests.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, section 551 confers federal jurisdiction over activities that affect the national forests, as established in cases like United States v.

Both counts seek awards of money damages due to the alleged nonpayment, including amounts for unpaid principal, interest, and late fees. Thus, both counts are seeking legal (as opposed to equitable) relief. See, e.g., Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U.S. 363, 370, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974) (<HOLDING>); Cerrito v.

However, the result differs for the other two counts of the Bank's complaint, namely claims under the note and guaranty, which assert breach of contract. These counts allege that Swan Landing and Yazdani failed to fulfill their contractual obligations by not making the required payments.

In the case of Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., the Supreme Court upheld a verdict in favor of a distributor, who was characterized as a \&quot;discount operation,\&quot; against a manufacturer that conspired with other distributors to maintain resale prices and eliminate price-cutters. This precedent demonstrates that distributors are allowed to bring antitrust suits against manufacturers engaged in price-fixing. Furthermore, the Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. case establishes that a plaintiff falls within the protected zone of interests of antitrust laws when they can demonstrate competitive injury and that their injuries were reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, distributors, as participants in the market affected by price-fixing, are within the zone of protection. In light of this legal reasoning, it can be concluded that a distributor can indeed bring an antitrust suit against a manufacturer engaged in price-fixing.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, a distributor can bring an antitrust suit against a manufacturer engaged in price-fixing, as established by the Supreme Court's ruling in Monsanto Co. v.

The court in Eiss noted that “[t]he law is not concerned with the existence of negligence in the abstract; the law is only concerned with negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury complained of by the plaintiff.” Eiss, 233 Va. at 553, 357 S.E.2d at 543. Similarly, in jurisdictions that look to comparative fault rather than contributory negligence, many have held that a patient’s conduct prior to treatment should not be considered for comparative fault purposes. See, e.g., Mercer v. Vanderbilt Univ., Inc., 134 S.W.3d 121, 125 (Tenn.2003) (<HOLDING>); Whitehead v.

In the case of Eiss v. Lillis, it was established that a patient's contributory negligence cannot be used as a defense if the patient's conduct occurred before the doctor's treatment. The court's reasoning was that negligence should only be considered if it was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. Similarly, in jurisdictions that follow comparative fault, a patient's conduct prior to treatment is generally not considered for comparative fault purposes. This means that even if the patient's conduct was negligent, it cannot be used as a defense in a medical malpractice case.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, a patient's conduct prior to treatment cannot be used as a defense in a medical malpractice case, as established in the Eiss v.

The district judge arrived at the entirely reasonable conclusion that Detective Cudo gave Mr. Gaines Miranda warnings not once, but twice. The district judge found Mr. Gaines’ statement that he did not receive Miranda warnings “not credible.” Her conclusion is well supported, and this court has no reason to disturb her findings of fact on this issue. Mr. Gaines also argues that his confession was not voluntary. He contends that the Miranda warnings were deficient because Detective Cudo failed to advise him that he had the right to have counsel appointed prior to questioning or that he could terminate the questioning at any time. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 103, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975) (<HOLDING>).

In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that before custodial interrogation, the suspect must be informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney present, and that anything they say can be used against them in a court of law. Here, the district judge found Mr. Gaines' claim that he did not receive Miranda warnings to be not credible. The judge determined that Detective Cudo gave Mr. Gaines Miranda warnings not once, but twice. Considering the judge's credibility determination and the district judge's findings of fact, there is no reason to overturn this conclusion. Mr. Gaines argues that his confession was not voluntary due to deficient Miranda warnings, but Detective Cudo's testimony supports that he provided the required warnings. Therefore, it can be concluded that Detective Cudo adequately gave Mr. Gaines his Miranda warnings before questioning.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, Detective Cudo adequately gave Mr. Gaines his Miranda warnings before questioning him, as determined by the district judge's credibility findings and the testimony of Detective Cudo.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:54,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;P.3d 753, 758-59 (App.2014) (rejecting public policy argument that would impose duty on event organizers for portions of event outside their control).

This policy is based on the principle that the trustee has the power and duty to prosecute actions for the benefit of all creditors and shareholders in the estate if the cause of action belongs to the estate.

Morfin clearly benefited as a result of his broken promise. Also, although strictly speaking Martinez himself was not placed in a worse position as a result of his action in reliance on Morfin's promise, his heirs and intended beneficiaries of the life insurance policies and pension, Connie and Jessica, were.

Martinez then named Morfin as the beneficiary based on this promise. However, Morfin broke his promise, and Connie and Jessica were placed in a worse position as a result. While Martinez himself may not have been placed in a worse position, the fact that his intended beneficiaries suffered is sufficient to support a finding of constructive fraud. This reasoning is supported by the case of Melloh, where a similar situation led to a finding of constructive fraud.

Thus, while Prostok’s action contemplates relief other than revoking the confirmation order, it necessarily challenges the integrity of the order and results in a review, perhaps a recalculation, of the bankruptcy determinations of the assets to which some claimants are entitled.

Additionally, the court would need to determine the percentage of the estate that each class of creditors would have been entitled to if the bankruptcy court had taken the larger estate into consideration.

Ferguson’s police report, however, indicated that Throneberry turned the lights off about 100 yards down the street after he exited the alley. Ferguson further testified that, when he observed Throneberry’s car fishtail out of the alley, he activated his emergency lights and siren in an attempt to stop Throneberry’s vehicle.

A. The Intentional Tort Claims The district court dismissed plaintiffs § 1983 claims pursuant to the common law non-survival rule because it found those claims most analogous to intentional tort causes of action. We agree with that conclusion. Plaintiffs § 1983 claims are premised on defendants’ excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure of Blouin in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has held that such claims are necessarily predicated on intentional conduct. Brower v.

The district court ruled that the plaintiffs' § 1983 claims are most analogous to intentional tort causes of action and dismissed them under the common law non-survival rule. This ruling is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in Brower v. County of Inyo, which held that claims for excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure under § 1983 are necessarily predicated on intentional conduct. Therefore, it is clear that the intentional tort causes of action are appropriate for the plaintiffs' § 1983 claims.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, the plaintiffs can pursue their § 1983 claims for excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure under the intentional tort causes of action, as determined by the district court and supported by the Supreme Court's decision in Brower v.

The applicability of the relevant hearsay exception is a mere procedural change that “does ‘not increase the punishment nor change the ingredients of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt’.” Pilcher v.

However, the court points out that the application of the relevant hearsay exception is merely a procedural change that does not increase the punishment or alter the elements of the offense required for establishing guilt.

Moreover, contrary to UMMC’s urging, plaintiffs have alleged and offered proof that they suffered an adverse employment action, namely, a denial of the opportunity for overtime and accompanying compensation.

Additionally, the plaintiffs have alleged and presented evidence that they faced an adverse employment action - denial of the opportunity for overtime and accompanying compensation. This aligns with precedent set in Johnson v. Manpower Prof'l Servs., Inc., where it was held that a denial of overtime constitutes an adverse employment action. Based on these factors, if plaintiffs can provide proof that UMMC's stated legitimate reason for the denial of overtime is merely a pretext for gender discrimination, UMMC may not be granted summary judgment on the claim of gender discrimination.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, UMMC cannot be granted summary judgment on the claim of gender discrimination in this case, as plaintiffs have provided evidence suggesting that UMMC's articulated legitimate reason for the denial of overtime may be pretext for gender discrimination, as per the Johnson v.

Gutierrez moved the BIA to reopen on the grounds that she suffered a violation of due process as a result of the ineffective assistance of an unaccredited representative, but her new counsel, Ricci and Sprouls, failed to petition this Court for review of the BIA’s denial of this motion.

In Russo v.

Similarly, in Donatelli v. National Hockey League, the court ruled that activities such as televising games, selling merchandise, and sending scouts and referees for exhibition games in a state were not enough to establish general jurisdiction over an unincorporated association. However, in Kim v. Keenan, the court held a different position. It is important to consider the specific details of the Kim v.

While Russo v. Sea World of Florida, Inc. and Donatelli v. National Hockey League establish that such activities are not sufficient grounds for personal jurisdiction, Kim v.

However, it is important to note that Moore's attempt to distinguish Farnsworth based on the specific labeling of the offense was rejected. The court explicitly stated that it did not reach the argument regarding whether all vehicular manslaughter should automatically be considered a crime of violence.

In prior cases like Rudin v. Lincoln Land Community College and Giacoletto v.

Additionally, AS 47.10.086(a) states that the Office of Children's Services is responsible for investigating reports of child abuse and neglect. As per Alaska law, Casey's misstatements in self-reporting can be interpreted as a form of child abuse or neglect, as it can lead to incorrect assessments of the child's welfare. The case law in Alaska supports this interpretation. In Audrey H. v.

Similarly, in Sherman B. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc.

Barstow have held that the implied duty to diligently explore, operate, and market the oil product is a continuing one, but they do not specifically address its application in the primary term. On the other hand, Young v. Dixie Oil Co. held that the payment of shut-in royalties extends the lease into the secondary term, indicating that the covenant may not operate in the primary term. Furthermore, Reid v. Gulf Oil Corp. affirmed that the primary term does not trigger the implied covenant to market. Therefore, based on the absence of clear precedent supporting the covenant's operation during the primary term, it is unlikely that it applies during that period.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The implied covenant to market does not operate in the primary term of the lease, as supported by the lack of clear precedent addressing its application during this period.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;not clear as to the recipients of this communication.

However, the parties involved seemingly assume that the email was sent to essentially the same people as Slue's email and Freedberg's previous emails. As per the Kirwin v. N.Y. State Office of Mental Health case, it is necessary to establish a strict standard for claims of severe emotional distress caused by the failure to receive benefits.

It follows that when, as here, an FBI employee, consistent with the FBI’s Policy on Harassment, reports an incident of sexual harassment, the employee is acting within the scope of her employment. In sum, the facts and circumstances of this case point convincingly to the conclusion that Schoeneman was acting within the scope of her FBI employment when she complained to FBI officials about alleged workplace sexual harassment. Also pertinent to the scope of employment calculus is that the allegedly false reports of harassment were made at the FBI’s facilities while Schoeneman was on duty. See Gulf Underwriters Ins. Co. v.

According to the Supreme Court of Virginia in Davis v. Merrill, an employee is acting within the scope of their employment when they engage in activities that are consistent with the employer's policies. In this case, the FBI's Policy on Harassment supports an employee reporting incidents of sexual harassment. Furthermore, the fact that the allegedly false reports were made at the FBI's facilities while the employee was on duty, as highlighted in Gulf Underwriters Ins. Co. v. KSI Services, Inc., suggests that the act of reporting falls within the scope of employment. Therefore, based on these legal principles and precedents, it can be concluded that an FBI employee reporting an incident of workplace sexual harassment would indeed be considered within the scope of their employment.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, reporting an incident of workplace sexual harassment by an FBI employee would be considered within the scope of their employment, as established by the Supreme Court of Virginia in Davis v.

Pursuant to this statute, the United States asserted jurisdiction over the vessel under the authority of a statement of no objection (SN 43 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 969, 108 S.Ct. 465, 98 L.Ed.2d 404 (1987) (<HOLDING>).

According to statute § 1903, a vessel registered in a foreign nation can be subject to United States law if the flag nation has consented or waived objection to its enforcement. The consent or waiver of objection can be obtained through oral or electronic means and can be proven by certification from the Secretary of State or their designee. In the case of SN 43 (11th Cir.), the United States asserted jurisdiction over the vessel based on a statement of no objection.

Given the uncertainty over when the tran scripts would finally be ready (and, more generally, over Peoples’ need for additional time to prepare for trial), the district court lacked sufficient information on November 8 to set a specific trial date. Thus, it was perfectly reasonable for the district court to grant an open-ended continuance that extended until the first available trial date after the transcripts were ready. In addition, the continuance only lasted about five months, and the trial itself occurred just two-and-a-half months after the court reporter completed and filed the transcripts the defendants had requested. Such a relatively short period of time is not unreasonable. See, e.g., Twitty, 107 F.3d at 1489 (<HOLDING>); Lattany, 982 F.2d at 874-76 (ruling that&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it reasonable for the district court to grant an open-ended continuance until the transcripts are ready for a trial?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question pertains to the reasonableness of granting an open-ended continuance until the transcripts are ready for a trial.

The duration of the continuance, which lasted around five months, followed by a trial in just two-and-a-half months after the filing of the transcripts, can be considered relatively short and within the bounds of reasonableness. This reasoning aligns with the decisions in cases such as Twitty and Lattany, where similar situations were deemed reasonable.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, it is considered reasonable for the district court to grant an open-ended continuance until the transcripts are ready for a trial, especially when there is uncertainty regarding the availability of the transcripts and the defendant's need for additional time to prepare.

If it had, we note that Blakely was decided&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the relation between the charges of kidnapping and manslaughter in the context of Alexandre's case and how does it affect the burden of proof for proving prejudice?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In Alexandre's case, the court found that the charges of kidnapping and manslaughter were \&quot;intertwined\&quot; and seen as \&quot;one course of conduct\&quot;. Based on competent evidence in the record, the court determined that Alexandre had not met his burden of proving prejudice with respect to the manslaughter sentence. This means that Alexandre failed to show that he suffered any harm or disadvantage specifically related to the sentence for manslaughter. The court's decision is supported by the evidence in the record and is not clearly erroneous.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The charges of kidnapping and manslaughter in Alexandre's case are considered intertwined and seen as one course of conduct. Alexandre failed to meet his burden of proving prejudice with respect to the sentence for manslaughter, meaning that he did not show any specific harm or disadvantage related to that sentence.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gives his written promise to appear at the time and place stated, the officer may release him from custody or take him immediately before a magistrate, but shall not require the person arrested to deposit his operator's license. Any such person refusing to give the written promise to appear shall be taken immediately by the arresting officer before the nearest or most accessible magistrate having jurisdiction. Any person who willfully violates his written promise to appear shall be punished as provided in R.S. 32:57.1, regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was arrested originally. The arresting officer shall fully inform the arrested person of the consequences of failing to honor a written promise to appear pursuant to R.S. 32:57.1.” 4 . Marcantel ver (3d Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). 7 . Plaintiffs' § 1983 \&quot;excessive force claim&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are the consequences for a person who willfully violates their written promise to appear after being arrested?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question pertains to the consequences of violating a written promise to appear after being arrested. According to the given context, when a person is arrested and provides a written promise to appear, they may be released from custody by the officer or taken before a magistrate. However, if the person refuses to give their written promise, they must be taken immediately before the nearest or most accessible magistrate with jurisdiction. The context further states that anyone who willfully violates their written promise to appear will be punished as provided in R.S. 32:57.1, regardless of the disposition of the original charge. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are specific consequences for individuals who fail to honor their written promise to appear after being arrested.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A person who willfully violates their written promise to appear after being arrested will be subject to punishment as outlined in R.S. 32:57.1, regardless of the outcome of the original charge.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:88,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;and reinvest the proceeds. “Courts may not permit the positing of transactions which are unlikely and plainly contrary to the economic interest of a hypothetical buyer.” Estate of Smith v. Comm’r, 198 F.3d 515, 529 (5th Cir.1999), citing Eisenberg, 155 F.3d at 57. The Tax Court’s internally inconsistent assumptions, that a hypothetical purchaser of Johnco stock would engage in long-range timber production even though the Timber Property’s annual rate of return is substantially lower than the investor’s required return, fatally flawed its decision to discount s, proximity, and time, the more probative it is of value. Id. Courts have observed, however, that agreed valuations near in time to a decedent’s death are not conclusive. United States v. Simmons, 346 F.2d 213, 216 (5th Cir.1965) (<HOLDING>); First Nat’l Bank of Kenosha v. United States,&quot;},&quot;Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Can the Tax Court's decision to discount the value of Johnco stock be considered flawed if it assumes the hypothetical buyer would engage in long-range timber production even though the Timber Property's annual rate of return is substantially lower than the investor's required return?&quot;},&quot;Legal Reasoning&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question involves the validity of the Tax Court's decision to discount the value of Johnco stock based on the assumption that a hypothetical buyer would engage in long-range timber production. According to Estate of Smith v. Comm'r, courts are not permitted to propose transactions that are unlikely and contrary to the economic interest of a hypothetical buyer. In this case, the Timber Property's annual rate of return is substantially lower than the investor's required return, which suggests that a hypothetical buyer would not engage in such a transaction. This inconsistency in the Tax Court's assumptions critically undermines its decision to discount the value of the stock. The more probative a valuation is of value, the greater importance it holds in assessing the value of an asset. While valuations near the decedent's death are not conclusive, it is essential to consider the economic viability of the assumptions made by the court.&quot;},&quot;Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, the Tax Court's decision to discount the value of Johnco stock can be considered flawed as it assumes that a hypothetical buyer would engage in long-range timber production, even though the Timber Property's annual rate of return is substantially lower than the investor's required return. This assumption goes against the principle that courts should not propose transactions that are unlikely and contrary to the economic interest of a hypothetical buyer, as established in Estate of Smith v. Comm'r. Additionally, the inconsistency in the assumptions made by the Tax Court undermines the validity of its decision.&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:14991,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzE1MSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL2hhcnNoYXN1cmFtcHVkaS9sZWdhbC1yZWFzb25pbmctbGZxYS1zeW50aGV0aWMiLCJleHAiOjE3NDI5MjY3NTEsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHVnZ2luZ2ZhY2UuY28ifQ.8_zODJ3qPh8P78cO3F4Uiq_SU7fb46G2JXzZ5aGJp3gN_eSqop7dXwCq6T7tKv_fkbApvc1ns1etHP3kkH3mCw&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;harshasurampudi/legal-reasoning-lfqa-synthetic&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;63aa9b64b7f3e1c60727d7f1&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/6dd83b3c0b289aaebe6f888b7bca123c.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Sai Sri Harsha Surampudi&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;harshasurampudi&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The question at hand revolves around whether the Kazakhstan State Committee qualifies as an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state" as per the definition provided in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't. In this case, the Supreme Court defined such entities as those that are an integral part of a foreign government, performing governmental functions on its behalf. While World Wide does not contest the classification of the Kazakhstan State Committee as an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state," it is essential to establish its official status. The Creighton Ltd. v. Government of the State of Qatar case further clarifies that an implied waiver of sovereign immunity does not occur simply based on the relationship between an entity and a foreign state. Therefore, to determine if the Kazakhstan State Committee falls under this category, it is crucial to ascertain its role and function within the government. Previous precedent in the Princz v. Federal Republic of Germany case suggests that it is inappropriate to stray beyond the explicit examples provided when considering claims of implied waiver of sovereign immunity. Thus, a thorough analysis of the Kazakhstan State Committee's nature, function, and relationship with the government is necessary to determine its classification.</span></div></div>

In Ex parte Wilson, the Texas Criminal Appeals Court applied the two-part test established in Strickland v. Washington to determine if defense counsel's actions amounted to professional negligence. According to the court, the failure of defense counsel to inform a defendant of a plea offer falls below an objective standard of professional reasonableness. This omission is considered a "gross deviation from accepted professional standards." The United States v. Blaylock case further supports this reasoning, stating that the failure to communicate a plea bargain offer is unreasonable performance according to prevailing professional standards. Similarly, the court in Johnson v. Duckworth held that defense counsel's failure to inform the defendant about a plea offer constituted professional negligence. Therefore, in this case, the failure of defense counsel to inform the defendant of the plea offers made by the State can be considered professional negligence.</span></div></div>

Courts have long permitted distributors to bring antitrust suits against manufacturers engaged in price-fixing. For example, in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., the Supreme Court affirmed a verdict for a distributor, “a discount operation,” against a manufacturer who conspired with other distributors to “maintain resale prices and terminate price cutters.” 465 U.S. 752, 756, 765, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984).

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The question concerns the permissibility of a distributor filing an antitrust suit against a price-fixing manufacturer. In the case of Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., the Supreme Court upheld a verdict in favor of a distributor, who was characterized as a "discount operation," against a manufacturer that conspired with other distributors to maintain resale prices and eliminate price-cutters. This precedent demonstrates that distributors are allowed to bring antitrust suits against manufacturers engaged in price-fixing. Furthermore, the Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. case establishes that a plaintiff falls within the protected zone of interests of antitrust laws when they can demonstrate competitive injury and that their injuries were reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, distributors, as participants in the market affected by price-fixing, are within the zone of protection. In light of this legal reasoning, it can be concluded that a distributor can indeed bring an antitrust suit against a manufacturer engaged in price-fixing.</span></div></div>

The court of appeals in the case of State v. Pittman established that an overt, threatening act or a physical encounter can be sufficient legal provocation. Given that the unprovoked shooting by Salter can be deemed an overt and threatening act, it provides evidence for a jury to infer legal provocation. Additionally, Niles' testimony stating that he immediately returned fire out of fear for himself and his fiancee further contributes to the argument that Niles was acting under an uncontrollable impulse to do violence. This reasoning aligns with the decision in State v. Wiggins. Therefore, considering both the evidence of Salter's shooting and Niles' testimony, it can be asserted that the shooting can be seen as legal provocation.</span></div></div>

In the case of SN 43 (11th Cir.), the United States asserted jurisdiction over the vessel based on a statement of no objection. This means that if the flag nation has given its consent or waived objection, the United States can indeed assert jurisdiction over the foreign vessel.</span></div></div>
