So, Paul made some money mowing lawns and some money weed eating. He made $44 from mowing lawns, and we don't know how much he made from weed eating. But we do know that if he spends $9 a week, his money will last him 8 weeks. So, I need to figure out how much he made from weed eating.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how much money Paul has in total. If he spends $9 each week and this lasts him 8 weeks, then the total amount of money he has must be enough to cover 8 weeks of spending. So, I can calculate that by multiplying $9 by 8. Let me do that: 9 times 8 is 72. So, Paul has $72 in total.\n\nNow, out of this $72, we know that $44 came from mowing lawns. So, the rest must have come from weed eating. To find out how much he made from weed eating, I can subtract the $44 he made from mowing lawns from the total $72. So, 72 minus 44 equals... let me calculate that. 72 minus 40 is 32, and then minus 4 more is 28. So, Paul made $28 from weed eating.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If he made $44 from mowing and $28 from weed eating, that adds up to $72. And if he spends $9 a week, then 72 divided by 9 is 8 weeks. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think $28 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nPaul made $28 from weed eating.&quot;},&quot;problem&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Paul made forty-four dollars mowing lawns and some money weed eating.

We also know that he made $44 from mowing lawns. To find out how much he made from weed eating, we subtract the money he made from mowing lawns from the total amount of money he had:\n\nMoney made weed eating = Total money - Money made mowing lawns\nMoney made weed eating = $72 - $44\nMoney made weed eating = $28\n\nTherefore, Paul made $\\boxed{\\$28}$  from weed eating.&quot;},&quot;verified&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;quality_metrics&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;id_71&quot;},&quot;reannotated_assistant_content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;<think>\nFirst, I need to understand the notation provided.

If Carl earns $0.75 each week, over four weeks that's:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 4 = 3.00\n\\]\nYes, that's correct. And each candy bar costs $0.50, so dividing $3.00 by $0.50 gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{3.00}{0.50} = 6\n\\]\nThat still adds up.

Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, it looks like the total number of sides is 48.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of sides when Tom and Tim each bring 4 six-sided dice to school, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of dice:**\n   - Tom brings 4 dice.\n   - Tim brings 4 dice.\n   - Total dice = 4 (Tom) + 4 (Tim) = **8 dice**.\n\n2. **Determine the number of sides per die:**\n   - Each die has 6 sides.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of sides:**\n   - Total sides = Total dice × Sides per die\n   - Total sides = 8 × 6 = **48 sides**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThere are **48** total sides.&quot;},&quot;problem&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Tom and Tim both brought 4, six-sided dice to school.

First, I need to determine the total number of children on the playground by adding the number of boys and girls.

There are 27 boys and 35 girls.

Adding these together: 27 boys + 35 girls = 62 children.

Therefore, the total number of children on the playground is 62.
&lt;/think>

To find the total number of children on the playground, we simply add the number of boys and girls together.

\[
\text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls}
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
\text{Total children} = 27 \text{ boys} + 35 \text{ girls} = 62 \text{ children}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{62}
\]</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the cost per dozen oranges. John bought three dozen oranges for \$28.80, so I can find the cost per dozen by dividing the total cost by the number of dozens.

Next, with the cost per dozen known, I can calculate the cost for five dozen oranges by multiplying the cost per dozen by five.

Finally, I will present the final answer clearly.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine the cost of five dozen oranges at the same rate, follow these steps:

1. **Find the cost per dozen:**

   John purchased three dozen oranges for \$28.80. To find the cost per dozen, divide the total cost by the number of dozens.

   \[
   \text{Cost per dozen} = \frac{\$28.80}{3} = \$9.60 \text{ per dozen}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for five dozen:**

   Now, multiply the cost per dozen by the number of dozens needed.

   \[
   \text{Cost for five dozen} = 5 \times \$9.60 = \$48.00
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{\$48}
   \]</span></div></div>

First, determine how many bags Bianca actually recycled by subtracting the number of bags she did not recycle from the total number of bags she had.

Then, calculate the total points she earned by multiplying the number of recycled bags by the points earned per bag.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of bags Bianca recycled:**

   Bianca had a total of 17 bags but did not recycle 8 of them. Therefore, the number of bags she actually recycled is:
   
   \[
   17 \text{ bags} - 8 \text{ bags} = 9 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total points earned:**

   Bianca earns 5 points for each bag she recycles. For 9 bags, the total points earned are:
   
   \[
   9 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ points/bag} = 45 \text{ points}

First, I need to determine the number of apples and oranges Leif has.

Leif has 14 apples.

He also has 2 dozen oranges. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges he has than apples, I subtract the number of apples from the number of oranges.

24 oranges minus 14 apples equals 10 more oranges than apples.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of apples:**
   \[
   \text{Number of apples} = 14
   \]

2. **Determine the number of oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges} = 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more oranges there are than apples:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of oranges} - \text{Number of apples} = 24 - 14 = 10

First, I need to determine the number of diagonals in a rectangle. A rectangle has four sides, and each vertex connects to two non-adjacent vertices, resulting in two diagonals.

Next, I will add 3 to the number of diagonals. So, 2 diagonals plus 3 equals 5.

Therefore, the final value after adding 3 to the number of diagonals in the rectangle is 5.
&lt;/think>

To find the value of adding 3 to the number of diagonals in a rectangle, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Number of Diagonals in a Rectangle:**
   
   A rectangle has **4 sides**. The formula to calculate the number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) sides is:
   
   \[
   \frac{n(n - 3)}{2}
   \]
   
   Plugging in \( n = 4 \):
   
   \[
   \frac{4(4 - 3)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 1}{2} = 2
   \]
   
   So, a rectangle has **2 diagonals**.

2. **Add 3 to the Number of Diagonals:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ (number of diagonals)} + 3 = 5

First, I need to determine Marguerite's average speed by dividing the distance she drove by the time she took.

Next, I'll use this average speed to calculate how many miles Sam drove by multiplying the speed by the time he spent driving.

Finally, I'll present the calculated distance that Sam drove.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Marguerite's average speed:**

   Marguerite drove 150 miles in 3 hours. To find her average speed:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Determine the distance Sam drove:**

   Sam drove for 4.5 hours at the same average speed of 50 mph. To find the distance he drove:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ mph} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{225 \text{ miles}}
\]</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine how many days the Sumata family spent on their vacation. They drove a total of 1250 miles and covered 250 miles each day.

To find the number of days, I will divide the total miles driven by the miles driven each day.

So, 1250 miles divided by 250 miles per day equals 5 days.

Therefore, the vacation lasted for 5 days.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many days the Sumata family's vacation lasted, we can use the following steps:

1. **Identify the total miles driven:**  
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = 1250 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Identify the miles driven each day:**  
   \[
   \text{Miles per day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days:**  
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{\text{Miles per day}} = \frac{1250 \text{ miles}}{250 \text{ miles/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
   \]

First, I note that Eugene initially has 51.0 pencils.

After giving some pencils to Joyce, Eugene has 45 pencils remaining.

To find out how many pencils Eugene gave to Joyce, I subtract the number of pencils he has left from the initial number of pencils he had.

So, 51.0 pencils minus 45 pencils equals 6 pencils.

Therefore, Eugene gave Joyce 6 pencils.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Eugene initially has **51.0 pencils**. After giving some pencils to Joyce, he is left with **45 pencils**. To find out how many pencils Eugene gave to Joyce, we can use the following steps:

1. **Initial Number of Pencils:**
   \[

First, I note that there are initially 2 birds and 6 storks on the fence.

Then, 3 more birds join them, increasing the total number of birds to 2 + 3 = 5 birds.

To find out how many more storks there are compared to birds, I subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 storks - 5 birds = 1 more stork than birds.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - **Birds:** 2
   - **Storks:** 6

2. **Additional Birds Join:**
   - **Birds Added:** 3
   - **Total Birds Now:** \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)

3. **Comparing Storks and Birds:**

First, I need to determine the total number of pieces of candy Sarah received. She got 66 pieces from her neighbors and 15 pieces from her older sister.

Next, I'll add these two amounts together to find the total number of candies:

66 (from neighbors) + 15 (from sister) = 81 pieces of candy

Sarah ate these candies over a period of 9 days. To find out how many pieces she ate each day, I'll divide the total number of candies by the number of days:

81 pieces ÷ 9 days = 9 pieces per day

Therefore, Sarah ate 9 pieces of candy each day.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many pieces of candy Sarah ate each day, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of candies Sarah received:**

   \[
   \text{Candies from neighbors} + \text{Candies from sister} = 66 + 15 = 81 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pieces Sarah ate each day:**

   \[

First, I need to determine the total weight of the saltwater solution by adding the weight of the salt to the weight of the water.

Next, I will calculate the fraction of the total weight that the salt represents by dividing the weight of the salt by the total weight of the solution.

Finally, I will simplify the fraction to find the simplest form of the answer.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

We are asked to find the fraction of the total weight of the saltwater solution that is accounted for by the salt.

1. **Determine the total weight of the saltwater solution:**

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of salt} + \text{Weight of water} = 6\, \text{kg} + 30\, \text{kg} = 36\, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the fraction of the total weight that is salt:**

   \[
   \text{Fraction of salt} = \frac{\text{Weight of salt}}{\text{Total weight}} = \frac{6\, \text{kg}}{36\, \text{kg}} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   The weight of the salt accounts for \(\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}\) of the total weight of the saltwater solution.

**Final Answer:**

\(\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}\)</span></div></div>

To determine the measure of angle \( G \), we start by noting that angle \( C \) is \( 120^\circ \) and forms a linear pair with angle \( D \). Since linear pairs add up to \( 180^\circ \), we can find angle \( D \) as follows:

\[
D = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

Next, we consider the triangle containing angles \( E \), \( F \), and \( G \). We know that angle \( E \) is \( 50^\circ \) and angle \( F \) is congruent to angle \( D \), so angle \( F \) is also \( 60^\circ \). 

To find angle \( G \), we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):

\[
G = 180^\circ - E - F = 180^\circ - 50^\circ - 60^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of angle \( G \) is \( 70^\circ \).

First, I need to determine how many boxes Jungkook requires to store all 10 balls, with each box holding 5 balls.

To find the number of boxes, I can divide the total number of balls by the number of balls each box can hold.

So, 10 balls divided by 5 balls per box equals 2 boxes.

Therefore, Jungkook needs 2 boxes to store all the balls.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Jungkook has a total of 10 balls and wants to place 5 balls in each box. To find out how many boxes he needs, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of balls:**  
   Jungkook has **10 balls**.

2. **Determine the number of balls per box:**  
   Each box can hold **5 balls**.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**

First, determine the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has by multiplying Scott's pairs by 3.

Next, find out how many pairs Jim has by subtracting 2 from Anthony's total.

Finally, calculate the difference between Anthony's and Jim's pairs of shoes to determine how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim.
&lt;/think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pairs Anthony has:**
   
   Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott.
   
   \[
   \text{Anthony's pairs} = 3 \times \text{Scott's pairs} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pairs Jim has:**
   
   Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.
   
   \[
   \text{Jim's pairs} = \text{Anthony's pairs} - 2 = 21 - 2 = 19
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim:**
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Anthony's pairs} - \text{Jim's pairs} = 21 - 19 = 2

First, I need to determine how many DS games Katie's friends have. I know that Katie has a total of 81 DS games and that she has 22 more games than her friends.

To find out how many games her friends have, I can set up an equation where the number of games her friends have is represented by \( F \).

According to the problem, Katie has 22 more games than her friends, so the equation would be:

\[ 81 = F + 22 \]

To solve for \( F \), I subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 81 - 22 = F \]

\[ 59 = F \]

Therefore, Katie's friends have 59 DS games.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many DS games Katie's friends have.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of DS games Katie's friends have.
   - Katie has 81 DS games.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Katie has 22 more games than her friends. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     81 = F + 22
     \]

3. **Solve for \( F \):**
   - Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation to find \( F \):
     \[
     81 - 22 = F
     \]
     \[
     59 = F
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Katie's friends have \(\boxed{59}\) DS games.</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total length of fishing line John has. He buys 3 reels, each containing 100 meters of fishing line.

Next, I'll calculate the total length by multiplying the number of reels by the length of each reel:
3 reels × 100 meters per reel = 300 meters.

Now, John wants to cut this fishing line into sections of 10 meters each. To find out how many sections he can get, I'll divide the total length by the length of each section:
300 meters ÷ 10 meters per section = 30 sections.

Therefore, John will have 30 sections of 10 meters each.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total length of fishing line:**
   
   John buys **3 reels** of fishing line, each reel being **100 meters** long.
   
   \[
   \text{Total length} = 3 \times 100\, \text{m} = 300\, \text{m}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of 10-meter sections:**
   
   He cuts the total length into sections of **10 meters** each.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{300\, \text{m}}{10\, \text{m/section}} = 30\, \text{sections}

To determine the number of males in the village, we start by noting that the total population is 520 and it is divided into four equal groups. Each group is represented by a rectangle on the graph. 

Since the population is divided equally, each group (rectangle) represents:
\[
\frac{520}{4} = 130
\]
Given that one of these rectangles represents all the males in the village, the number of males is 130.
&lt;/think>

To determine the number of males in the village, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Total Population**: The village has a total population of **520**.

2. **Division into Groups**: The population is divided into **four equal groups**, each represented by a rectangle on the graph.

3. **Equal Group Size**: Since the groups are equal, each group represents:
   \[
   \frac{520}{4} = 130
   \]
   
4. **Males Representation**: It is specified that **one rectangle represents all males** in the village.

5. **Number of Males**: Therefore, the number of males is equal to the size of one group:

First, I need to determine the length of each step on the number line. Since there are nine steps from 0 to 36, I can calculate the length of each step by dividing the total distance by the number of steps.

Next, I'll use the length of each step to find the number \( x \) that is reached after taking six steps from 0. By multiplying the length of each step by six, I can determine the value of \( x \).

Finally, I'll present the calculated value of \( x \) as the answer.
&lt;/think>

To determine the number \( x \) on a number line where the markings are equally spaced and nine steps are taken to get from 0 to 36, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the length of each step:**
   
   Since there are nine steps from 0 to 36, the length of each step is:
   \[
   \text{Step length} = \frac{36}{9} = 4
   \]

2. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   
   If \( x \) is reached after taking six steps from 0, then:
   \[
   x = 6 \times \text{Step length} = 6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The number \( x \) is \(\boxed{B}\).</span></div></div>

First, identify the coordinates of points A and B. Point A is at (1, -1) and point B is at (1, 2).

To find the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), subtract the coordinates of point A from the coordinates of point B.

Calculate the x-component of the vector:
\[
1 - 1 = 0
\]

Calculate the y-component of the vector:
\[
2 - (-1) = 3
\]

Therefore, the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is (0, 3).
&lt;/think>

I need to determine how many bananas each of Jesse's 3 friends will receive if he shares his 21 bananas equally among them.

First, I'll identify the total number of bananas, which is 21.

Next, I'll determine the number of friends, which is 3.

To find out how many bananas each friend gets, I'll divide the total number of bananas by the number of friends.

So, I'll calculate 21 divided by 3.

21 ÷ 3 equals 7.

Therefore, each friend will receive 7 bananas.

**Solution:**

Jesse has a total of **21 bananas** and wants to share them equally among **3 friends**. To find out how many bananas each friend will receive, we can use the division operation.

\[
\text{Number of bananas per friend} = \frac{\text{Total number of bananas}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{21}{3}

First, I need to understand the equation \(632 - AB1 = 41\). Here, \(AB1\) represents a three-digit number where \(A\) and \(B\) are digits.

To isolate \(AB1\), I'll subtract 41 from 632:
\[
632 - 41 = 591
\]
So, \(AB1 = 591\).

Next, I'll compare the digits of \(AB1\) with 591:
- The hundreds place: \(A = 5\)
- The tens place: \(B = 9\)
- The ones place: \(1 = 1\)

From this comparison, it's clear that \(B = 9\).
&lt;/think>

To determine the value of \( B \) in the equation:

\[
632 - AB1 = 41
\]

follow these steps:

1. **Isolate \( AB1 \):**

   \[
   AB1 = 632 - 41
   \]
   
   \[
   AB1 = 591
   \]

2. **Compare the digits:**

   - **Hundreds place:** \( A = 5 \)
   - **Tens place:** \( B = 9 \)
   - **Ones place:** \( 1 = 1 \)

   The value of \( B \) is:

-AB1 = 41 - 632

Now we have:

-AB1 = -591

Since we are looking for a single digit to replace B, we can assume that A is 1 (since AB1 is a three-digit number and we are subtracting it from 632). So the equation becomes:

-1B1 = -591

Now we can add 1B1 to both sides to isolate B:

0 = 1B1 - 591

Now we add 591 to both sides:

1B1 = 591

Since we are looking for a single digit B, we can see that B must be 9 to make the equation true:

191 = 591

So, B = $\boxed{9}$ .</span></div></div>

First, I note that Kamari has 65 toys.

Since Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari, I add 30 to Kamari's number of toys to find out how many toys Anais has.

So, Anais has 65 + 30 = 95 toys.

To find the total number of toys altogether, I add the number of toys Kamari has to the number of toys Anais has.

Therefore, the total number of toys is 65 + 95 = 160.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of toys Anais has:**

   Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari. Since Kamari has 65 toys, we can calculate Anais's toys as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Anais's toys} = \text{Kamari's toys} + 30 = 65 + 30 = 95

2. **Calculate the total number of toys:**

   To find the total number of toys, add the number of toys Kamari has to the number of toys Anais has:
   
   \[
   \text{Total toys} = \text{Kamari's toys} + \text{Anais's toys} = 65 + 95 = 160

First, determine the proportion of the sample relative to the total population. Since 200 students were sampled out of 1,200, the sampling ratio is 1/6.

Next, calculate the total number of female students in the school by multiplying the number of sampled females (85) by the sampling ratio (6):
F = 85 × 6 = 510.

Finally, find the number of male students by subtracting the number of female students from the total number of students:
M = 1,200 - 510 = 690.
&lt;/think>

To determine the number of male students in the school, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Sampling Ratio:**
   - **Total Students:** 1,200
   - **Sample Size:** 200
   - **Sampling Ratio:** \(\frac{200}{1200} = \frac{1}{6}\)

2. **Determine the Number of Female Students:**

First, determine the total number of Pokémon cards Sally has after her purchase. She initially had 27 cards and bought 20 more, so she now has 47 cards.

Next, set up an equation where Sally's total cards are equal to Dan's cards plus 6, since Sally has 6 more cards than Dan. This gives the equation 47 = D + 6.

Finally, solve for D by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, resulting in D = 41. Therefore, Dan has 41 Pokémon cards.
&lt;/think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Sally initially has **27** Pokémon cards.
- Dan has an unknown number of Pokémon cards, which we'll denote as **\( D \)**.
- Sally buys **20** additional Pokémon cards.
- After the purchase, Sally has **6** more Pokémon cards than Dan.

**Step 1: Calculate Sally's Total Pokémon Cards**

Sally's total Pokémon cards after the purchase:
\[
27 \ (\text{initial}) + 20 \ (\text{bought}) = 47 \ \text{cards}
\]

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

According to the problem, Sally now has **6** more cards than Dan:
\[
47 = D + 6
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( D \)**

Subtract **6** from both sides of the equation to find \( D \):
\[
47 - 6 = D
\]
\[
41 = D
\]

Dan has \(\boxed{41}\) Pokémon cards.</span></div></div>

Next, subtract the number of oranges given to the brother from the total to find the remainder.

Then, identify the number of oranges given to the friend, which is provided as 2.

Finally, calculate the ratio of the oranges given to the friend to the remainder after giving to the brother.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 12

2. **Oranges Given to Brother:**
   \[
   \text{Oranges given to brother} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]

3. **Remaining Oranges After Giving to Brother:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining oranges} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Oranges Given to Friend:**
   \[
   \text{Oranges given to friend} = 2
   \]

5. **Ratio of Oranges Given to Friend to the Remainder:**
   \[

1/3 * 12 = 4 oranges

Now, let's find out how many oranges are left after giving some to his brother:

12 - 4 = 8 oranges

The boy then gives a fraction of the remaining 8 oranges to his friend, and we know that his friend gets 2 oranges. 

To find the ratio of the number of oranges given to his friend to the remainder after giving some to his brother, we take the number of oranges the friend gets (2) and divide it by the number of oranges left after giving some to his brother (8):

Ratio = Number of oranges given to friend / Remainder after giving to brother
Ratio = 2 / 8
Ratio = 1 / 4

So, the ratio of the number of oranges given to his friend to the remainder after giving some to his brother is $\boxed{1:4}$ .</span></div></div>

First, I need to find the value of \( g(2) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given as \( x^2 + 2 \). So, substituting \( x = 2 \) into \( g(x) \), I get:

\[ g(2) = 2^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, I need to find \( f(g(2)) \), which is \( f(6) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( 5 - 4x \). Substituting \( x = 6 \) into \( f(x) \), I get:

First, I recognize that Eunjung is the 6th speaker from the back, which means there are 5 students behind her.

Next, there are 7 students in front of Eunjung who will give presentations.

To find the total number of students giving presentations, I add the number of students in front of Eunjung, Eunjung herself, and the students behind her.

So, the calculation is:

7 (students in front) + 1 (Eunjung) + 5 (students behind) = 13 students.
&lt;/think>

To determine the total number of students giving presentations, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Eunjung's Position from the Back:**
   - Eunjung is the **6th speaker from the back**.
   - This means there are **5 students** behind her.

2. **Students in Front of Eunjung:**
   - There are **7 students** in front of Eunjung who will give presentations.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Students:**
   - **Students in front of Eunjung:** 7
   - **Eunjung herself:** 1
   - **Students behind Eunjung:** 5

   Adding these together:
   \[
   7 \, (\text{students in front}) + 1 \, (\text{Eunjung}) + 5 \, (\text{students behind}) = 13 \, \text{students}

First, I need to determine the difference between the cash realized on selling the stock and the cash amount before brokerage. This difference will represent the amount of brokerage paid.

Next, I'll calculate the percentage of the brokerage by dividing the brokerage amount by the cash amount before brokerage and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Finally, I'll present the calculated percentage as the answer.
&lt;/think>

To determine the percentage of the brokerage, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Amount:**

   The difference between the cash realized and the cash amount before brokerage is the brokerage amount.

   \[
   \text{Brokerage Amount} = \text{Cash Realized} - \text{Cash Amount Before Brokerage} = 109.25 - 109 = 0.25 \text{ Rs}
   \]

2. **Determine the Brokerage Percentage:**

   To find the percentage of the brokerage relative to the cash amount before brokerage, use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Brokerage Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Brokerage Amount}}{\text{Cash Amount Before Brokerage}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Brokerage Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.25}{109} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.23\%
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{0.23\%}

The difference between the cash amount before brokerage and the cash realized on selling the stock is:
Rs. 109.25 (cash realized) - Rs. 109 (cash amount before brokerage) = Rs. 0.25 (difference due to brokerage)

Now, to find the percentage of the brokerage, we divide the difference due to brokerage by the cash amount before brokerage and multiply by 100:

Percentage of brokerage = (Difference due to brokerage / Cash amount before brokerage) * 100
Percentage of brokerage = (Rs. 0.25 / Rs. 109) * 100
Percentage of brokerage = 0.2293577981651376 * 100
Percentage of brokerage ≈ 0.23%

First, I need to determine the total number of crickets desired. The user has already collected 7 crickets and needs to collect 4 more.

To find the total number of crickets needed, I add the number of crickets already collected to the number of additional crickets required.

So, 7 crickets (already collected) plus 4 crickets (needed) equals 11 crickets in total.

Therefore, the user needs to collect 4 more crickets to reach a total of 11 crickets.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many more crickets you need to collect, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- You have already collected **7 crickets**.
- You need to collect **4 more crickets**.

**Calculation:**
1. **Total Crickets Needed:**  
   To find the total number of crickets you want to have, add the number of crickets you already have to the number you need to collect:
   \[
   7 \text{ (current crickets)} + 4 \text{ (additional crickets)} = 11 \text{ crickets}
   \]

2. **Cricket Collection Needed:**  
   Since you already have **7 crickets**, the number of additional crickets you need to collect is **4**.

**Final Answer:**
You need to collect \(\boxed{4}\) more crickets to reach a total of **11 crickets**.</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total distance Mr. Welch has already driven. He initially drove 35 miles and then drove an additional 18 miles after stopping for a pie. Adding these together gives a total of 53 miles driven so far.

Next, I will subtract the distance he has already covered from the total distance to Grandma's house to find out how many miles remain. 

78 miles (total distance) minus 53 miles (distance driven) equals 25 miles remaining. 

Therefore, Mr. Welch has 25 miles left to reach Grandma's house.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many more miles Mr. Welch needs to drive to reach Grandma's house, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total miles driven so far:**
   
   - First leg: 35 miles
   - Second leg: 18 miles

   \[
   \text{Total miles driven} = 35 \text{ miles} + 18 \text{ miles} = 53 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining miles to Grandma's house:**
   
   - Total distance to Grandma's house: 78 miles
   - Miles already driven: 53 miles

   \[
   \text{Remaining miles} = 78 \text{ miles} - 53 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}

First, determine the total number of marbles after redistribution by multiplying the number of friends by the marbles each had:
4 friends × 15 marbles each = 60 marbles.

Next, add the initial marbles of Dilan, Martha, and Veronica:
14 (Dilan) + 20 (Martha) + 7 (Veronica) = 41 marbles.

Finally, subtract the sum of their initial marbles from the total after redistribution to find Phillip's initial marbles:
60 total marbles - 41 marbles (Dilan, Martha, Veronica) = 19 marbles.

Phillip initially had 19 marbles.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many marbles Phillip initially had, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Marbles After Redistribution:**
   
   Since each of the four friends ended up with 15 marbles after redistribution:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ marbles}
   \]

2. **Sum the Initial Marbles of Dilan, Martha, and Veronica:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total initial marbles (excluding Phillip)} = 14 \ (\text{Dilan}) + 20 \ (\text{Martha}) + 7 \ (\text{Veronica}) = 41 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. **Determine Phillip's Initial Number of Marbles:**
   
   Subtract the total initial marbles of the other three from the total marbles after redistribution:
   \[
   \text{Phillip's initial marbles} = 60 \ (\text{Total}) - 41 \ (\text{Others}) = 19 \text{ marbles}

4 friends * 15 marbles each = 60 marbles

Now, we know the initial number of marbles Dilan, Martha, and Veronica had:
Dilan had 14 marbles
Martha had 20 marbles
Veronica had 7 marbles

Adding these together gives us the total number of marbles they had before redistribution, excluding Phillip:
14 (Dilan) + 20 (Martha) + 7 (Veronica) = 41 marbles

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of marbles after redistribution to find out how many marbles Phillip had initially:

To determine the original number, let's denote it as \( x \). The problem states that when 4 is added to \( x \), the sum is completely divisible by 23. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
x + 4 \equiv 0 \mod 23

To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x \equiv -4 \mod 23
\]

Since we are looking for a positive number, we can add 23 to -4 to find the smallest positive equivalent:

\[
x \equiv 19 \mod 23

To determine the imaginary part of the complex number \( z = 2 - i \), I start by recalling the standard form of a complex number, which is \( a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part.

In the given complex number \( z = 2 - i \), the real part is clearly \( 2 \). The imaginary part is the coefficient of \( i \), which in this case is \( -1 \).

Therefore, the imaginary part of \( z = 2 - i \) is \(-1\).
&lt;/think>

To determine the imaginary part of the complex number \( z = 2 - i \), let's analyze its components.

A complex number is generally expressed in the form:
\[
z = a + bi
\]
where:
- \( a \) is the **real part**,
- \( b \) is the **imaginary part**,
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property \( i^2 = -1 \).

Given the complex number:
\[
z = 2 - i
\]
We can rewrite it in the standard form:
\[
z = 2 + (-1)i
\]
From this, it is clear that:
- The **real part** (\( a \)) is \( 2 \),
- The **imaginary part** (\( b \)) is \( -1 \).

Therefore, the imaginary part of the complex number \( z = 2 - i \) is:

First, I need to calculate 80% of 45. To do this, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives me 0.80. Then, I'll multiply 0.80 by 45 to find the value.

Next, I'll calculate 4/5 of 25. To simplify this, I'll divide 25 by 5 to get 5, and then multiply by 4 to find the result.

Finally, I'll subtract the second result from the first to determine how much greater 80% of 45 is compared to 4/5 of 25.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

We need to determine how much greater 80% of 45 is compared to \(\frac{4}{5}\) of 25.

1. **Calculate 80% of 45:**

\[

2. **Calculate \(\frac{4}{5}\) of 25:**

\[
\frac{4}{5} \text{ of } 25 = \frac{4}{5} \times 25 = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

3. **Find the difference between the two results:**

1. **Find the cost of a slice of cake**: Given that the cost of a slice of cake is three-fourths of the cost of a cup of milk tea, and knowing that a cup of milk tea costs $2.40, we calculate the cost of a slice of cake as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a slice of cake} = \$2.40 \times \frac{3}{4} = \$1.80.

2. **Calculate the cost for 2 slices of cake**: Now that we know a single slice of cake costs $1.80, we can find the cost of 2 slices by multiplying:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 2 slices of cake} = \$1.80 \times 2 = \$3.60.

To determine the number of houses in a block, I start by noting that she receives 7 pieces of candy from each house.

She estimates receiving a total of 35 candies from each block.

To find the number of houses, I divide the total number of candies by the number of candies received per house.

This calculation is 35 candies divided by 7 candies per house, which equals 5 houses.

Therefore, there are 5 houses in a block.
&lt;/think>

To determine the number of houses in a block, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of candies received from one block:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total candies per block} = 35 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of candies received from each house:**
   
   \[
   \text{Candies per house} = 7 \text{ candies/house}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of houses in a block by dividing the total candies by the candies per house:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of houses} = \frac{\text{Total candies per block}}{\text{Candies per house}} = \frac{35}{7} = 5
   \]

4. **Present the final answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \]

First, determine the number of marbles in each bag by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of bags.

Next, calculate how many marbles James has given away by subtracting the remaining marbles from the total number of marbles.

Finally, find out how many bags James gave away by dividing the number of marbles he gave away by the number of marbles in each bag.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of marbles in each bag:**

   James has a total of 28 marbles and he puts them equally into 4 bags.

   \[
   \text{Marbles per bag} = \frac{28}{4} = 7
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of marbles James gave away:**

   James has 21 marbles left after giving away some bags.

   \[
   \text{Marbles given away} = 28 - 21 = 7
   \]

3. **Find out how many bags James gave away:**

   Since each bag contains 7 marbles, the number of bags given away is:

   \[
   \text{Bags given away} = \frac{7}{7} = 1
   \]

First, I need to understand the relationships between the number of clothes each person bought. It's given that Dad bought more clothes than Mom, and Grandpa bought more clothes than Dad.

This means the order from least to most clothes bought is Mom, then Dad, and finally Grandpa.

When arranging them in ascending order based on the number of clothes, Mom would be in the first position.
&lt;/think>

Let's determine the position of Mom when lining up the people based on the number of clothes they bought in ascending order.

### Given:
1. **Dad bought more clothes than Mom.**
2. **Grandpa bought more clothes than Dad.**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Order of Clothes Bought:**
   - From the given information:
     - **Mom** bought the **least** number of clothes.
     - **Dad** bought more than Mom.
     - **Grandpa** bought the **most** clothes.
   - Therefore, the order from **least** to **most** clothes bought is:
     \[
     \text{Mom} &lt; \text{Dad} &lt; \text{Grandpa}
     \]

2. **Assign Positions Based on the Order:**
   - **1st Position:** Mom (least clothes)
   - **2nd Position:** Dad
   - **3rd Position:** Grandpa (most clothes)

### Conclusion:
When lined up in ascending order based on the number of clothes bought, **Mom** will be in the **first position**.

To compare the numbers \(-9\) and \(-2\), I start by understanding that both are negative numbers. In the context of negative numbers, the number with the larger absolute value is actually smaller. 

First, I determine the absolute values:
- The absolute value of \(-9\) is \(|-9| = 9\).
- The absolute value of \(-2\) is \(|-2| = 2\).

Since \(9\) is greater than \(2\), \(-9\) is less than \(-2\). This is because, on the number line, \(-9\) is positioned to the left of \(-2\), indicating that it is smaller.

Therefore, the correct comparison is \(-9 &lt; -2\).
&lt;/think>

To compare the numbers \(-9\) and \(-2\), follow these steps:

1. **Understand Negative Numbers:**
   - Negative numbers decrease in value as their magnitude increases.
   - On the number line, \(-9\) is to the left of \(-2\), indicating that \(-9\) is smaller than \(-2\).

2. **Compare the Magnitudes:**
   - The absolute value of \(-9\) is \(9\).
   - The absolute value of \(-2\) is \(2\).
   - Since \(9 > 2\), \(-9\) is less than \(-2\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, \(-9\) is less than \(-2\).

First, I recognize that the income and expenditure are in the ratio 7:6. This means I can represent the income as 7 times a common variable and the expenditure as 6 times the same variable.

Next, I know that savings are calculated by subtracting expenditure from income. The problem states that the savings amount to Rs. 3000. By setting up the equation 7x - 6x = 3000, I can solve for the common variable x.

Simplifying the equation, I find that x equals 3000. Finally, I calculate the income by multiplying 7 by x, which gives me the total income of Rs. 21000.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's denote the income and expenditure of the person as follows:

- **Income** = \( 7x \)
- **Expenditure** = \( 6x \)

where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the person saves Rs. 3000. Savings can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Income} - \text{Expenditure}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
3000 = 7x - 6x
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
3000 = x
\]

Now, to find the income:

\[
\text{Income} = 7x = 7 \times 3000 = 21000
\]

**Therefore, the person's income is \(\boxed{21000}\) rupees.**</span></div></div>

According to the problem, the person saves Rs. 3000. We can express savings as the difference between income and expenditure:

Savings = Income - Expenditure

Given that the savings are Rs. 3000, we can write:

3000 = 7x - 6x

This simplifies to:

3000 = x

So the common multiplier x is Rs. 3000.

Now, to find the income, we multiply the income ratio by the common multiplier:

Income = 7x = 7 * 3000 = Rs. 21000

Therefore, the person's income is Rs. $\boxed{21000}$ .</span></div></div>

Next, determine the capacity of each large seat, which is 12 people.

To find the total number of people that can ride on the large seats, multiply the number of large seats by the capacity of each large seat.

So, 7 large seats multiplied by 12 people per seat equals 84 people.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of large seats:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of large seats} = 7

First, I need to determine the speed of the train in meters per second by dividing the length of the train by the time it takes to cross the electric pole.

Next, I'll convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour using the conversion factor of 3.6.

Finally, I'll present the calculated speed in kilometers per hour as the final answer.
&lt;/think>

To determine the speed of the train, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the speed in meters per second (m/s):**

   The train crosses an electric pole, meaning it covers a distance equal to its own length. 

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{140 \text{ meters}}{2.3998080153587713 \text{ seconds}} \approx 58.343 \text{ m/s}
   \]

2. **Convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour (km/hr):**

   To convert from m/s to km/hr, multiply by the conversion factor \(3.6\):

   \[
   \text{Speed in km/hr} = 58.343 \text{ m/s} \times 3.6 \approx 210.0348 \text{ km/hr}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{210.0348 \text{ km/hr}}
   \]</span></div></div>

Speed = Distance / Time

The distance the train covers when it crosses the electric pole is equal to the length of the train, which is 140 meters. The time taken to cross the pole is given as 2.3998080153587713 seconds.

Let's plug these values into the formula:

Speed = 140 meters / 2.3998080153587713 seconds

Now, let's calculate the speed:

Speed = 140 / 2.3998080153587713
Speed ≈ 58.343 m/s

However, the question asks for the speed in km/hr. To convert meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/hr), we use the conversion factor:

1 m/s = 3.6 km/hr

So, we multiply the speed in m/s by 3.6 to get the speed in km/hr:

Speed in km/hr = 58.343 m/s * 3.6 km/hr per m/s
Speed in km/hr ≈ 210.0348 km/hr

Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately $\boxed{210.0348}$  km/hr.</span></div></div>

First, I need to solve the equation \(3a + 2 = 2\) to find the value of \(a\). 

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives:
\[
3a = 0
\]
Then, dividing both sides by 3:
\[
a = 0
\]

Next, I substitute \(a = 0\) into the second equation \(b - 2a = 3\):
\[
b - 2(0) = 3
\]
Simplifying:
\[
b = 3
\]

Therefore, the value of \(b\) is \(\boxed{3}\).

To find the value of \( b \), follow these steps:

1. **Solve for \( a \) using the first equation:**
   \[
   3a + 2 = 2

   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   3a = 0

First, I need to determine the total number of puppies at the shelter. Initially, there are 10 puppies, and another 15 are brought in. Adding these together gives a total of 25 puppies.

Next, I know that 7 puppies are adopted each day. To find out how many days it will take for all 25 puppies to be adopted, I divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day: 25 ÷ 7 = 3.57 days.

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a day in this context, I round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 4 days for all the puppies to be adopted.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Initial puppies} + \text{Additional puppies} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ puppies}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required for adoption:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total puppies} \div \text{Puppies adopted per day} = 25 \div 7 \approx 3.57 \text{ days}
   \]
   
   Since you can't have a fraction of a day in this context, we round up to the nearest whole day.

   \[
   \boxed{4 \text{ days}}

First, I need to determine the total number of plates the chef made, which is 55.

Next, I'll add the number of plates of lobster rolls and spicy hot noodles: 25 + 14 = 39.

Finally, I'll subtract this sum from the total number of plates to find out how many plates of seafood noodles were made: 55 - 39 = 16.

Therefore, the chef made 16 plates of seafood noodles.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many plates of seafood noodles the chef made, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of plates:**
   \[
   \text{Total plates} = 55
   \]

2. **Determine the number of plates for the other two foods:**
   \[
   \text{Lobster rolls} = 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Spicy hot noodles} = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of plates for lobster rolls and spicy hot noodles:**
   \[
   \text{Total of lobster rolls and spicy hot noodles} = 25 + 14 = 39
   \]

4. **Subtract this total from the overall number of plates to find the number of seafood noodle plates:**
   \[
   \text{Seafood noodles} = \text{Total plates} - \text{Total of lobster rolls and spicy hot noodles}
   \]
   \[

To subtract 444.44 from 888.88, I will first align the numbers by their decimal points to ensure each digit is in the correct place value.

Starting with the hundredths place, I subtract 4 from 8, which gives me 4. Moving to the tenths place, I subtract another 4 from 8, resulting in 4. In the ones place, subtracting 4 from 8 again gives 4. Repeating this process for the tens and hundreds places, each subtraction yields 4. 

After performing all the subtractions, the result is 444.44. Since the result is already precise to the hundredth place, no further rounding is needed.
&lt;/think>

To subtract \(444.44\) from \(888.88\), follow these steps:

1. **Align the numbers by their decimal points:**

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\ \ 888.88 \\
-444.44 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

2. **Subtract each corresponding digit starting from the right:**

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\ \ 888.88 \\
-444.44 \\
\hline
\ \ 444.44 \\
\end{array}
\]

3. **The result of the subtraction is \(444.44\).**

4. **Since the result is already precise to the hundredth place, no further rounding is needed.**

First, I need to determine the total number of games Edward purchased. He bought 41 games from a friend and an additional 14 games at a garage sale.

Next, I'll add these two quantities together to find the total number of games:
41 games + 14 games = 55 games.

Edward found out that 31 of these games didn't work. To find out how many games are in good condition, I'll subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games:
55 games - 31 games = 24 games.

Therefore, Edward ended up with 24 good games.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many good games Edward ended up with.

1. **Total Games Purchased:**
   
   - **From a friend:** 41 games
   - **From a garage sale:** 14 games

   \[
   \text{Total games} = 41 + 14 = 55 \text{ games}
   \]

2. **Games That Didn't Work:**
   
   - **Non-working games:** 31 games

3. **Good Games:**
   
   To find the number of good games, subtract the non-working games from the total games.

   \[
   \text{Good games} = \text{Total games} - \text{Non-working games} = 55 - 31 = 24 \text{ games}
   \]

\[
\boxed{24}

First, I need to determine how many wristbands each spectator received. The problem states that wristbands were given to every spectator for both their hands, which means each person received 2 wristbands.

Next, I'll use the total number of wristbands distributed, which is 234, to find out how many people attended the game. Since each person received 2 wristbands, I can divide the total number of wristbands by the number of wristbands per person to find the number of people.

So, I'll divide 234 by 2 to get the number of people who watched the game.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many people watched the game, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Each spectator received **2 wristbands** (one for each hand).
- The **total number of wristbands distributed** was **234**.

**Step 1: Understand the Distribution**
- Every person received **2 wristbands**.

**Step 2: Calculate the Number of People**
- To find the number of people, divide the total number of wristbands by the number of wristbands each person received.

\[
\text{Number of people} = \frac{\text{Total wristbands}}{\text{Wristbands per person}} = \frac{234}{2} = 117
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{117}
\]

So, **117 people** watched the game.</span></div></div>

First, I need to compute the expression \(12 \cdot \frac{1}{15} \cdot 30\).

I can start by simplifying the multiplication of the fractions and the whole numbers. Multiplying \(\frac{1}{15}\) by 30 gives me \(\frac{30}{15}\), which simplifies to 2.

Now, the expression becomes \(12 \cdot 2\). Multiplying 12 by 2 results in 24.

Therefore, the final answer is 24.
&lt;/think>

To compute \(12 \cdot \frac{1}{15} \cdot 30\), follow these steps:

1. **Multiply the fractions and whole numbers:**
   \[
   12 \cdot \frac{1}{15} \cdot 30
   \]

2. **Simplify the multiplication of \(\frac{1}{15}\) and 30:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{15} \cdot 30 = \frac{30}{15} = 2
   \]

3. **Now, multiply 12 by the result from step 2:**
   \[
   12 \cdot 2 = 24
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{24}

First, I need to determine the speed of the train using the information provided.

The train is 500 meters long and crosses an electric pole in 20 seconds. When the train crosses the pole, it travels a distance equal to its own length.

So, the distance traveled is 500 meters, and the time taken is 20 seconds.

To find the speed, I'll use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Plugging in the values:

Speed = 500 meters / 20 seconds = 25 meters per second

Therefore, the speed of the train is 25 meters per second.
&lt;/think>

To determine the speed of the train, we can use the basic formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

**Given:**
- Length of the train (\(D\)) = 500 meters
- Time taken to cross the electric pole (\(T\)) = 20 seconds

**Step 1:** Understand that when the train crosses the electric pole, it travels a distance equal to its own length.

**Step 2:** Plug the given values into the speed formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{500 \text{ meters}}{20 \text{ seconds}} = 25 \text{ meters/second}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{25 \text{ meters per second}}

First, recognize that the pumping rate is 500 gallons per hour.

Next, determine the fraction of an hour that 30 minutes represents. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half of an hour, or 0.5 hours.

Finally, multiply the pumping rate by the time to find the total volume of water pumped:
500 gallons/hour × 0.5 hours = 250 gallons.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many gallons of water the Ponde family's Powerjet will pump in **30 minutes**, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Pumping Rate:**
   
   The Powerjet pumps **500 gallons per hour**.

2. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   
   Since there are **60 minutes** in an hour, **30 minutes** is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Volume Pumped in 30 Minutes:**
   
   Multiply the pumping rate by the time in hours:
   \[
   500 \text{ gallons/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 250 \text{ gallons}
   \]

First, I need to determine the total area of Joel's garden, which is given as 64 square feet.

Joel plans to divide his garden equally between fruits and vegetables. Therefore, I will calculate the area allocated for fruits by dividing the total area by 2:
64 ÷ 2 = 32 square feet.

Next, Joel wants to use a quarter of the fruit section specifically for strawberries. To find the area for strawberries, I will take a quarter of the 32 square feet allocated for fruits:
32 ÷ 4 = 8 square feet.

Thus, the area of the garden that will be used for strawberries is 8 square feet.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Garden Area:**
   
   Joel's garden has a total area of:
   \[
   64 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Area Allocated for Fruits:**
   
   Joel wants to use half of the garden for fruits. Therefore, the area for fruits is:

First, I need to find the number when 20% of it equals 200. To do this, I'll set up the equation 0.20 * x = 200, where x is the unknown number.

Next, I'll solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.20. This gives me x = 200 / 0.20, which simplifies to x = 1000.

Now that I know the number is 1000, I can find 120% of it by multiplying 1000 by 1.20. This calculation results in 1200.

Therefore, 120% of the number is 1200.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

We are given that **20%** of a number equals **200**. Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \).

1. **Set up the equation:**
   
   \[
   20\% \times x = 200
   \]
   
   This can be written as:
   
   \[
   0.20 \times x = 200
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{0.20}
   \]
   
   \[
   x = 1000
   \]

3. **Find 120% of the number:**
   
   \[
   120\% \times x = 1.20 \times 1000 = 1200
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1200}

First, I need to determine the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens over the 3 days. Eric collected 36 eggs in total.

Next, I'll calculate the number of eggs laid per day by dividing the total eggs by the number of days: 36 eggs ÷ 3 days = 12 eggs per day.

Since each chicken lays 3 eggs per day, I can find out how many chickens there are by dividing the number of eggs laid per day by the number of eggs each chicken lays: 12 eggs per day ÷ 3 eggs per chicken = 4 chickens.

Therefore, Eric has 4 chickens on his farm.
&lt;/think>

To determine how many chickens Eric has on his farm, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Each chicken lays **3 eggs** per day.
- After **3 days**, Eric collected a total of **36 eggs**.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Laid Per Day**

First, find out how many eggs are laid by all the chickens in one day.

\[
\text{Total eggs per day} = \frac{\text{Total eggs collected}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{36 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ days}} = 12 \text{ eggs/day}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Chickens**

Since each chicken lays **3 eggs** per day, we can find the number of chickens by dividing the total eggs laid per day by the number of eggs each chicken lays.

\[
\text{Number of chickens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs per day}}{\text{Eggs per chicken per day}} = \frac{12 \text{ eggs/day}}{3 \text{ eggs/day/chicken}} = 4 \text{ chickens}
\]

Okay, let's see. So, Paul made some money mowing lawns and some money weed eating. He made $44 from mowing lawns, and we don't know how much he made from weed eating. But we do know that if he spends $9 a week, his money will last him 8 weeks. So, I need to figure out how much he made from weed eating.

First, maybe I should figure out how much money Paul has in total. If he spends $9 each week and this lasts him 8 weeks, then the total amount of money he has must be enough to cover 8 weeks of spending. So, I can calculate that by multiplying $9 by 8. Let me do that: 9 times 8 is 72. So, Paul has $72 in total.

Now, out of this $72, we know that $44 came from mowing lawns. So, the rest must have come from weed eating. To find out how much he made from weed eating, I can subtract the $44 he made from mowing lawns from the total $72. So, 72 minus 44 equals... let me calculate that. 72 minus 40 is 32, and then minus 4 more is 28. So, Paul made $28 from weed eating.

Wait, let me double-check that. If he made $44 from mowing and $28 from weed eating, that adds up to $72. And if he spends $9 a week, then 72 divided by 9 is 8 weeks. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think $28 is the right answer.
&lt;/think>

Paul made $28 from weed eating.</span></div></div>

If Paul spent $9 a week and the money lasted him 8 weeks, then we can calculate the total amount of money he had by multiplying the weekly spending by the number of weeks:

Total money = Weekly spending × Number of weeks
Total money = $9/week × 8 weeks
Total money = $72

Now we know that Paul had $72 in total. We also know that he made $44 from mowing lawns. To find out how much he made from weed eating, we subtract the money he made from mowing lawns from the total amount of money he had:

Money made weed eating = Total money - Money made mowing lawns
Money made weed eating = $72 - $44
Money made weed eating = $28

Therefore, Paul made $\boxed{\$28}$  from weed eating.</span></div></div>

First, I need to understand the notation provided. The phrase "$8$ in row $4$" is denoted as $\left(8,4\right)$. This indicates that the first number represents the element or number itself, and the second number represents the row in which this element is located.

Next, I apply this understanding to the new phrase "$3$ in row $5$". Here, the element is $3$, and it is located in row $5$. Following the same pattern, I pair the element with its corresponding row number.

Therefore, "$3$ in row $5$" is denoted as $\left(3,5\right)$.
&lt;/think>

To determine how to denote "$3$ in row $5$" based on the given notation, let's follow the pattern established by the example:

1. **Understanding the Given Notation:**
   - The phrase "$8$ in row $4$" is denoted as $\left(8,4\right)$.
   - Here, the **first number** represents the **element** or **number**, and the **second number** represents the **row** in which this element is located.

2. **Applying the Same Pattern:**
   - For the phrase "$3$ in row $5$":
     - The **element** is $3$.
     - The **row** is $5$.
   - Following the notation pattern, we pair the element with its corresponding row number.

3. **Final Denotation:**
   - Therefore, "$3$ in row $5$" is denoted as:
     \[
     \boxed{\left(3,5\right)}
     \]</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total number of baseball cards Will has. He has 8 new cards and 10 old cards.

Next, I'll add the number of new and old cards together to find the total number of cards:
8 new cards + 10 old cards = 18 cards

Now, I know that Will can place 3 cards on each page of the binder. To find out how many pages he will use, I'll divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:
18 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 6 pages

Therefore, Will will use 6 pages to organize all his baseball cards in the binder.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many pages Will will use to organize his baseball cards, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{New cards} + \text{Old cards} = 8 + 10 = 18 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pages needed:**
   
   Since Will can place **3 cards** on each page, divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of pages} = \frac{\text{Total cards}}{\text{Cards per page}} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ pages}

First, calculate the total number of individual shoes Marcella originally has by multiplying the number of pairs by 2: 27 pairs × 2 = 54 individual shoes.

Next, determine the number of individual shoes that remain after losing some. If she has 22 pairs left, that means she has 22 × 2 = 44 individual shoes still in pairs.

Finally, subtract the remaining individual shoes from the original total to find out how many shoes she lost: 54 - 44 = 10 individual shoes lost.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Marcella initially has **27 pairs** of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 individual shoes, the total number of individual shoes she has is:

\[
27 \text{ pairs} \times 2 = 54 \text{ individual shoes}
\]

After losing some individual shoes, the greatest number of matching pairs she could have left is **22 pairs**. Therefore, the number of individual shoes that remain in pairs is:

\[
22 \text{ pairs} \times 2 = 44 \text{ individual shoes}
\]

To find out how many individual shoes Marcella lost, subtract the number of individual shoes that remain in pairs from the original total:

\[
54 \text{ (original individual shoes)} - 44 \text{ (individual shoes remaining)} = 10 \text{ individual shoes lost}

First, I need to identify the unknown number, which I'll call "x."

The problem states that when five is added to three more than this number, the result is 19. This can be written as the equation:
5 + (x + 3) = 19

Next, I'll simplify the equation by combining like terms:
x + 8 = 19

To solve for x, I'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
x = 19 - 8
x = 11

Therefore, the certain number is 11.
&lt;/think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
When five is added to three more than a certain number, the result is 19. What is the number?

**Solution:**

1. **Let the certain number be \( x \).**

2. **Three more than the number:**
   \[
   x + 3
   \]

3. **Five added to three more than the number:**
   \[
   5 + (x + 3)
   \]

4. **According to the problem, this equals 19:**
   \[
   5 + (x + 3) = 19
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   x + 8 = 19
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 19 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 11
   \]

The certain number is \(\boxed{11}\).</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total number of Valentines Mrs. Wong gave away. She gave 8 Valentines to her children, 5 to her neighbors, and 3 to her coworkers. Adding these together, 8 plus 5 equals 13, and 13 plus 3 equals 16. So, she gave away a total of 16 Valentines.

Next, I'll subtract the total number of Valentines given away from the original number she had. Mrs. Wong started with 30 Valentines. Subtracting the 16 Valentines she gave away from 30 gives me 14.

Therefore, Mrs. Wong has 14 Valentines left.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Mrs. Wong started with **30** Valentines. She distributed them as follows:

- **8** Valentines to her children
- **5** Valentines to her neighbors
- **3** Valentines to her coworkers

First, I need to determine the desired overall average percentage based on the student's scores in three subjects.

The student has already achieved 74% in Math and 81% in History. The student aims to score 70% in the third subject to reach a certain overall average.

To find the overall average, I will add the scores of all three subjects and then divide by the number of subjects.

So, I will add 74%, 81%, and 70% to get the total percentage.

Next, I will divide this total by 3 to calculate the average percentage.

Finally, this will give me the desired overall average percentage.
&lt;/think>

To determine the desired overall average percentage, follow these steps:

1. **List the given percentages:**
   - **Math:** 74%
   - **History:** 81%
   - **Third Subject:** 70%

2. **Calculate the total percentage:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Percentage} = 74\% + 81\% + 70\% = 225\%
   \]

3. **Determine the overall average percentage:**
   
   \[
   \text{Overall Average} = \frac{\text{Total Percentage}}{\text{Number of Subjects}} = \frac{225\%}{3} = 75\%
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{75\%}
   \]</span></div></div>

The overall average is calculated by adding the percentages of all subjects and dividing by the number of subjects. In this case, there are three subjects. So the formula for the overall average is:

A = (Math percentage + History percentage + Third subject percentage) / 3

We know the Math percentage is 74%, the History percentage is 81%, and the Third subject percentage is 70%. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

A = (74 + 81 + 70) / 3

Now, let's calculate the sum of the percentages:

74 + 81 + 70 = 225

Now, we divide this sum by 3 to find the overall average:

A = 225 / 3
A = 75

So, the desired overall average percentage is $\boxed{75\%}$ .</span></div></div>

First, identify the number of players in the tournament, which is 10.

Each player will play against every other player exactly once. This means each player will have 9 matches.

If we simply multiply the number of players by the number of matches each player has, we get 10 × 9 = 90. However, this counts each match twice because each match involves two players.

To find the actual number of unique matches, we need to divide the total by 2.

So, 90 divided by 2 equals 45.

Therefore, there will be 45 unique matches in the tournament.
&lt;/think>

To determine the number of matches in a 10-person round-robin tennis tournament where each player plays every other player exactly once, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Round-Robin Format:**
   - In a round-robin tournament, each participant plays against every other participant exactly once.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Matches:**
   - For **n** players, each player plays **n - 1** matches.
   - However, this counts each match twice (once for each participant). To get the actual number of unique matches, divide by 2.

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]
   - Plugging in **n = 10**:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{45}
   \]

So, there will be **45** matches in total during the tournament.</span></div></div>

- Each player will play against each other player exactly once, therefore each player plays $n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$ matches.
- Reasoning similarly, to count all matches without duplication, we consider the fact that each match is counted twice when summing up all individual counts (AB and BA are the same match).

The formula to find the total number of matches when each player plays every other player exactly once is given by $\frac{n \times (n-1)}{2}$. This accounts for each match only once.

Applying this formula:
\[
\frac{10 \times 9}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

Thus, the number of matches in a 10-player round-robin tennis tournament is $\boxed{45}$.</span></div></div>

First, I recognize that Sheela deposits Rs. 2500, which represents 25% of her monthly income.

To find her total monthly income, I need to determine what amount 25% corresponds to Rs. 2500.

I can set up the equation: 25% of the monthly income equals Rs. 2500.

Converting 25% to a decimal gives 0.25.

So, 0.25 multiplied by the monthly income equals Rs. 2500.

To solve for the monthly income, I divide Rs. 2500 by 0.25.

This calculation yields Rs. 10,000 as Sheela's monthly income.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Sheela deposits **Rs. 2500**, which is **25%** of her monthly income. To find her total monthly income, follow these steps:

1. **Let the monthly income be \( x \).**

2. **According to the problem:**
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } x = 2500
   \]
   
3. **Convert the percentage to a decimal:**
   \[
   0.25 \times x = 2500
   \]
   
4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{2500}{0.25}
   \]
   
5. **Calculate the division:**
   \[
   x = 10000
   \]
   
**Therefore, Sheela's monthly income is \(\boxed{10000}\) rupees.**</span></div></div>

Okay, so I need to figure out how many candy bars Carl can buy after four weeks. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I understand everything correctly.

First, Carl earns money by taking out his neighbor's trash. His neighbor pays him $0.75 every week for this service. So, over four weeks, Carl will earn:
\[
0.75 \times 4 = \$3.00
\]
Got that part. Now, Carl uses this money to buy candy bars. Every time he earns $0.50, he buys a candy bar. So, with the total amount he earned, which is $3.00, I need to find out how many $0.50 portions are in $3.00.

To do this, I'll divide the total amount Carl has by the cost of one candy bar:
\[
\frac{3.00}{0.50} = 6
\]
So, Carl can buy 6 candy bars with the $3.00 he earned over four weeks.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If Carl earns $0.75 each week, over four weeks that's:
\[
0.75 \times 4 = 3.00
\]
Yes, that's correct. And each candy bar costs $0.50, so dividing $3.00 by $0.50 gives:
\[
\frac{3.00}{0.50} = 6
\]
That still adds up. So, it looks like Carl can indeed buy 6 candy bars.

I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to ensure there are no errors. It seems straightforward, but it's always good to verify each part of the problem to be certain.
&lt;/think>

At the end of four weeks, Carl will be able to buy **6 candy bars**.</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total number of servings Phoebe and her dog consume each day. Phoebe eats 1 serving, and she gives her dog 1 serving, so together they consume 2 servings per day.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of servings available in 4 jars of peanut butter. Each jar contains 15 servings, so 4 jars will have 4 multiplied by 15, which equals 60 servings.

Finally, to find out how many days the peanut butter will last, I'll divide the total number of servings by the daily consumption. Dividing 60 servings by 2 servings per day gives me 30 days.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the daily consumption:**
   
   - Phoebe eats **1 serving** of peanut butter.
   - She gives her dog **1 serving** of peanut butter.
   - **Total daily consumption** = 1 serving (Phoebe) + 1 serving (Dog) = **2 servings per day**.

2. **Calculate the total number of servings in 4 jars:**
   
   - Each jar contains **15 servings**.
   - Total servings in **4 jars** = 4 jars × 15 servings/jar = **60 servings**.

3. **Determine how many days the peanut butter will last:**
   
   - Total servings available = **60 servings**.
   - Daily consumption = **2 servings/day**.
   - Number of days the peanut butter will last = Total servings ÷ Daily consumption = 60 servings ÷ 2 servings/day = **30 days**.

**Final Answer:**

First, I need to determine the dividend (D) using the correct divisor and quotient. Since the correct divisor is 21 and the correct quotient is 20, I can calculate D as follows:

D = 21 * 20 = 420

Next, I need to find out the mistaken quotient when the student used 12 as the divisor instead of 21. Using the same dividend:

Mistaken Quotient = D / 12 = 420 / 12 = 35

Therefore, the student obtained a quotient of 35 by mistake.
&lt;/think>

To determine the quotient the student obtained by mistake, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - **Correct Divisor (D₁):** 21
   - **Mistaken Divisor (D₂):** 12
   - **Correct Quotient (Q₁):** 20
   - **Remainder (R):** 0

2. **Find the Dividend (N):**
   
   The dividend can be calculated using the correct divisor and quotient:
   \[
   N = D₁ \times Q₁ = 21 \times 20 = 420
   \]

3. **Calculate the Mistaken Quotient (Q₂):**
   
   Using the mistaken divisor:
   \[
   Q₂ = \frac{N}{D₂} = \frac{420}{12} = 35
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   The quotient the student obtained by mistake is:
   \[

First, I need to determine how many windows are left to install. The building requires a total of 9 windows, and the builder has already installed 6 windows.

So, the number of windows left to install is:
9 windows - 6 windows = 3 windows

Next, I know that it will take the builder 18 hours to install these remaining 3 windows. To find out how long it takes to install one window, I can divide the total time by the number of windows left.

18 hours ÷ 3 windows = 6 hours per window

Therefore, it takes 6 hours to install one window.
&lt;/think>

To determine how long it takes to install one window, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of windows left to install:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total windows needed} - \text{Windows already installed} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ windows}
   \]

2. **Determine the time required to install the remaining windows:**
   
   It will take **18 hours** to install the remaining **3 windows**.

3. **Find the time it takes to install one window:**
   
   \[
   \text{Time per window} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of windows}} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ windows}} = 6 \text{ hours per window}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{6}

Okay, so I need to figure out how many total sides there are when Tom and Tim both bring 4 six-sided dice to school. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that each die has 6 sides. That's pretty straightforward. Now, Tom brought 4 dice, and Tim also brought 4 dice. So, together, they have 4 plus 4 dice. Let me write that down: 4 (Tom's dice) + 4 (Tim's dice) = 8 dice in total.

Now, each of these dice has 6 sides. So, if I want to find out the total number of sides, I need to multiply the number of dice by the number of sides per die. That would be 8 dice * 6 sides per die.

Let me do the multiplication: 8 * 6 = 48.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If one die has 6 sides, then 4 dice would have 24 sides. So, Tom has 24 sides, and Tim also has 24 sides. Adding those together, 24 + 24 = 48. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.

So, it looks like the total number of sides is 48.
&lt;/think>

To determine the total number of sides when Tom and Tim each bring 4 six-sided dice to school, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of dice:**
   - Tom brings 4 dice.
   - Tim brings 4 dice.
   - Total dice = 4 (Tom) + 4 (Tim) = **8 dice**.

2. **Determine the number of sides per die:**
   - Each die has 6 sides.

3. **Calculate the total number of sides:**
   - Total sides = Total dice × Sides per die
   - Total sides = 8 × 6 = **48 sides**.

**Final Answer:**  
There are **48** total sides.</span></div></div>

Let the two real numbers be \( x \) and \( y \). We are given that their sum is 3 times their product, which can be written as:

\[ x + y = 3xy \]

We need to find the sum of the reciprocals of these two numbers, which is \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} \).

To find this, we can manipulate the given equation. First, divide both sides of the equation by \( xy \):

\[ \frac{x}{xy} + \frac{y}{xy} = \frac{3xy}{xy} \]

Simplifying each term, we get:

First, I need to determine the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother. I know that there are 12 good carrots and 16 bad carrots, so the total number of carrots is 12 + 16 = 28.

Next, I know that Faye picked 23 carrots. To find out how many carrots her mother picked, I subtract the number of carrots Faye picked from the total number of carrots. So, 28 total carrots minus 23 carrots picked by Faye equals 5 carrots picked by her mother.

Therefore, Faye's mother picked 5 carrots.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many carrots Faye's mother picked.

1. **Total Carrots Picked:**
   
   - **Good Carrots:** 12
   - **Bad Carrots:** 16
   
   \[
   \text{Total Carrots} = \text{Good Carrots} + \text{Bad Carrots} = 12 + 16 = 28
   \]

2. **Carrots Picked by Faye:**
   
   \[
   \text{Carrots Picked by Faye} = 23
   \]

3. **Carrots Picked by Faye's Mother:**
   
   To find out how many carrots Faye's mother picked, subtract the number of carrots Faye picked from the total number of carrots.
   
   \[
   \text{Carrots Picked by Mother} = \text{Total Carrots} - \text{Carrots Picked by Faye} = 28 - 23 = 5
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5}

First, determine the number of members remaining in the group after the removal:
150 members - 20 members = 130 members.

Next, calculate the total number of messages sent by the remaining members in one day:
130 members × 50 messages/member/day = 6,500 messages/day.

Finally, find the total number of messages sent in one week:
6,500 messages/day × 7 days = 45,500 messages.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of remaining members:**
   
   Initially, there were 150 members in the group. After removing 20 members:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ members}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of messages sent by the remaining members in one day:**
   
   Each member sends 50 messages per day. Therefore, the total number of messages sent by 130 members in one day is:
   \[
   130 \times 50 = 6,\!500 \text{ messages/day}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of messages sent in one week:**
   
   There are 7 days in a week. Thus, the total number of messages sent in a week is:
   \[
   6,\!500 \times 7 = 45,\!500 \text{ messages}

First, I need to find the original number based on the given condition that one more than its reciprocal equals 9/4.

I'll start by letting the original number be x.

According to the problem, the equation can be written as:
1 + (1/x) = 9/4

To isolate the reciprocal of x, I'll subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
1/x = 9/4 - 1

Simplifying the right side:
1/x = 9/4 - 4/4 = 5/4

Now, to find x, I'll take the reciprocal of both sides:
x = 4/5

Therefore, the original number is 4/5.
&lt;/think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
One more than the reciprocal of a certain number is \(\frac{9}{4}\). What is this original number expressed as a common fraction?

**Solution:**

1. **Let the original number be \(x\).**

2. **Set up the equation based on the given condition:**
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

3. **Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the reciprocal of \(x\):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} = \frac{9}{4} - 1
   \]

4. **Simplify the right side:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{4}{4} = \frac{5}{4}
   \]

5. **Take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}
\]</span></div></div>

First, I need to determine the total amount of sand received by Cities B, C, and D.

City B received 26 tons, City C received 24.5 tons, and City D received 28 tons. Adding these together:
26 + 24.5 + 28 = 78.5 tons.

The total sand donated to all four cities is 95 tons. To find out how much City A received, I subtract the total received by Cities B, C, and D from the overall total:
95 - 78.5 = 16.5 tons.

Therefore, City A received 16.5 tons of sand.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

We need to determine how many tons of sand City A received. Let's break down the information provided:

- **City B:** 26 tons
- **City C:** 24.5 tons
- **City D:** 28 tons
- **Total sand donated to all four cities:** 95 tons

To find the amount received by City A, we'll subtract the amounts received by Cities B, C, and D from the total sand donated.

\[
\text{City A} = \text{Total} - (\text{City B} + \text{City C} + \text{City D})
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{City A} = 95 - (26 + 24.5 + 28) = 95 - 78.5 = 16.5 \text{ tons}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{16.5}

   \]

2. **Additional Marbles Given by Fred:**
   
   Fred gives Sara:
   \[
   2,\!337.8 \text{ black marbles}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Marbles:**
   
   To find the total number of black marbles Sara has now, add the initial number of marbles to the additional marbles:
   \[
   4,\!892.5 + 2,\!337.8 = 7,\!230.3

To determine how many sets of exactly four consecutive positive integers have a sum of 34, we can use the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

Let the four consecutive integers be \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 \). The sum of these integers is given by:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 4n + 6
\]
We set this equal to 34:
\[
4n + 6 = 34
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
4n = 28 \implies n = 7
\]
Thus, the four consecutive integers are 7, 8, 9, and 10. 

Since there is only one such set, the answer is 1.

Let's denote the total length of the trail by \( L \) kilometers.

Jitka has hiked 60% of the trail, so the remaining 40% of the trail is left. This remaining distance is given as 8 km. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.40 \times L = 8
\]

To find the total length \( L \), we solve for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{8}{0.40} = \frac{8}{0.4} = \frac{8 \times 10}{4} = \frac{80}{4} = 20
\]

Thus, the total length of the trail is 20 kilometers.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's denote the total length of the trail by \( L \) kilometers.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Jitka has hiked **60%** of the trail.
   - The remaining **40%** of the trail is **8 km**.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   \[
   40\% \times L = 8 \text{ km}
   \]
   \[
   0.40 \times L = 8
   \]

3. **Solving for \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \frac{8}{0.40} = \frac{8}{0.4} = \frac{8 \times 10}{4} = \frac{80}{4} = 20

1. Let's denote the total length of the trail by \( L \) kilometers.
2. According to the problem, Jitka has hiked \( 60\% \) of the trail, which means the remaining \( 40\% \) of the trail is left.
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]
3. We are given that \( 40\% \) of the trail corresponds to \( 8 \) kilometers. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[

First, I need to determine how much Rachel earned from tips in one hour. She served 20 people, and each person left a $1.25 tip.

Next, I'll calculate the total tips by multiplying the number of people by the tip amount:
20 people * $1.25/person = $25

Rachel's total earnings for the hour were $37. To find out how much she earned without tips, I'll subtract the total tips from her total earnings:
$37 total earnings - $25 tips = $12

Therefore, Rachel makes $12 per hour without tips.
&lt;/think>

To determine how much Rachel makes per hour without tips, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Tips:**
   
   Rachel received a $1.25 tip from each of the 20 people she served.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Tips} = 20 \text{ people} \times \$1.25/\text{person} = \$25
   \]

2. **Determine Earnings Without Tips:**
   
   Rachel's total earnings for the hour were $37, which includes both her base pay and the tips.
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings Without Tips} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Tips} = \$37 - \$25 = \$12

First, I need to determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence. I can find this by dividing the second term by the first term.

Next, I'll use the common ratio to find the sixth term of the sequence. The formula for the \( k^{\text{th}} \) term of a geometric sequence is \( a_k = a \cdot r^{k-1} \), where \( a \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( k \) is the term number.

Finally, I'll substitute the known values into the formula to calculate the sixth term.
&lt;/think>

To determine the sixth term of the geometric sequence with the first term \( a = 3 \) and the second term \( 6 \), follow these steps:

1. **Find the Common Ratio (\( r \))**:
   
   The common ratio \( r \) in a geometric sequence is found by dividing the second term by the first term:
   \[
   r = \frac{\text{Second Term}}{\text{First Term}} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

2. **Use the General Formula for the \( k^{\text{th}} \) Term**:
   
   The \( k^{\text{th}} \) term of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   a_k = a \cdot r^{k-1}
   \]
   where:
   - \( a \) is the first term,
   - \( r \) is the common ratio,
   - \( k \) is the term number.

3. **Calculate the Sixth Term (\( a_6 \))**:
   
   Substitute the known values into the formula:
   \[
   a_6 = 3 \cdot 2^{6-1} = 3 \cdot 2^5 = 3 \cdot 32 = 96
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{96}

First, Melanie starts with 7 dimes.

Her mother gives her an additional 4 dimes, bringing the total to 7 + 4 = 11 dimes.

Melanie now has a total of 19 dimes.

To find out how many dimes her dad gave her, subtract the dimes she had after her mother's contribution from the total dimes she has now: 19 - 11 = 8 dimes.

Therefore, Melanie's dad gave her 8 dimes.
&lt;/think>

Let's determine how many dimes Melanie's dad gave her step by step.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Melanie starts with **7 dimes**.

2. **Dimes from Mother:**
   - Her mother gives her **4 dimes**.
   - **Total dimes after receiving from mother:**

3. **Total Dimes Now:**
   - Melanie now has a total of **19 dimes**.

4. **Dimes from Dad:**
   - To find out how many dimes her dad gave her, subtract the dimes she had after her mother gave her some from the total dimes she has now:
     \[
     19 \text{ (total)} - 11 \text{ (after mother)} = 8 \text{ dimes}

First, determine the total weight of the jelly beans after Alex ate 6 ounces. Since he divided the remaining jelly beans into 3 piles of 10 ounces each, the total remaining weight is 3 multiplied by 10 ounces, which equals 30 ounces.

Next, add the 6 ounces that Alex ate to the remaining 30 ounces to find the initial weight of the jelly beans. This gives a total of 36 ounces.

Therefore, Alex initially had 36 ounces of jelly beans.
&lt;/think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine the initial amount of jelly beans Alex had.

1. **After Eating 6 Ounces:**
   
   Alex ate 6 ounces of jelly beans. Let the initial amount of jelly beans be \( x \) ounces. Therefore, the remaining jelly beans after eating are:
   \[
   x - 6 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Dividing into 3 Equal Piles:**
   
   Alex divided the remaining jelly beans into 3 equal piles, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight of the remaining jelly beans is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Finding the Initial Amount:**
   
   The remaining jelly beans after eating are equal to 30 ounces. Therefore:
   \[
   x - 6 = 30
   \]
   
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 30 + 6 = 36 \text{ ounces}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{36}

4S - 12 = 28
4S = 40
S = 10

So, Lucas has 10 students in total. Last Monday, when all students were present, he made 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each student. Therefore, the total number of pieces he made last Monday is 4 × 10 = 40.
&lt;/think>

Let's determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Lucas made for his class last Monday.

**Step 1: Find the Total Number of Students**

Let \( S \) represent the total number of students Lucas has.

This upcoming Monday, 3 students will not be attending, so Lucas will be making chocolate candy for \( S - 3 \) students.

He will make a total of 28 pieces of chocolate candy for these students, with each student receiving 4 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
4 \times (S - 3) = 28
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( S \)**

\[
4S - 12 = 28
\]

\[
4S = 28 + 12
\]

\[
4S = 40
\]

\[
S = \frac{40}{4} = 10
\]

So, Lucas has a total of **10 students**.

**Step 3: Calculate Last Monday's Chocolate Candy**

Last Monday, all 10 students were present. Since Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each student, the total number of pieces he made is:

\[
4 \times 10 = 40
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{40}
\]</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Let's denote the number of students Lucas has as S. Since 3 students will not be coming this upcoming Monday, he will be making chocolate candy for S - 3 students. We know that he will make 28 pieces of chocolate candy for S - 3 students, and he makes 4 pieces per student. So we can write the equation:

4 * (S - 3) = 28

Now we can solve for S:

4S - 12 = 28
4S = 28 + 12
4S = 40
S = 40 / 4
S = 10

So Lucas has 10 students in total. Last Monday, when all of his students were present, he made 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of them. Therefore, the total number of pieces he made last Monday is:

4 pieces/student * 10 students = 40 pieces

Lucas made $\boxed{40}$  pieces of chocolate candy for his class last Monday.</span></div></div>
