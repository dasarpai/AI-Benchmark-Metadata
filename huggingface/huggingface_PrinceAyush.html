A panic attack or anxiety attack can both cause physical and emotional symptoms, including - apprehension and worry - distress - fear of dying or losing control - a sense of detachment from the world (derealization) or oneself (depersonalization) - heart palpitations or an accelerated heart rate - chest pain - shortness of breath - tightness in the throat or feeling like youre choking - dry mouth - sweating - chills or hot flashes - trembling or shaking - numbness or tingling (paresthesia) - nausea, abdominal pain, or upset stomach - headache - feeling faint or dizzy&quot;},&quot;questionTitle&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are symptoms of panic attack vs. anxiety attack?&quot;},&quot;questionText&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;answerText&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include Anxiety disorders People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. Mood disorders These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness. Psychotic disorders Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder. Eating disorders Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food. Personality disorders People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.&quot;},&quot;questionTitle&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are the types of Mental Illness?&quot;},&quot;questionText&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;answerText&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mental illness is a group of biological brain disorders that affect a persons thinking, mood, emotions, sense of reality, ability to relate and daily functioning.

Treatment incudes 3 main facets medication, therapy &amp; support. There are several types of medication being produced to combat mental-illness, the aim of which is to reduce social symptoms and help bring about daily functioning. Therapy with a clinically trained psychologist helps understand your disease better and equips you with the tools you need to deal with the disease.

Talking to a professional helps you understand your mechanisms and how to deal better with them. 2. Exercise Be it the gym or just a run, doing a cardio activity leads to better stress levels 3.

Theyre accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.</span></div></div>

You can experience both an anxiety and a panic attack at the same time. For instance, you might experience anxiety while worrying about a potentially stressful situation, like an important presentation at work. When the situation arrives, anxiety may culminate in a panic attack. A panic attack or anxiety attack can both cause physical and emotional symptoms, including - apprehension and worry - distress - fear of dying or losing control - a sense of detachment from the world (derealization) or oneself (depersonalization) - heart palpitations or an accelerated heart rate - chest pain - shortness of breath - tightness in the throat or feeling like youre choking - dry mouth - sweating - chills or hot flashes - trembling or shaking - numbness or tingling (paresthesia) - nausea, abdominal pain, or upset stomach - headache - feeling faint or dizzy</span></div></div>

The more common types include Anxiety disorders People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. Mood disorders These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness. Psychotic disorders Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder. Eating disorders Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food. Personality disorders People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.</span></div></div>

Talk it out Find a mental health professional and start talking about your day to day life. Talking it out helps reduce the mental worry one carries with them. Talking to a professional helps you understand your mechanisms and how to deal better with them. 2. Exercise Be it the gym or just a run, doing a cardio activity leads to better stress levels 3.

It is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively.
