you up to speed with python as quickly as possible so you can build programs that work--gamesdata visualizationsand web applications--while developing foundation in programming that will serve you well for the rest of your life python crash course is written for people of any age who have never programmed in python before or have never programmed at all if you want to learn the basics of programming quickly so you can focus on interesting projectsand you like to test your understanding of new concepts by solving meaningful problemsthis book is for you python crash course is also perfect for middle school and high school teachers who want to offer their students project-based introduction to programming what can you expect to learnthe purpose of this book is to make you good programmer in general and good python programmer in particular you'll learn efficiently and adopt good habits as provide you with solid foundation in general programming concepts after working your way through python crash courseyou should be ready to move on to more advanced python techniquesand your next programming language will be even easier to grasp in the first part of this book you'll learn basic programming concepts you need to know to write python programs these concepts are the same as those you' learn when starting out in almost any programming language you'll learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in lists and dictionaries within your programs you'll learn to build collections of data and work through those collections in efficient ways you'll learn to use while and if loops to test for certain conditions so you can run specific sections of code while those conditions are true and run other sections when they're not-- technique that greatly helps to automate processes you'll learn to accept input from users to make your programs inter active and to keep your programs running as long as the user is active you'll explore how to write functions to make parts of your program reusableso you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain xxx

through each of these basic conceptsyou'll write few short programs that solve some well-defined problems finallyyou'll take your first step toward intermediate programming by learning how to write tests for your code so you can develop your programs further without worrying about introducing bugs all the information in part will prepare you for taking on largermore complex projects in part ii you'll apply what you learned in part to three projects you can do any or all of these projects in whichever order works best for you in the first project - you'll create space invaders-style shooting game called alien invasionwhich consists of levels of increasing difficulty after you've completed this projectyou should be well on your way to being able to develop your own games the second project - introduces you to data visualization data scientists aim to make sense of the vast amount of information available to them through variety of visualization techniques you'll work with data sets that you generate through codedata sets downloaded from online sourcesand data sets your programs download automatically after you've completed this projectyou'll be able to write programs that sift through large data sets and make visual representations of that stored information in the third project - you'll build small web application called learning log this project allows you to keep journal of ideas and concepts you've learned about specific topic you'll be able to keep separate logs for different topics and allow others to create an account and start their own journals you'll also learn how to deploy your project so anyone can access it online from anywhere why pythonevery year consider whether to continue using python or whether to move on to different language--perhaps one that' newer to the programming world but continue to focus on python for many reasons python is an incredibly efficient languageyour programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require python' syntax will also help you write \&quot;cleancode your code will be easy to readeasy to debugand easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages people use python for

sure to keep the following variable rules in mindvariable names can contain only lettersnumbersand underscores they can start with letter or an underscorebut not with number for instanceyou can call variable message_ but not _message spaces are not allowed in variable namesbut underscores can be used to separate words in variable names for examplegreeting_message worksbut greeting message will cause errors avoid using python keywords and function names as variable namesthat isdo not use words that python has reserved for particular programmatic purposesuch as the word print (see \&quot;python keywords and built-in functionson page variable names should be short but descriptive for examplename is better than nstudent_name is better than s_nand name_length is better than length_of_persons_name be careful when using the lowercase letter and the uppercase letter because they could be confused with the numbers and it can take some practice to learn how to create good variable namesespecially as your programs become more interesting and complicated as you write more programs and start to read through other people' codeyou'll get better at coming up with meaningful names note the python variables you're using at this point should be lowercase you won' get errors if you use uppercase lettersbut it' good idea to avoid using them for now avoiding name errors when

after the variable in the print(statement method is an action that python can perform on piece of data the dot after name in name title(tells python to make the title(method act on the variable name every method is followed by set of parenthesesbecause methods often need additional information to do their work that information is provided inside the parentheses the title(function doesn' need any additional informationso its parentheses are empty title(displays each word in titlecasewhere each word begins with capital letter this is useful because you'll often want to think of name as piece of information for exampleyou might want your program to recognize the input values adaadaand ada as the same nameand display all of them as ada several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well for exampleyou can change string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters like thisname \&quot;ada lovelaceprint(name upper()print(name lower()this will display the followingada lovelace ada lovelace the lower(method is particularly useful for storing data many times you won' want to trust the capitalization that your users provideso you'll convert strings to lowercase before

sessionpython simply returns the result of the operation python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents * * * python supports the order of operations tooso you can use multiple operations in one expression you can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify for example * ( the spacing in these examples has no effect on how python evaluates the expressionsit simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that have priority when you're reading through the code floats python calls any

appropriately no matter where the decimal point appears for the most partyou can use decimals without worrying about how they behave simply enter the numbers you want to useand python will most likely do what you expect but be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer this happens in all languages and is of little concern python tries to find way to represent the result as precisely as possiblewhich is sometimes difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally just ignore the extra decimal places for nowyou'll learn ways to deal with the extra places when you need to in the projects in part ii avoiding type errors with the str(function oftenyou'll want to use variable' value within message for examplesay you want to wish

or the characters and when you use integers within strings like thisyou need to specify explicitly that you want python to use the integer as string of characters you can do this by wrapping the variable in the str(functionwhich tells python to represent non-string values as stringsage message \&quot;happy str(age\&quot;rd birthday!print(messagepython now knows that you want to convert the numerical value to string and display the characters and as part of the birthday message now you get the message you were expectingwithout any errorshappy rd birthdayworking with numbers in python is straightforward most of the time if you're getting unexpected resultscheck whether python is interpreting your numbers the way you want it toeither as numerical value or as string value integers in python python returns slightly different result when you divide two integerspython instead of python returns division of integers in python results in an integer with the remainder truncated note that the result is not rounded integerthe remainder is simply omitted to avoid this behavior in python make sure that at least one of the numbers is float by doing sothe result will be float as well this

loopso the program simply ends when you're using loops for the first timekeep in mind that the set of steps is repeated once for each item in the listno matter how many items are in the list if you have million items in your listpython repeats these steps million times--and usually very quickly also keep in mind when writing your own for loops that you can choose any name you want for the temporary variable that holds each value in the list howeverit' helpful to choose meaningful name that represents single item from the list for examplehere' good way to start for loop for list of catsa list of dogsand general list of itemsfor cat in catsfor dog in dogsfor item in list_of_itemsthese naming conventions can help you follow the action being done on each item within for loop using singular and plural names can help you identify whether section of code is working with single element from the list or the entire list doing more work within for loop you can do just about anything with each item in for loop let' build on the previous example by printing message to each magiciantelling them that they performed great trickmagicians ['alice''david''carolina'for magician in magiciansu print(magician title(\&quot;that was great trick!\&quot;the only difference in this code is at where we compose message to each magicianstarting with that magician' name the first time

good way to summarize an operation that was performed on an entire data set for exampleyou might use for loop to initialize game by running through list of characters and displaying each character on the screen you might then write an unindented block after this loop that displays play now button after all the characters have been drawn to the screen avoiding indentation errors python uses indentation to determine when one line of code is connected to the line above it in the previous examplesthe lines that printed messages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they were indented python' use of indentation makes code very easy to read basicallyit uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with clear visual structure in longer python programsyou'll notice blocks of code indented at few different levels these indentation levels help you gain general sense of the overall program' organization as you begin to write code that relies on proper indentationyou'll need to watch for few common indentation errors for examplepeople sometimes indent blocks of code that don' need to be indented or forget to indent blocks that need to be indented seeing examples of these errors now will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do appear in your own programs let' examine some of the more common indentation errors

that you're writing longer programsideas about how to style your code are worthwhile to know take the time to make your code as easy as possible to read writing easy-to-read code helps you keep track of what your programs are doing and helps others understand your code as well python programmers have agreed on number of styling conventions to ensure that everyone' code is structured in roughly the same way once you've learned to write clean python codeyou should be able to understand the overall structure of anyone else' python codeas long as they follow the same guidelines if you're hoping to become professional programmer at some pointyou should begin following these guidelines as soon as possible to develop good habits the style guide when someone wants to make change to the python languagethey write python enhancement proposal (pepone of the oldest peps is pep which instructs python programmers on how to style their code pep is fairly lengthybut much of it relates to more complex coding structures than what you've seen so far the python style guide was written with the understanding that code is read more often than it is written you'll write your code once and then start reading it as you begin debugging when you add features to programyou'll spend more time reading your code when you share your code with other programmersthey'll read your code as well given the choice between writing code that' easier to write or code that' easier to readpython programmers will almost always encourage you to write code that' easier to read the following guidelines will help you write clear code from the start indentation pep recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level using four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of indentation on each line in word processing documentpeople often use tabs rather than spaces to indent this works well for word processing documentsbut the python interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces every text editor provides setting that lets you use the tab key but then converts each tab to set number of spaces you should definitely use your tab keybut also make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into your document mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very difficult to diagnose if you think you have mix of tabs and spacesyou can convert all tabs in file to spaces in most editors&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:96,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;96&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;many python programmers recommend that each line should be less than characters historicallythis guideline developed because most computers could fit only characters on single line in terminal window currentlypeople can fit much longer lines on their screensbut other reasons exist to adhere to the -character standard line length professional programmers often have several files open on the same screenand using the standard line length allows them to see entire lines in two or three files that are open side by side onscreen pep also recommends that you limit all of your comments to characters per linebecause some of the tools that generate automatic documentation for larger projects add formatting characters at the beginning of each commented line the pep guidelines for line length are not set in stoneand some teams prefer -character limit don' worry too much about line length in your code as you're learningbut be aware that people who are working collaboratively almost always follow the pep guidelines most editors allow you to set up visual cueusually vertical line on your screenthat shows you where these limits are note appendix shows you how to configure your text editor so it always inserts four spaces each time you press the tab key and shows vertical guideline to help you follow the -character limit blank lines to group parts of your program visuallyuse blank lines you should use blank lines to organize your filesbut don' do so excessively by following the examples provided in this bookyou should strike the right balance for exampleif you have five lines of code that build listand then another three lines that do something with that listit' appropriate to place blank line between the two sections howeveryou should not place three or four blank lines between the two sections blank lines won' affect how your code runsbut they will affect the readability of your code the python interpreter uses horizontal indentation to interpret the meaning of your codebut it disregards vertical spacing other style guidelines pep has many additional styling recommendationsbut most of the guidelines refer to more complex programs than what you're writing at this point as

this and modify each one to comply with pep use four spaces for each indentation level set your text editor to insert four spaces every time you press tabif you haven' already done so (see appendix

if conditional test evaluates to truepython executes the code following the if statement if the test evaluates to falsepython ignores the code following the if statement checking for equality most conditional tests compare the current value of variable to specific value of interest the simplest conditional test checks whether the value of variable is equal to the value of interestu car 'bmwv
