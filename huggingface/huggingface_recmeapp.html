Want to learn how to become more successful and enjoy the power of inner-monologue?\n\nIMPROVING SELF LOVE AND SELF ESTEEM IS SIMPLE\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.\n\nSCIENCE BACKED\nThe app is shown to improve supportive thinking and reduce maladaptive beliefs in 7 published academic papers.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours.\n\nHOW DO I FEEL SELF LOVE\nThe foundations of healthy self worth and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \&quot;everything in my life needs to be prefect\&quot;, I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.\n\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of negative thoughts\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts\n3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and supportive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking\n5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\nTo feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\n\nBEGIN YOUR JOURNEY TO SELF LOVE\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of 'thoughts' to complete the level.\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GGTUDE APPS\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\n\nOTHER APPS BY GG\nGG Self Care &amp; Mood Tracker\nGG OCD Anxiety &amp; Depression\nGGBI: Body Image Distress &amp; Preoccupation&quot;},&quot;content_rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Everyone&quot;},&quot;num_reviews&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;625&quot;},&quot;price&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Install&quot;},&quot;avg_rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;app_package&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;com.booster.gfx&quot;},&quot;app_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Game Booster : Launcher - GFX&quot;},&quot;developer_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TOLAN&quot;},&quot;app_category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Libraries &amp; Demo&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Game Booster will unlock your device's maximum power and bring your game play experience to the next level!\n\nAutomatically boost CPU, RAM and re-index your disk for gaming and the maximum performance.

They are capable to create an endless range of fascinating organic shapes. You may already know classical fern- or flower-like shapes, but there are virtually no limits. You can create trees, gems, demons, oceans, faces, pottery, ... you will often be surprised by your own creations!\nWith this app you will be able to create unique flame fractals by playing with the MutaG module. You can start with modifying one of 60 the stunning flame fractals which are included, and then later continue to modify your own creations. Share your renderings with your friends and amaze your girlfriend with an unique valentine fractal!\nWith the paid app you can export the \&quot;formulas\&quot; of your creations to be able to\n\nrender wallpapers, post-edit them using the full-fledged editor or even render artworks suited for print in extreme high quality. All you will need, is a decent personal computer and the full JWildfire application which is completely free and runs on any major platforms.\n\nThere are no hidden costs at all. The whole full application is completely free and you can use it without this app, of course.\nThe only cost ist just to unlock to feature of exporting your flames from this app, the PNG export is also included in the free app.\n\nFeatures:\n- full-fledged JWildfire-compatible flame renderer, even if not all features may be exposed, this renderer is even able to render flames with Pseudo3D-shading enabled, but this may take some time ;-)\n- Flame library with 60 stunning example flames ready to be play with (some of them are even unfinished material yet). You can extend the flame library with your own work.\n- MutaGen3x3 module to create endless mutations of flame fractals using the powerful mutation generators known from the JWildfire software\n- MutaGen5x5 module to create even more complex mutations\n- Interactive renderer with the ability to export rendered images as PNG\n- Flame gallery with some stunning work made by myself to show what is possible with flame fractals\n- Ability to export flames (only in the purchased app) via email to be able to render your flames in any quality you desire later (using the full and free JWildfire application for personal computers).\n\nUpgrading: Be careful: If you upgrade any version, you may loose your personal flames. So please export (eventually as image) all your stuff which matters, before doing any update.&quot;},&quot;content_rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Everyone&quot;},&quot;num_reviews&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;108&quot;},&quot;price&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;$2.50 Buy&quot;},&quot;avg_rating&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4.3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4.3&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;app_package&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;com.papajohns.android&quot;},&quot;app_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Papa Johns Pizza &amp; Delivery&quot;},&quot;developer_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Papa John's Pizza&quot;},&quot;app_category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Food &amp; Drink&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Choose No Contact pizza delivery and safe pickup options!

Descend into the atmosphere of survival right now or start Last Day on Earth once you're done with reading this description, in which I'm going to tell you about some key features.\n\n■ Create your character and look around: near your shelter, there are a lot of locations with different danger levels. From the resources collected here you can craft everything necessary for survival: from a house and clothes to weapons and an all-terrain vehicle.\n\n■ As your level grows, hundreds of useful recipes and blueprints will become available to you. First off, build and enhance the walls of your house, learn new skills, modify weapons, and discover all the joys of the gaming process.\n\n■ Pets are an islet of love and friendship in the world of the zombie apocalypse. Joyful huskies and smart shepherd dogs will be happy to accompany you in raids, and while you're about it, help you carry out loot from hard-to-reach places.\n\n■ Assemble a fast Chopper, an ATV, or a motorboat and get access to remote locations on the map. You don't get the rarest resources for complex blueprints and unique quests for nothing. If there's a mechanic sleeping inside of you, it's just the time to wake him up!\n\n■ If you like cooperative play, visit the city in the Crater. There you'll meet loyal companions and find out what you're worth in PvP. Join a clan, play with other players, feel the unity of a real pack!\n\n■ Survivor (if you have read this far, I can call you that), an arsenal of cold weapons and firearms that would make even a seasoned hardcore player envy is at your service. Here are bats, miniguns, M16, good-old AK-47, Mortar, C4, and too much more to list, better see it for yourself.\n\n■ Forests, Police Station, Spooky Farm, Port, and Bunkers packed with zombies, raiders, and other random characters. Always be ready to use force or flee. Anything goes, when it comes to survival!\n\nNow you are a survivor. No matter who you are, where you come from, and what you used to be before.

Message:      An error occurred while generating the dataset

All the data files must have the same columns, but at some point there are 7 new columns ({'uid', 'review', 'rating', 'formated_date', 'date', 'votes', 'unix_timestamp'}) and 7 missing columns ({'price', 'num_reviews', 'app_name', 'content_rating', 'avg_rating', 'developer_name', 'description'}).

This happened while the csv dataset builder was generating data using

Please either edit the data files to have matching columns, or separate them into different configurations (see docs at https://hf.co/docs/hub/datasets-manual-configuration#multiple-configurations)

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can everyone access the CreditWise app?
A: Yes. You just have to be 18 or older.

Q: Does using CreditWise hurt my credit score?
A: No. You can utilize all of CreditWise’s free tools and features without hurting your score.

IMPROVING SELF LOVE AND SELF ESTEEM IS SIMPLE
Throw away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.

SCIENCE BACKED
The app is shown to improve supportive thinking and reduce maladaptive beliefs in 7 published academic papers.
According to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours.

HOW DO I FEEL SELF LOVE
The foundations of healthy self worth and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that "everything in my life needs to be prefect", I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.

BELIEFS AND SELF TALK
Beliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.

HOW THE APP WORKS
The app is designed to:
1. Increase your awareness of negative thoughts
2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts
3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and supportive thoughts
4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking
5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost

IS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?
Our app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:
1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.
2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.
3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more.

GET TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS
The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.
The more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.

HOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?
To feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.

BEGIN YOUR JOURNEY TO SELF LOVE
The app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of 'thoughts' to complete the level.
To further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.

The topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.

You can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.

Training using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.

Features:
• Customize your search using filters like price, location, area, number of beds and more
• Sort your results by area, price, date posted and popularity for a seamless experience
• Scroll through all the images available with a property at your leisure
• Find all the necessary information about a property on one simple screen
• Share a property instantly on your social networking pages
• Send all the details of a property as a message to anyone you want

Once you’ve tried the app, we’d love to hear what you thought of it. Innovation is our middle name, and we love working off of user feedback, so please let us know how we can make the Bayut App even awesomer.

Voice Access provides many voice commands for:
- Basic navigation (e.g. "go back", "go home", "open Gmail")
- Controlling the current screen (e.g. "tap next", "scroll down")
- Text editing and dictation (e.g. "type hello", "replace coffee with tea")

You can also say "Help" any time to see a short list of commands.

Voice Access includes a tutorial which introduces the most common voice commands (starting Voice Access, tapping, scrolling, basic text editing, and getting help).

You can use the Google Assistant to start Voice Access by saying "Hey Google, Voice Access". To do this, you’ll need to enable "Hey Google" detection. You can also tap either the Voice Access notification or a blue Voice Access button and start talking.

To pause Voice Access temporarily, just say "stop listening". To disable Voice Access completely, go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Access and turn off the switch.

For additional support, see Voice Access help.

This app uses the AccessibilityService API to help users with motor impairments. It uses the API to collect information about the controls on the screen and activate them based on the user’s spoken instructions.</span></div></div>

Led by a mysterious man, you gain access to this special app and become a member of the Liberators, a secret organization that fights to protect the world from an opposing faction of Dx2s.

The enemy is known only as the Acolytes.

Driven by their own ideology, the Acolytes abuse their demon-summoning capabilities to wreak chaos, and are secretly eliminating people with high empathy quotients (EQ) who pose a threat to their goals.

It comes with both the fractal evolution module "MutaG" and the interactive renderer "IR", as known from the full JWildfire application, to your Android-capable device!
JWildfire is a very comprehensive software suite to both construct and render flame fractals (end even create movies of them).
In short, flame fractals are an extension to classical IFS (iterated function systems) and were invented by Scott Draves. They are capable to create an endless range of fascinating organic shapes. You may already know classical fern- or flower-like shapes, but there are virtually no limits. You can create trees, gems, demons, oceans, faces, pottery, ... you will often be surprised by your own creations!
With this app you will be able to create unique flame fractals by playing with the MutaG module. You can start with modifying one of 60 the stunning flame fractals which are included, and then later continue to modify your own creations. Share your renderings with your friends and amaze your girlfriend with an unique valentine fractal!
With the paid app you can export the "formulas" of your creations to be able to

render wallpapers, post-edit them using the full-fledged editor or even render artworks suited for print in extreme high quality. All you will need, is a decent personal computer and the full JWildfire application which is completely free and runs on any major platforms.

There are no hidden costs at all. The whole full application is completely free and you can use it without this app, of course.
The only cost ist just to unlock to feature of exporting your flames from this app, the PNG export is also included in the free app.

Features:
- full-fledged JWildfire-compatible flame renderer, even if not all features may be exposed, this renderer is even able to render flames with Pseudo3D-shading enabled, but this may take some time ;-)
- Flame library with 60 stunning example flames ready to be play with (some of them are even unfinished material yet). You can extend the flame library with your own work.
- MutaGen3x3 module to create endless mutations of flame fractals using the powerful mutation generators known from the JWildfire software
- MutaGen5x5 module to create even more complex mutations
- Interactive renderer with the ability to export rendered images as PNG
- Flame gallery with some stunning work made by myself to show what is possible with flame fractals
- Ability to export flames (only in the purchased app) via email to be able to render your flames in any quality you desire later (using the full and free JWildfire application for personal computers).

Upgrading: Be careful: If you upgrade any version, you may loose your personal flames. So please export (eventually as image) all your stuff which matters, before doing any update.</span></div></div>

Feel the horror and adrenaline rush from the process of real surviving in a harsh environment! Meet the world where zombie hordes' instinct to murder you is as strong as thirst or hunger. Descend into the atmosphere of survival right now or start Last Day on Earth once you're done with reading this description, in which I'm going to tell you about some key features.

■ Create your character and look around: near your shelter, there are a lot of locations with different danger levels. From the resources collected here you can craft everything necessary for survival: from a house and clothes to weapons and an all-terrain vehicle.

■ As your level grows, hundreds of useful recipes and blueprints will become available to you. First off, build and enhance the walls of your house, learn new skills, modify weapons, and discover all the joys of the gaming process.

■ Pets are an islet of love and friendship in the world of the zombie apocalypse. Joyful huskies and smart shepherd dogs will be happy to accompany you in raids, and while you're about it, help you carry out loot from hard-to-reach places.

■ Assemble a fast Chopper, an ATV, or a motorboat and get access to remote locations on the map. You don't get the rarest resources for complex blueprints and unique quests for nothing. If there's a mechanic sleeping inside of you, it's just the time to wake him up!

■ If you like cooperative play, visit the city in the Crater. There you'll meet loyal companions and find out what you're worth in PvP. Join a clan, play with other players, feel the unity of a real pack!

■ Survivor (if you have read this far, I can call you that), an arsenal of cold weapons and firearms that would make even a seasoned hardcore player envy is at your service. Here are bats, miniguns, M16, good-old AK-47, Mortar, C4, and too much more to list, better see it for yourself.

■ Forests, Police Station, Spooky Farm, Port, and Bunkers packed with zombies, raiders, and other random characters. Always be ready to use force or flee. Anything goes, when it comes to survival!

Now you are a survivor. No matter who you are, where you come from, and what you used to be before. Welcome to the cruel new world...</span></div></div>

Pure-tone audiometry determines the degree of hearing loss in relation to the sound frequency. The test consists in determining the quietest sound that you are able to hear, thus determining your hearing threshold. The digits-in-noise test evaluates speech intelligibility and consists of recognition of the digits in the noise.

The features of the Hearing Test app:
* pure-tone audiometry (using bundled headphones and predefined calibration coefficients from the database),
* the digits-in-noise test for speech intelligibility measurements,
* noise meter to measure background noise during the test,
* calibration of the device (in the case of lack of predefined calibration or for headphones other than bundled).

Additional features:
* high-frequency audiometry,
* classification of the hearing loss,
* comparison with age norms,
* printing of the tests results,
* adding notes,
* calibration adjustment (calibration coefficients may be adjusted on the basis of your results obtained using clinical audiometer),
* verification of calibration coefficients.

Pro version features:
* local database (offline access to tests results, without connecting to the server),
* synchronization (your tests results can be stored in a cloud; data are easy to recover, can be transferred between devices and accessed on different devices).</span></div></div>

The idea is simple: every day, we set a new subject for everyone to draw. You do your sketch or drawing, take a photo, and upload it for that day for everyone to see.

You can sketch, draw, paint, use digital art apps. Whatever you like that gets you into the habit of drawing every day.

Submit as many as you like, and see your progress over time.

And with the all-new Learn section, you will find great tutorials from our wonderful community of talented artists. Want to learn watercolours? Craving crafty ideas? Need to practise drawing people? Then the Learn section is perfect for you.

Lots of people are using Sketch a Day as a great way to start a positive habit. I have had many messages of support about the effect it has had on people's mental health, wellness and mindfulness. Sketching is a great habit to get into, even if like so many people, you think you "can't draw". It's a very peaceful, quiet and creative pastime, and receiving the help and support of others is a great way to feel good about yourself.

Sketch a Day is a wonderful, positive community with people from all over the world coming together to draw a common theme. If you need ideas for drawing, inspiration, encouragement or just want to look at amazing art, Sketch a Day is the right app for you.

If you've ever participated in Inktober, this app is like that - but forever - and you have a place to share your work and enjoy others.

If you want to learn, want to get back into drawing, or just want a quick practice or warm-up, then Sketch a Day could be perfect for you. For beginners, we have tips and tutorials each day. For the experts, you can post your images and show your skills to the world.


So...go sharpen your pencils!

Did you know?

• By drawing each day and getting likes, you can build your own private gallery of famous masterpieces.
• Parental controls make Sketch a Day a safer place. You can prevent 'adult material' from being seen by your children by setting a PIN on the parental controls.
• You can comment on people's sketches so you can ask how they did it, ask for tips, give them some kudos or just be silly!
• You can also add your Instagram account name so people can follow you on Instagram quickly and easily.
• When you've done a drawing, you can share it on Facebook straight from the app.

We have had some really creative drawings in our first few months. We've had pencils, watercolours, digital drawing, pen and ink, acrylics. We've had kids, adults, beginners, improvers and experts!

---

I would like to use this space to say thank you to all the people who have messaged me to tell me how Sketch a Day has made their lives better. Drawing every day really seems to have a huge positive effect on people's lives.</span></div></div>

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

You just got a new job at Papa's Donuteria in the whimsical town of Powder Point! The pay and benefits are nice, but you took the job for that coveted Line-Jump Pass for the amusement park right outside the shop. It's not all fun and games though: Now you also have to cook delicious donuts every day for all of the crazy customers in this carnival-like town.

You'll need to prepare donuts using a variety of doughs and shapes, then toss them in the fryer and cook both sides until they're just right. Finish the delicious donuts with tasty fillings, icing, and toppings before serving them to your hungry customers. First-time visitors may just order one donut to try, but repeat customers can't get enough and will start ordering more donuts when they visit! Powder Point also celebrates different holidays year-round, so get ready to unlock new festive ingredients as you play through the holidays!

-- GAME FEATURES --

NEW FEATURES - All of your favorite features from other versions of Papa's restaurants are now available in this "To Go" game, redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens!

You'll unlock new donut shapes, fillings, icing, drizzles, and toppings for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying new tasty flavors.

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS - Play as Tony or Scooter, or create your own custom character to work in the donut shop! You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers. Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - Some customers don't want to come all the way to the amusement park to get their donut fix! When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their donut order, and you'll hire a Driver to help take and deliver orders to their homes instead!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection. Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

DECORATE THE SHOP - Customize the Donuteria lobby with themed furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year! Mix and match your favorite styles, or add items that match the current holiday so customers won't mind waiting longer for their food.

Over 1000 Quiz Questions and 1000 Flashcards!

The EMT tutor is a comprehensive training tool for the EMT Basic. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or starting class this app will position you for success in the real world. If you are a student going through class you will benefit from this app. Simultaneously, so will a seasoned veteran in the EMS field that is trying to stay current on recent developments.

The material has been prepared and verified with most recent text books and includes the additional information now presented in most classes that includes Pathophysiology, Life Span Development, and expanded Anatomy and Physiology sections. Over 1000 Possible quiz questions and flashcards available. Prepare for class or review for the NREMT Exam with the EMTutor.

5 major components differentiate us from our competitors:

1. A Bookmarking feature that allows the user to save difficult questions, flashcards, or scenarios for later study. This allows the user to tailor the experience to their needs.

2. Explanations so that the user learns from every question and flashcard.

3. Over 1000 Quiz Questions and 1000 Flashcards prepared by EMS instructors that are involved in both EMS education, and running calls in the streets. This enables the material to be relevant for students and to prepare you for the real world as an EMT-B.

4. A Scenario based section has been developed to aid in taking text book material from page to street. Over 50 scenarios are given here, with more to come, that a user can go through on their own or with a field instructor to stimulate the thinking processes that occur on a 911 call.

5. Material that has been developed by EMS educators that are current on latest NREMT developments. Our material has been developed for the iPhone user and cannot be found on a website somewhere for free. Because of this we believe that our material is for learning and teaching on the iPhone not for assessing how smart the user is. Other material is built to assess, ours is built to teach.

Please feel free to Email any questions or concerns to: code3apps@yahoo.com, we are always willing to help in any way. Good luck on your EMT Exam and stay safe out there.</span></div></div>
