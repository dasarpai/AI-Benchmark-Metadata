Dusting Your Hair\n1-1. Divide your hair into portions.\nGather your hair into four large equal portions. Twist each portion and clip them to your head. Each portion should be out of your face and held tightly against your head. If your hair is thick and curly, you can make a lot of two-strand twists or braids. Pin these to your scalp.\nIt can be difficult to dust your own hair if it's very short. You may want to ask a friend to help you dust your hair if it's too short to do on your own.\n1-2. Unclip and divide one section of hair.\nUnclip one portion of hair near your eyes. Divide the hair within this portion into 3 or 4 rows of hair. If you have straight hair, feed one row of hair between your index and middle fingers. Pull your fingers down so that only the ends of the row of hair are exposed.\nIf you have curly hair, twist one of the rows so it's neat. You'll probably see some loose ends poking out from the section. These will be hairs that you dust.\n1-3. Dust just the ends of your hair.\nTake hair cutting shears and look at the end of each row or twist of hair. If you find a split end or knot, trim less than 1/4 of an inch from the end. You should only cut the split end to preserve the length of your hair.\nAvoid using kitchen or craft scissors which can be blunt and will damage your hair. Professional hair scissors will create sharp clean cuts that can keep your hair healthy.\n1-4. Dust all around your head.\nOnce you've dusted the front portion of your hair, continue dusting the remaining portions around your head. If you're having trouble seeing the split ends, hold a row of hair up to the light. This can make it easier to spot any split ends or knots.\nWhen you're done dusting, you should see very fine hairs over the floor. If you've dusted correctly, you shouldn't see large locks of hair or curls on the floor.\n2. Determining Your Hair Needs\n2-1. Get a trim if you have healthy hair.\nThink about how often your hair gets knots or split ends. If your hair is pretty healthy and just looks a little straggly at the ends, you might need an actual trim. A full trim should remove the bottom 1/2 to inch of hair. You should get a trim every 3 or 4 months.\nWhile getting a trim can remove a lot of unhealthy hair (split ends and knots), it will also remove the most length. Getting a trim can make it difficult to grow your hair out quickly.\n2-2. Trim just the split ends and knots.\nIf you only want to trim the split ends so you keep as much length as possible, use the search and destroy method. To do this, your hair must be long enough to pull in front of your eyes. This way you can look at each strand of hair for split ends and knots. When you find them, cut about 1/4 of an inch above the knot, split end or fray to completely remove the damage.\nThis method takes a lot of time since you have to go through every strand of hair. If you find a lot of split ends or knots within a month, you may actually want to get a full trim.\n2-3. Consider dusting if you have curly hair.\nIf you have curly or wavy hair, you've probably had the experience of asking for a trim only to end up with an actual hair cut. This is because curly hair recoils more if it's cut or trimmed when it's wet. Instead, cut, dust, or trim your hair when it's dry so you can see exactly how much length you're removing.\nYou probably only need a full trim every 3 or 4 months, if you have curly hair. In the meantime, dust your hair whenever you notice split ends, about every 6 to 8 weeks.\nWarnings\nAlways use caution when using sharp scissors.\n&quot;},&quot;元数据&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;create_time\&quot;: \&quot;20230517 10:42:08\&quot;,\n  \&quot;回答明细\&quot;: \&quot;{\\\&quot;回答\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;1.

Unfortunately, you need to keep the ends of your hair healthy by removing split ends. Instead of trimming away the split ends and removing length from your hair, try dusting your hair at home. Dusting is simply a way to cut away split ends while leaving the length. Dusting is really helpful for curly-haired people since it doesn't remove too much length from the hair.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;结构\\\&quot;: {\\\&quot;方法\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Dusting Your Hair\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Divide your hair into portions.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Gather your hair into four large equal portions.

How-to vs. How to\n1-1. Hyphenate “how-to” when talking about a set of instructions.\nHow-to can be used either as a noun (a person/place/thing/idea) or an adjective (a word used to modify/describe a noun). In both cases, “how-to” with a hyphen refers to a set of instructions or a step-by-step tutorial about completing a task. When used as an adjective, “how-to” is often paired with words like “book,” “guide,” “article,” or “video.”\n\n “wikiHow has a great how-to for cleaning a laptop.”\n “wikiHow’s website has tons of how-to articles for just about every topic.”\n“How-to” is mostly used as a noun in American English—it’s not as common in British English.\n1-2. Keep “how to” unhyphenated when using “how” as a conjunction.\nThe word “how” serves many purposes in the English language. However, when paired with the word to, “how” is a conjunction (a clause- or sentence-connecting word) that means “the manner or way in which” something happens (according to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary). Let’s take a closer look:\n\n“Caleb doesn’t know how to make macaroni and cheese.” In this example, “how” refers to Caleb’s lack of ability to prepare a bowl of mac and cheese.\n“Angela knows how to play baseball.” In this example, “how” refers to Angela’s ability to play baseball.\n2. Is it \&quot;how-to’s\&quot; or \&quot;how-tos\&quot;?\n\&quot;How-tos\&quot; is the correct way to pluralize \&quot;how to\&quot;.\nAccording to the basic rules of English grammar, apostrophes are only used to show possession or to form contractions. In very rare cases, apostrophes can be used to pluralize all lowercase letters (“Be sure to dot your i’s before signing that contract”), the capital letters A, I, M, and U (“She got all A’s this semester”), words that stand for themselves (“There are no but’s about it”), or abbreviations ending in periods (“A lot of Ph.D.’s work at this school”). The word “how-to” doesn’t fall under these rules, so it can be pluralized as “how-tos.”\n\n “wikiHow has a lot of how-tos that you can scroll through.”\nNo matter how you spell it, “how-tos” doesn’t really roll off the tongue. You’re better off using “how-to” as an adjective and pluralizing the word that it’s describing (like “how-to videos” or “how-to articles”).\n3. When to Use Hypens\n3-1. Compound adjectives\nUse a hyphen to turn two individual words into a single adjective (like “well-established scientist” or “caramel-covered fruit”). Only hyphenate adjectives when they go in front of the noun they’re describing; otherwise, leave them unhyphenated.\n\n The ice-cold glass of lemonade is so refreshing.\n The refreshing glass of lemonade is ice cold.\n3-2. Compound numbers and fractions\nAlways use a hyphen when you’re writing out large compound numbers (up to 99), like sixty-three or twenty-seven. Written-out fractions also need to be hyphenated, like three-fourths or one-third.\n My grandfather turned eighty-two today.\n3-3. Confusing spelling or wording\nHyphens can help split up words that would otherwise have double vowels (like “semi-inground”). They also help differentiate words with different meanings but identical spellings (like “re-cover” versus “recover”).\nThe sentence “I need to re-cover my car” has a much different meaning than “I need to recover my car.”\n3-4. Prefixes paired with capitalized words\nInclude a hyphen whenever you’re combining a prefix with a capitalized letter. Words like pre-Thanksgiving and mid-March all use a hyphen to separate the prefix from the capitalized letter in the next word.\n3-5. The suffix -elect and prefixes ex-, self-, and all-\nAlways use the hyphenated suffix -elect whenever you’re talking about a recently elected official (like President-elect). Hyphens are also required for the prefixes ex-, self-, and all- (like ex-boyfriend, self-reflect, and all-knowing).\n3-6. Line breaks\nUse a hyphen to split up long words that don’t fit at the end of a line. Always place the hyphen at the end of a proper syllable (like “sta-di-um” rather than “stad-ium”), or use the hyphen in an already hyphenated word as a breaking point (like “multi-millionaire”). If the last word in a line ends with -ing, include the hyphen right before the suffix (like “writ-ing”).\nIf there’s a double consonant right before the -ing, stick the hyphen in-between the consonants (like “swim-ming”).\n&quot;},&quot;元数据&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;create_time\&quot;: \&quot;20230517 10:42:08\&quot;,\n  \&quot;回答明细\&quot;: \&quot;{\\\&quot;回答\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;1.

Hyphens are also required for the prefixes ex-, self-, and all- (like ex-boyfriend, self-reflect, and all-knowing).\\\\n3-6. Line breaks\\\\nUse a hyphen to split up long words that don’t fit at the end of a line. Always place the hyphen at the end of a proper syllable (like “sta-di-um” rather than “stad-ium”), or use the hyphen in an already hyphenated word as a breaking point (like “multi-millionaire”). If the last word in a line ends with -ing, include the hyphen right before the suffix (like “writ-ing”).\\\\nIf there’s a double consonant right before the -ing, stick the hyphen in-between the consonants (like “swim-ming”).\\\\n\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;简要回答\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;The English language is well-known for its inconsistent grammar and spelling rules. The “how-to” versus “how to” debate is a classic example of this—which version of this phrase is correct, and how are you supposed to pluralize it? We’ve unpacked everything you need to know, so you can confidently use the correct form of this phrase in your future conversations.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;结构\\\&quot;: {\\\&quot;方法\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;How-to vs. How to\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Hyphenate “how-to” when talking about a set of instructions.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;How-to can be used either as a noun (a person/place/thing/idea) or an adjective (a word used to modify/describe a noun). In both cases, “how-to” with a hyphen refers to a set of instructions or a step-by-step tutorial about completing a task. When used as an adjective, “how-to” is often paired with words like “book,” “guide,” “article,” or “video.”\\\\n\\\\n “wikiHow has a great how-to for cleaning a laptop.”\\\\n “wikiHow’s website has tons of how-to articles for just about every topic.”\\\\n“How-to” is mostly used as a noun in American English—it’s not as common in British English.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Keep “how to” unhyphenated when using “how” as a conjunction.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;The word “how” serves many purposes in the English language. However, when paired with the word to, “how” is a conjunction (a clause- or sentence-connecting word) that means “the manner or way in which” something happens (according to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary). Let’s take a closer look:\\\\n\\\\n“Caleb doesn’t know how to make macaroni and cheese.” In this example, “how” refers to Caleb’s lack of ability to prepare a bowl of mac and cheese.\\\\n“Angela knows how to play baseball.” In this example, “how” refers to Angela’s ability to play baseball.\\\&quot;}]}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Is it \\\\\\\&quot;how-to’s\\\\\\\&quot; or \\\\\\\&quot;how-tos\\\\\\\&quot;?\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;How-tos\\\\\\\&quot; is the correct way to pluralize \\\\\\\&quot;how to\\\\\\\&quot;.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;According to the basic rules of English grammar, apostrophes are only used to show possession or to form contractions. In very rare cases, apostrophes can be used to pluralize all lowercase letters (“Be sure to dot your i’s before signing that contract”), the capital letters A, I, M, and U (“She got all A’s this semester”), words that stand for themselves (“There are no but’s about it”), or abbreviations ending in periods (“A lot of Ph.D.’s work at this school”). The word “how-to” doesn’t fall under these rules, so it can be pluralized as “how-tos.”\\\\n\\\\n “wikiHow has a lot of how-tos that you can scroll through.”\\\\nNo matter how you spell it, “how-tos” doesn’t really roll off the tongue. You’re better off using “how-to” as an adjective and pluralizing the word that it’s describing (like “how-to videos” or “how-to articles”).\\\&quot;}]}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;When to Use Hypens\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Compound adjectives\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Use a hyphen to turn two individual words into a single adjective (like “well-established scientist” or “caramel-covered fruit”). Only hyphenate adjectives when they go in front of the noun they’re describing; otherwise, leave them unhyphenated.\\\\n\\\\n The ice-cold glass of lemonade is so refreshing.\\\\n The refreshing glass of lemonade is ice cold.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Compound numbers and fractions\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Always use a hyphen when you’re writing out large compound numbers (up to 99), like sixty-three or twenty-seven. Written-out fractions also need to be hyphenated, like three-fourths or one-third.\\\\n My grandfather turned eighty-two today.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Confusing spelling or wording\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Hyphens can help split up words that would otherwise have double vowels (like “semi-inground”). They also help differentiate words with different meanings but identical spellings (like “re-cover” versus “recover”).\\\\nThe sentence “I need to re-cover my car” has a much different meaning than “I need to recover my car.”\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 4, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Prefixes paired with capitalized words\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Include a hyphen whenever you’re combining a prefix with a capitalized letter.

Adjusting Your Appearance\n1-1. Take time to decide what type of woman you want to look like.\nThis greatly influences the other steps. How old are you? What is your body type? What kind of style do you want? Envision the woman you will become. You can be classy, provocative, trendy, or even angelic. What you want to look like will change over time, and outfit choices vary from day to day.\nRemember to dress for the occasion and take your daily life into account. If you will be passing as a woman on a regular basis and work in a professional environment, provocative or flashy clothing will not be appropriate. If you’re going out clubbing, wearing more revealing clothes is fine.\nIf you’re passing as a woman for a party or special event, feel free to go all out. Be over the top in your clothing choices.\nUse your close female friends looks for fashion inspiration.\n1-2. Jump in the shower to get started.\nShowering is the first step in most grooming rituals. So much is done in the shower, including shaving, washing your hair, and getting generally clean. Traditionally, females are known for having smooth skin, clean and shiny hair, and a clean body, so take your time.\nInvest in shampoo and conditioner that smell nice and fresh.\nScrub down with a loofah and body wash to exfoliate your skin and leave it clean and smooth.\n1-3. Shave your face if you prefer a smooth look.\nUse a new razor and take your time. Also, be gentle; you don't want to irritate your skin. Using plenty of shaving cream and razors with three or more blades will keep razor burn to a minimum. If you really want to keep stubble away, you can try waxing, electrolysis, or even permanent laser hair removal, but consult with a professional first.\nBuy quality razors to shave with since cheap razors can irritate your skin.\nIf you'd like, you can shave your entire body, too. You might go through multiple razor blades, so keep extra on hand.\nFor more sensitive areas like your belly or armpits, avoid using too many strokes. Instead, use a few long, even strokes against the grain of the hair.\nUse moisturizer after shaving to soothe freshly shaven skin.\n1-4. Pluck your eyebrows to soften your face.\nWomen generally have thinner eyebrows than men. Remove stray hairs by plucking them firmly from their roots. For highly stylized brows, you may want to seek a professional, but plucking eyebrows can easily be done at home.\nThe start of your brows should be about one inch above the inner corner of your eye. Remove the strays in between.\nThe end of your brows should be about one inch above the outer corner of your eye. Pluck any stray hairs that come after this edge.\nPluck hairs from under the brows until a natural arch-shape is achieved. The arch should peak above the outer rim of your eye. Remove stray hairs along the bottom of your eyebrow’s arch. Do this part the slowest, and be sure your brows are parallel in thickness.\nIt is natural for the skin on your face to become red and sometimes swollen after plucking. This will quickly fade.\n1-5. Clean, trim, and manicure your nails.\nThough getting clean nails generally happens in the shower but could require you to use a nail cleaner to remove dirt and grime. Use a nail board to file down uneven edges of your nails.\nPaint your nails if you desire. Clear polish is always classy, but there is a world of options. If you’re trying to be sassy, pick out a bright red or neon color; if you want a more subtle color, stick with nude shades like beige or silver.\nGet a manicure if you have a large amount of hangnails, stubborn grime, or unsightly callouses. A professional manicurist can cut, buff, and paint your nails for you.\n1-6. Style your hair.\nA simple head of clean hair is all you really need to pass as a woman, but curly, coarse, and long hair require more work. In general, make sure your hair is brushed thoroughly and use styling products if it is overly frizzy or unruly.\nGoing to a salon can be helpful. A good stylist can tell you not only what's in style but what will look good on you. They can also recommend products for your hair type. Have an idea of what you want, but be open to input as well.\nKeep your hairstyles simple unless you’re experienced in working with hair. There are hundreds of articles and YouTube tutorials about easy hairstyles.\nPractice different styles well in advanced of any event. There is nothing more stressful than trying a new hairdo on a deadline!\nIf you’ll be passing as a woman for an extended period of time, grow your hair to the length you desire.\nBuying a wig is also a good idea. Wigs come in a variety of cuts, colors, textures, and lengths, so you can find a wig that fits your style.\n1-7. Apply your foundation to even out your skin tone.\nFoundation helps to cover up any blemishes and will mask a five-o-clock shadow (if that's what you want to do). Find a cover-up and/or liquid foundation that closely matches your skin tone, plus a matching powder to \&quot;set\&quot; the make-up, making it look naturally feminine.\nVisit beauty stores that provide help from makeup professionals to point you in the right direction. This is very important if you’ve never used foundation before. They will let you know what brand works best with your skin and budget.\nIf you’re shopping online, read the reviews before purchasing foundation. Look into which offer full coverage.\nUse a moisturizer and primer before applying the foundation. The rest of your makeup will go on much easier and look better. Use your fingers or an applicator to blend the foundation so there's no clear line between makeup and skin.\n1-8. Experiment with makeup looks if you want to.\nDecide if you want a full or natural look, but either way, don't overdo it. You don't want to appear clownish. Lipstick, blush, eye-shadow, eyeliner, and mascara are all options for you to use.\nIf you want a more natural look, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner should suffice.\nFor a fuller look, apply eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick, too.\nThe temptation to overdo makeup is common for most beginners. Remember to tailor your makeup to the occasion. Keep it classy, and you'll pass.\nApplying makeup is already difficult for women; be patient and ask friends for help. You’ll get the hang of it.\nFind YouTube tutorials for complicated looks like a smokey eyes or cat eyeliner.\n2. Dressing in Feminine Clothing\n2-1. Pick an outfit that makes you feel good about yourself.\nDressing like a woman involves planning your look from head to toe, beginning with your top or dress. The color choice will vary depending on your personal style. If you’re going for a business look, choose more neutral colors, but if you’re going for a night out clubbing, go for bright colors and patterns. Also, choosing a top or dress that flatters your figure is important.\nChoose a top or dress that best suits your frame. Plunging necklines draw attention from broad shoulders, so these are often good choices for passing as a woman. Knowing your body and working with it is essential to passing.\nIf you are more full-figured and have a larger midsection, don’t get a shirt that shows your belly. Fabrics that stretch like polyester can be very comfortable.\nIf your arms are very bulky, consider using a shawl to cover them when wearing sleeveless outfits.\nCorsets, gaffs, breast forms, and other specialized bodyshapers are also available.\n2-2. Choose flattering bottoms.\nThinner individuals will have an easier time finding flattering jeans, for example, and a full skirt will accentuate curves nicely. Multiple trips to several stores may be necessary for you to find the right bottoms. Be wary of purchasing pants or skirts online, as sizing can be difficult to predict.\nStart with a skirt with empire waist, which is a great choice to begin with. These look good on narrow hips and flatter bottoms.\nGo shopping with a female friend to get a second opinion.\nConsider learning to tuck and tape if that makes you feel more feminine and empowered.\n2-3. Pick out cute accessories.\nThere are tons of pretty accessories on the market today, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair decorations. Try to tailor accessories to the outfit you’re wearing.\nMatching is a good idea. For example, if you’re wearing a green skirt and a white top, put a white flower in your hair or wear a green bracelet.\nDon’t wear too many accessories. Wearing three accessories at a time is more than enough.\nJewelry can get expensive, but stores often have more affordable items alongside the more pricey ones.\n2-4. Select shoes.\nYour shoes should be comfortable but still stylish. Women don't always wear heels, so you don't have to punish your feet. Flats may look better for because men are normally taller than women, so wearing heels could make you tower over others. Once again, think about the occasion. If you’re going to be walking a lot or on your feet all day, heels will not be comfortable.\nHeels make your leg muscles tense, so they can make them seem more bulky. This is especially true if your legs are already very toned.\nBallet flats are affordable and come in an array of colors and patterns.\nIf you do get heels, wearing them around the house can help you become used to walking in them.\n2-5. Reflect on your look.\nStand in front of a full-length mirror and turn around so you can see yourself from every angle. Decide if there is any part of your outfit that looks unfashionable or unflattering. If there is, change! Give yourself about an extra half hour to get ready just in case you need to do any last minute changes.\n3. Adopting Feminine Behaviors\n3-1. Get in touch with your feminine side.\nWatching movies and reading books centered on strong female characters will help you understand these traits even better. Remember that overall, women are known for being gentle and caring.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand feminine traits is to spend time around ladies. Drum up your female friends and set up a book club, wine night, or other weekly time to hang out.\nEmpathize with others and be sensitive to those around you. Try to be accepting and assertive in a gentle way.\n3-2. Work on making graceful movements.\nImprove your posture, and realize that feminine gestures, even slight ones, are very important. It is well-known that women often gesture while speaking, which adds femininity and personality to any conversation. Note the gestures and facial expressions of the women around you and try to imitate how they move.\nTry to make smaller, more graceful movements as opposed to big steps and heavy gestures. This will help you move with ease.\nStanding up straight will also give you poise and will make your body appear more feminine.\n3-3. Practice speaking in a higher voice if you'd like to.\nWomen's voices tend not only to be higher pitched, but also more melodic. Women tend to take on the vocal patterns of those they spend a lot of time with, so find a female friend to emulate.\nBe active! The best practice is talking to real people in public situations. This will help your progress, so don’t be shy or embarrassed.\nThere are also tapes, articles, and the guides available on the web. Spend a few hours on the internet researching practice methods.\nIf you're not satisfied with your progress, consider seeking out a professional speech therapist.\nTips\nIf you know a girl who is supportive, you might consider asking her for help. Many girls are more than happy to share advice.\nIf you want a fuller looking chest, you could experiment with wearing a padded bra.\nWarnings\nThis article is aimed at a largely western audience.

Some men have typically feminine traits, and some women have masculine features, too. Our gender is made up of a variety of beliefs, characteristics, and behaviors. Passing as a woman doesn’t just involve wearing makeup and stockings. There is a complex set of traits to keep in mind as well. For individuals assigned male at birth, blending in as a woman may feel like a challenging endeavor. Whether you're transgender or just having fun, this article can help you embrace your feminine side.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;结构\\\&quot;: {\\\&quot;方法\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Adjusting Your Appearance\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Take time to decide what type of woman you want to look like.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;This greatly influences the other steps. How old are you? What is your body type? What kind of style do you want? Envision the woman you will become. You can be classy, provocative, trendy, or even angelic. What you want to look like will change over time, and outfit choices vary from day to day.\\\\nRemember to dress for the occasion and take your daily life into account. If you will be passing as a woman on a regular basis and work in a professional environment, provocative or flashy clothing will not be appropriate. If you’re going out clubbing, wearing more revealing clothes is fine.\\\\nIf you’re passing as a woman for a party or special event, feel free to go all out. Be over the top in your clothing choices.\\\\nUse your close female friends looks for fashion inspiration.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Jump in the shower to get started.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Showering is the first step in most grooming rituals. So much is done in the shower, including shaving, washing your hair, and getting generally clean. Traditionally, females are known for having smooth skin, clean and shiny hair, and a clean body, so take your time.\\\\nInvest in shampoo and conditioner that smell nice and fresh.\\\\nScrub down with a loofah and body wash to exfoliate your skin and leave it clean and smooth.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Shave your face if you prefer a smooth look.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Use a new razor and take your time. Also, be gentle; you don't want to irritate your skin. Using plenty of shaving cream and razors with three or more blades will keep razor burn to a minimum. If you really want to keep stubble away, you can try waxing, electrolysis, or even permanent laser hair removal, but consult with a professional first.\\\\nBuy quality razors to shave with since cheap razors can irritate your skin.\\\\nIf you'd like, you can shave your entire body, too. You might go through multiple razor blades, so keep extra on hand.\\\\nFor more sensitive areas like your belly or armpits, avoid using too many strokes. Instead, use a few long, even strokes against the grain of the hair.\\\\nUse moisturizer after shaving to soothe freshly shaven skin.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 4, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Pluck your eyebrows to soften your face.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Women generally have thinner eyebrows than men. Remove stray hairs by plucking them firmly from their roots. For highly stylized brows, you may want to seek a professional, but plucking eyebrows can easily be done at home.\\\\nThe start of your brows should be about one inch above the inner corner of your eye. Remove the strays in between.\\\\nThe end of your brows should be about one inch above the outer corner of your eye. Pluck any stray hairs that come after this edge.\\\\nPluck hairs from under the brows until a natural arch-shape is achieved. The arch should peak above the outer rim of your eye. Remove stray hairs along the bottom of your eyebrow’s arch. Do this part the slowest, and be sure your brows are parallel in thickness.\\\\nIt is natural for the skin on your face to become red and sometimes swollen after plucking. This will quickly fade.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 5, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Clean, trim, and manicure your nails.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Though getting clean nails generally happens in the shower but could require you to use a nail cleaner to remove dirt and grime. Use a nail board to file down uneven edges of your nails.\\\\nPaint your nails if you desire. Clear polish is always classy, but there is a world of options. If you’re trying to be sassy, pick out a bright red or neon color; if you want a more subtle color, stick with nude shades like beige or silver.\\\\nGet a manicure if you have a large amount of hangnails, stubborn grime, or unsightly callouses. A professional manicurist can cut, buff, and paint your nails for you.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 6, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Style your hair.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;A simple head of clean hair is all you really need to pass as a woman, but curly, coarse, and long hair require more work. In general, make sure your hair is brushed thoroughly and use styling products if it is overly frizzy or unruly.\\\\nGoing to a salon can be helpful. A good stylist can tell you not only what's in style but what will look good on you. They can also recommend products for your hair type. Have an idea of what you want, but be open to input as well.\\\\nKeep your hairstyles simple unless you’re experienced in working with hair. There are hundreds of articles and YouTube tutorials about easy hairstyles.\\\\nPractice different styles well in advanced of any event. There is nothing more stressful than trying a new hairdo on a deadline!\\\\nIf you’ll be passing as a woman for an extended period of time, grow your hair to the length you desire.\\\\nBuying a wig is also a good idea. Wigs come in a variety of cuts, colors, textures, and lengths, so you can find a wig that fits your style.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 7, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Apply your foundation to even out your skin tone.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Foundation helps to cover up any blemishes and will mask a five-o-clock shadow (if that's what you want to do). Find a cover-up and/or liquid foundation that closely matches your skin tone, plus a matching powder to \\\\\\\&quot;set\\\\\\\&quot; the make-up, making it look naturally feminine.\\\\nVisit beauty stores that provide help from makeup professionals to point you in the right direction. This is very important if you’ve never used foundation before. They will let you know what brand works best with your skin and budget.\\\\nIf you’re shopping online, read the reviews before purchasing foundation. Look into which offer full coverage.\\\\nUse a moisturizer and primer before applying the foundation. The rest of your makeup will go on much easier and look better. Use your fingers or an applicator to blend the foundation so there's no clear line between makeup and skin.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 8, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Experiment with makeup looks if you want to.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Decide if you want a full or natural look, but either way, don't overdo it. You don't want to appear clownish. Lipstick, blush, eye-shadow, eyeliner, and mascara are all options for you to use.\\\\nIf you want a more natural look, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner should suffice.\\\\nFor a fuller look, apply eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick, too.\\\\nThe temptation to overdo makeup is common for most beginners. Remember to tailor your makeup to the occasion. Keep it classy, and you'll pass.\\\\nApplying makeup is already difficult for women; be patient and ask friends for help. You’ll get the hang of it.\\\\nFind YouTube tutorials for complicated looks like a smokey eyes or cat eyeliner.\\\&quot;}]}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Dressing in Feminine Clothing\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Pick an outfit that makes you feel good about yourself.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Dressing like a woman involves planning your look from head to toe, beginning with your top or dress. The color choice will vary depending on your personal style. If you’re going for a business look, choose more neutral colors, but if you’re going for a night out clubbing, go for bright colors and patterns. Also, choosing a top or dress that flatters your figure is important.\\\\nChoose a top or dress that best suits your frame. Plunging necklines draw attention from broad shoulders, so these are often good choices for passing as a woman. Knowing your body and working with it is essential to passing.\\\\nIf you are more full-figured and have a larger midsection, don’t get a shirt that shows your belly. Fabrics that stretch like polyester can be very comfortable.\\\\nIf your arms are very bulky, consider using a shawl to cover them when wearing sleeveless outfits.\\\\nCorsets, gaffs, breast forms, and other specialized bodyshapers are also available.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Choose flattering bottoms.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Thinner individuals will have an easier time finding flattering jeans, for example, and a full skirt will accentuate curves nicely. Multiple trips to several stores may be necessary for you to find the right bottoms. Be wary of purchasing pants or skirts online, as sizing can be difficult to predict.\\\\nStart with a skirt with empire waist, which is a great choice to begin with. These look good on narrow hips and flatter bottoms.\\\\nGo shopping with a female friend to get a second opinion.\\\\nConsider learning to tuck and tape if that makes you feel more feminine and empowered.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Pick out cute accessories.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;There are tons of pretty accessories on the market today, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair decorations. Try to tailor accessories to the outfit you’re wearing.\\\\nMatching is a good idea. For example, if you’re wearing a green skirt and a white top, put a white flower in your hair or wear a green bracelet.\\\\nDon’t wear too many accessories. Wearing three accessories at a time is more than enough.\\\\nJewelry can get expensive, but stores often have more affordable items alongside the more pricey ones.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 4, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Select shoes.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Your shoes should be comfortable but still stylish. Women don't always wear heels, so you don't have to punish your feet. Flats may look better for because men are normally taller than women, so wearing heels could make you tower over others. Once again, think about the occasion. If you’re going to be walking a lot or on your feet all day, heels will not be comfortable.\\\\nHeels make your leg muscles tense, so they can make them seem more bulky. This is especially true if your legs are already very toned.\\\\nBallet flats are affordable and come in an array of colors and patterns.\\\\nIf you do get heels, wearing them around the house can help you become used to walking in them.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 5, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Reflect on your look.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Stand in front of a full-length mirror and turn around so you can see yourself from every angle. Decide if there is any part of your outfit that looks unfashionable or unflattering. If there is, change! Give yourself about an extra half hour to get ready just in case you need to do any last minute changes.\\\&quot;}]}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Adopting Feminine Behaviors\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Get in touch with your feminine side.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Watching movies and reading books centered on strong female characters will help you understand these traits even better. Remember that overall, women are known for being gentle and caring.\\\\nOne of the easiest ways to understand feminine traits is to spend time around ladies. Drum up your female friends and set up a book club, wine night, or other weekly time to hang out.\\\\nEmpathize with others and be sensitive to those around you. Try to be accepting and assertive in a gentle way.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Work on making graceful movements.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Improve your posture, and realize that feminine gestures, even slight ones, are very important. It is well-known that women often gesture while speaking, which adds femininity and personality to any conversation. Note the gestures and facial expressions of the women around you and try to imitate how they move.\\\\nTry to make smaller, more graceful movements as opposed to big steps and heavy gestures. This will help you move with ease.\\\\nStanding up straight will also give you poise and will make your body appear more feminine.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Practice speaking in a higher voice if you'd like to.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Women's voices tend not only to be higher pitched, but also more melodic. Women tend to take on the vocal patterns of those they spend a lot of time with, so find a female friend to emulate.\\\\nBe active! The best practice is talking to real people in public situations. This will help your progress, so don’t be shy or embarrassed.\\\\nThere are also tapes, articles, and the guides available on the web. Spend a few hours on the internet researching practice methods.\\\\nIf you're not satisfied with your progress, consider seeking out a professional speech therapist.\\\&quot;}], \\\&quot;小提示\\\&quot;: [\\\&quot;If you know a girl who is supportive, you might consider asking her for help.

This is why one iPad type (e.g., an iPad Mini) can have several different model numbers applied to it.\\\\nYour iPad's type (according to the model number) does not change the device's physical dimensions (e.g., an iPad Air with cellular is the same size as an equivalent iPad air with Wi-Fi only).\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Remove your iPad's case if it has one.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;The model number is located at the bottom of the back of the iPad's housing, so anything covering this area must be removed.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Locate the model number.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;At the very bottom of the iPad's back, you should see a few lines of text; the model number is on the far-right side of the top line of text, right next to \\\\\\\&quot;Model\\\\\\\&quot;.\\\\nYour model number will be in A1234 format.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 4, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Match your iPad's model number to the appropriate model.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;As of April 2017, all current iPads and their corresponding model numbers are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n - A1673 (Wi-Fi only); A1674 or A1675 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1584 (Wi-Fi only); A1652 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1566 (Wi-Fi only); A1567 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1474 (Wi-Fi only); A1475 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1476 (Wi-Fi and TD/LTE cellular).\\\\n - A1538 (Wi-Fi only); A1550 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1599 (Wi-Fi only); A1600 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1489 (Wi-Fi only); A1490 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1491 (Wi-Fi and TD/LTE cellular).\\\\n - A1432 (Wi-Fi only); A1454 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1455 (Wi-Fi and MM cellular).\\\\n - A1822 (Wi-Fi only); A1823 (Wi-Fi and cellular).\\\\n - A1458 (Wi-Fi only); A1459 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1460 (Wi-Fi and MM cellular).\\\\n - A1416 (Wi-Fi only); A1430 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1403 (Wi-Fi and VZ cellular).\\\\n - A1395 (Wi-Fi only); A1396 (GSM cellular); A1397 (CDMA cellular).\\\\n - A1219 (Wi-Fi only); A1337 (Wi-Fi and 3G cellular).\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 5, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Use your iPad's model number to inform hardware decisions.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;For example, if you're buying a specific charger or a case for your iPad, knowing the model number will help you determine the size or type of the item.\\\&quot;}]}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Determining the Software Version\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;步骤\\\&quot;: [{\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 1, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Open your iPad's Settings.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;This is the gray app with gears on it that you'll likely find on the Home Screen.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 2, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Tap General.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;You'll see this tab on the left side of the page.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 3, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;Tap About.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;It's at the top of the \\\\\\\&quot;General\\\\\\\&quot; page.\\\&quot;}, {\\\&quot;编号\\\&quot;: 4, \\\&quot;标题\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;View the \\\\\\\&quot;Version\\\\\\\&quot; number.\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;描述\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;The number to the right of the \\\\\\\&quot;Version\\\\\\\&quot; tag on this page is your iPad's software version (e.g., 10.3.1).

Signing Up for an Online Rewards Program\n2-1.

Look for other ways to earn points that don’t directly involve paying money.\nThese can include playing games, watching advertisements, and filling out surveys. These activities often net you fewer points than purchases, but they are free.\nYou may need to make big purchases in order to earn enough points for a gift card. Try to make purchases that you would normally make at another store to keep the cost of the gift card down. Making extra purchases just to receive the gift card will defeat the purpose.\nMembers are usually given the opportunity to sign up with program sponsors for products or services; you do not have to accept in order to become a member or to earn points towards future free gift cards.\n3. Using Gather\n3-1. Create a Gather account.\nThis program allows members to earn points by writing articles about topics of their choice, uploading pictures or videos, and by commenting on other member articles.\nTopics for articles, pictures, and videos are decided upon entirely by the author. There are numerous groups that members may join to discuss topics with members who have similar interests.\n3-2. Write your articles.\nThe more people that read your articles, the more points you will earn. Write quality articles to help you stand out and draw readers to your work.\nBe aware that you will have to put a significant amount of time in writing articles before you see good rewards. You may be better off writing for profit on another website so that you can earn actual money for your work.\n3-3. Redeem your points.\nOnce the designated number of points have been earned, you can redeem their points for free gift cards from a number of businesses, including Amazon.\nGather also offers a direct payment to PayPal, from which members can then purchase gift cards from iTunes or eBay.\n4. Signing Up for a Mobile Rewards Program\n4-1. Download a mobile rewards app.\nThese programs are similar to website-based online programs, though are targeted specifically towards mobile users. Some examples include:\nMobileRewards\ne-Rewards Mobile\nJunoWallet\n4-2. Earn points by engaging in marketing.\nMost mobile rewards programs will ask you to download other apps and games that advertise through the program. There are also often surveys that can be completed.\nBe careful when purchasing apps for reward points. Each app may not seem like it costs that much, but a lot of small purchases can add up quickly.\n5. Getting Gift Cards Offline\n5-1. Donate blood.\nRed Cross will occasionally promote blood drives by raffling or giving away gift cards. Contact your local Red Cross and find out if a drive near you is happening soon.\n5-2. Test drive a car.\nDealerships will sometimes run promotions that give gift cards when you take a car out for a test drive. Contact dealerships in your area and find out if they are doing any test drive promotions.\nCarry yourself like you want to buy. You are much more likely to be allowed to test drive if you act like you’re interested in buying a car. Don’t mention the gift cards up front.\n5-3. Transfer your prescriptions to a new pharmacy.\nLarge chain pharmacies will often offer rewards for transferring your prescriptions to them. These usually come in the form of a $25 gift card for that store.\nTips\nVery few programs offer eBay gift cards, however, most do offer direct payment into a PayPal account. The company allows customers to purchase eBay gift cards with funds from their PayPal account for no additional fee.\nNever enter your cell number if a survey or service asks for it unless you check their policy. They will take large amounts of money from you at super high rates.\nNever enter any personal information as most websites be scams.\n&quot;},&quot;元数据&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;create_time\&quot;: \&quot;20230517 10:42:09\&quot;,\n  \&quot;回答明细\&quot;: \&quot;{\\\&quot;回答\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;1.

Meaning\nSeeing 1010 means you’re on the right path toward spiritual growth.\nIt’s a reminder from your guardian angels (or the universe, or God, or whichever power you believe in) to stay optimistic and confident in yourself, because your choices are leading you to a bright future. Trust that the angels have your back and that success, abundance, and prosperity are on the horizon.\nThink of 1010 as a sign that you’ll be rewarded for your hard spiritual or personal work. It could be a romantic, financial, or other exciting reward.\n2. Spirituality\n1010 is a reminder to trust your intuition and listen to higher powers.\nGo with your gut when it comes to making big decisions or feeling out a new opportunity. Focus on moving forward and getting out of your comfort zone rather than sticking to your usual ways. Your instinctive feelings are actually the angels communicating with you about your best course of action.\nAngel number 1010 asks you to be self-aware and appreciate your feelings of hope, independence, and self-guidance.\n3. Love &amp; Relationships\n3-1. Seeing 1010 means your relationship will ascend to a higher level.\nThings may be getting more serious with your partner, and seeing 1010 is a reminder to listen to your heart and make plans for your future together. Let yourself be more romantic with your partner and express your feelings more freely. The more you open up, the deeper and more lasting your relationship will be.\nSeeing 1010 could mean a new phase in your relationship, like getting engaged, moving in together, or having a child together, is on its way.\n3-2. Seeing 1010 might mean it’s time for unhealthy relationships to end.\nIf you see 1010 after an argument with your partner or while reflecting on your unhappiness in a relationship, evaluate whether you really love the person and if the relationship is beneficial to your goals and well being. If it’s not, you may need to break things off in order to move forward and grow as a person.\n3-3. For single people, 1010 is a sign that your soulmate is close by.\nStay open to romantic possibilities with unlikely people. Your true love could be a stranger you meet by chance in the coming weeks, or somebody you’ve known for years that you’ve never considered as more than a friend until now. Trust your intuition, and don’t ignore your feelings based on who you’re “supposed” to be attracted to.\n1010 is a sign that your true love is near. However, it’s up to you to determine whether that’s the person you’re already with or whether it’s someone new.\nRemember, angel numbers don’t operate on a specific schedule. You may meet your new partner the same day as seeing 1010, or not until months later.\n4. Twin Flames\nAngel number 1010 means you’ll meet or reunite with your twin flame.\nIf you haven’t connected with your twin flame—the person who mirrors your soul and will help you grow spiritually—then a 1010 sighting could mean you’re already on the path to meeting them. The angels want you to meet, so take 1010 as a strong sign that your union is imminent.\nIf you’ve been separated from your twin flame (physically or emotionally), 1010 could mean you’re bound to reunite very soon.\nYou might've met your twin flame without realizing it. Look at your relationships with fresh eyes, and trust your gut if you feel drawn toward anyone.\n5. Money &amp; Career\n1010 is a number of wealth and abundance when it comes to finances.\nThe 1 symbolizes new opportunities while the 0 represents limitless possibilities, meaning you’ve got endless options for improving your financial status. Your reward can come in various forms—you could win the lottery or receive an inheritance, or you might finally land your dream job or get a raise.\nSeeing 1010 is also a gentle warning to be careful with your money. Budget wisely and be generous with gifts and donations to avoid becoming spoiled.\n6. In the Bible\nBiblically, 1010 is a sign that God has good plans for you.\nIn Christianity, 1 is symbolic of new beginnings and 0 stands for infinity or endlessness. Together, they can mean that God will supply you with all the skills and resources you need to overcome challenges. This is especially important in the biblical battle of good versus evil. Even though you may get tempted to sin or feel too weak to carry on, God and the angels will support you no matter what.\nWhen you see 1010, take it as a reminder to live a good life and share positivity to take part in the fight against evil.\nSome view 1010 as a symbol of God’s protection against evil forces.\n7. Numerology\nThe number 1010 combines the energies of 1 and 0.\nIn numerology, 1 symbolizes new beginnings and the motivation for change and creation.

You’re likely on the right track in life, and you should continue pursuing your goals. Even if things are a little hectic right now, order and certainty are not far off for you.\nIf you’ve been dealing with a lot of stress, 1133 is likely a sign that you’re on the brink of finding some peace.\n1-2. The angel number 1133 hints at the balance between self and community.\n1133 contains two sets of dual numbers. 1 is a representation of self, while 3 symbolizes community and completion. The duality of this pair emphasizes the importance of adhering to your own beliefs while respecting the needs of others.\n1133 is dominated by 1 and 3. 1 symbolizes the self, while 3 represents the spirit and community. You may have a new job opportunity coming up, or perhaps you’re about to reconnect with your roots.\n1133 may be an indicator that it’s time to consider volunteering in your spare time, or offering help to a friend or family member in need.\nNow may be a good time to check in on your friends, or reach out to your support system to see how they’re doing.\n2. Angel Number 1133 in Numerology\nIn numerology, the number 1133 gestures towards the great beyond.\nThere are 7 days of the week, 7 colors of the rainbow, and 7 musical notes. As you can see, 7 represents completion—but mathematically, 1+1+3+3 = 8. As such, 8 represents the possibility beyond the natural order of the world—the future, the unknowable, the hidden, and the impossible.\nThe number 1133 also contains two sets of the number 13. In numerology, 13 is a number of fear and foreboding. You have Friday the 13th and the 13 people at Jesus’s Last Supper, for example. Two sets of 13 cancel one another out, so do not worry! Your future is bright, even if it’s scary right now.\n3. Angel Number 1133 in Love\n3-1. When it comes to romance, 1133 is a reminder to focus on yourself.\nThe two 1s at the beginning of 1133 emphasize independence and self-reflection. Your romantic life might benefit from a little alone time. Trust yourself, and don’t dedicate too much time looking for true love. It will appear in due time, but only if you’re following your passions and caring for yourself, first.\nIt’s not that love isn’t coming in your direction, it’s just that you’re more likely to find it by prioritizing your needs. A watched pot never boils, after all!\n3-2. If you’re in a relationship, 1133 is a sign that good things are coming.\nYour bond with your partner may become deeper in the coming months. If the two of you have been facing a big decision, perhaps you’re about to reach a consensus.

Angel Number 1133 and Your Twin Flame\nThe angel number 1133 is a sign to reunite with your twin flame.\nYour twin flame is an intense soul connection with your other half. The number 1133 demonstrates that you’re going to be brought back into union with your twin flame soon. The two of you will become one to live a happy, meaningful life full of adventure and love.\nIf you haven’t met your twin flame yet, 1133 may be a sign that you’re about to meet them for the first time.\n5. What to Do When You See Angel Number 1133\n5-1. Volunteer to take on a leadership role at work or school.\nThe angel number 1133 is a sign that you’re about to step into your power as a leader. If you’ve been taking a backseat in your professional life or at school, consider stepping up. You may be rewarded for putting yourself out there and taking the wheel.\n5-2. Get back in touch with your spirituality or religious side.\nThe two 11s emphasize the self, while two 33s represent the divine. The divide between these two numbers may indicate it’s time to check in with whatever higher powers you believe in. Consider getting back into the habit of praying, or attending church again. If you’re not religious, at least be open to new spiritual experiences.\nIf you feel comfortable with your spiritual or religious life right now, stick with it!

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">1. Dusting Your Hair
1-1. Divide your hair into portions.
Gather your hair into four large equal portions. Twist each portion and clip them to your head. Each portion should be out of your face and held tightly against your head. If your hair is thick and curly, you can make a lot of two-strand twists or braids. Pin these to your scalp.
It can be difficult to dust your own hair if it's very short. You may want to ask a friend to help you dust your hair if it's too short to do on your own.
1-2. Unclip and divide one section of hair.
Unclip one portion of hair near your eyes. Divide the hair within this portion into 3 or 4 rows of hair. If you have straight hair, feed one row of hair between your index and middle fingers. Pull your fingers down so that only the ends of the row of hair are exposed.
If you have curly hair, twist one of the rows so it's neat. You'll probably see some loose ends poking out from the section. These will be hairs that you dust.
1-3. Dust just the ends of your hair.
Take hair cutting shears and look at the end of each row or twist of hair. If you find a split end or knot, trim less than 1/4 of an inch from the end. You should only cut the split end to preserve the length of your hair.
Avoid using kitchen or craft scissors which can be blunt and will damage your hair. Professional hair scissors will create sharp clean cuts that can keep your hair healthy.
1-4. Dust all around your head.
Once you've dusted the front portion of your hair, continue dusting the remaining portions around your head. If you're having trouble seeing the split ends, hold a row of hair up to the light. This can make it easier to spot any split ends or knots.
When you're done dusting, you should see very fine hairs over the floor. If you've dusted correctly, you shouldn't see large locks of hair or curls on the floor.
2. Determining Your Hair Needs
2-1. Get a trim if you have healthy hair.
Think about how often your hair gets knots or split ends. If your hair is pretty healthy and just looks a little straggly at the ends, you might need an actual trim. A full trim should remove the bottom 1/2 to inch of hair. You should get a trim every 3 or 4 months.
While getting a trim can remove a lot of unhealthy hair (split ends and knots), it will also remove the most length. Getting a trim can make it difficult to grow your hair out quickly.
2-2. Trim just the split ends and knots.
If you only want to trim the split ends so you keep as much length as possible, use the search and destroy method. To do this, your hair must be long enough to pull in front of your eyes. This way you can look at each strand of hair for split ends and knots. When you find them, cut about 1/4 of an inch above the knot, split end or fray to completely remove the damage.
This method takes a lot of time since you have to go through every strand of hair. If you find a lot of split ends or knots within a month, you may actually want to get a full trim.
2-3. Consider dusting if you have curly hair.
If you have curly or wavy hair, you've probably had the experience of asking for a trim only to end up with an actual hair cut. This is because curly hair recoils more if it's cut or trimmed when it's wet. Instead, cut, dust, or trim your hair when it's dry so you can see exactly how much length you're removing.
You probably only need a full trim every 3 or 4 months, if you have curly hair. In the meantime, dust your hair whenever you notice split ends, about every 6 to 8 weeks.
Warnings
Always use caution when using sharp scissors.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">1. How-to vs. How to
1-1. Hyphenate “how-to” when talking about a set of instructions.
How-to can be used either as a noun (a person/place/thing/idea) or an adjective (a word used to modify/describe a noun). In both cases, “how-to” with a hyphen refers to a set of instructions or a step-by-step tutorial about completing a task. When used as an adjective, “how-to” is often paired with words like “book,” “guide,” “article,” or “video.”

 “wikiHow has a great how-to for cleaning a laptop.”
 “wikiHow’s website has tons of how-to articles for just about every topic.”
“How-to” is mostly used as a noun in American English—it’s not as common in British English.
1-2. Keep “how to” unhyphenated when using “how” as a conjunction.
The word “how” serves many purposes in the English language. However, when paired with the word to, “how” is a conjunction (a clause- or sentence-connecting word) that means “the manner or way in which” something happens (according to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary). Let’s take a closer look:

“Caleb doesn’t know how to make macaroni and cheese.” In this example, “how” refers to Caleb’s lack of ability to prepare a bowl of mac and cheese.
“Angela knows how to play baseball.” In this example, “how” refers to Angela’s ability to play baseball.
2. Is it "how-to’s" or "how-tos"?
"How-tos" is the correct way to pluralize "how to".
According to the basic rules of English grammar, apostrophes are only used to show possession or to form contractions. In very rare cases, apostrophes can be used to pluralize all lowercase letters (“Be sure to dot your i’s before signing that contract”), the capital letters A, I, M, and U (“She got all A’s this semester”), words that stand for themselves (“There are no but’s about it”), or abbreviations ending in periods (“A lot of Ph.D.’s work at this school”). The word “how-to” doesn’t fall under these rules, so it can be pluralized as “how-tos.”

 “wikiHow has a lot of how-tos that you can scroll through.”
No matter how you spell it, “how-tos” doesn’t really roll off the tongue. You’re better off using “how-to” as an adjective and pluralizing the word that it’s describing (like “how-to videos” or “how-to articles”).
3. When to Use Hypens
3-1. Compound adjectives
Use a hyphen to turn two individual words into a single adjective (like “well-established scientist” or “caramel-covered fruit”). Only hyphenate adjectives when they go in front of the noun they’re describing; otherwise, leave them unhyphenated.

 The ice-cold glass of lemonade is so refreshing.
 The refreshing glass of lemonade is ice cold.
3-2. Compound numbers and fractions
Always use a hyphen when you’re writing out large compound numbers (up to 99), like sixty-three or twenty-seven. Written-out fractions also need to be hyphenated, like three-fourths or one-third.
 My grandfather turned eighty-two today.
3-3. Confusing spelling or wording
Hyphens can help split up words that would otherwise have double vowels (like “semi-inground”). They also help differentiate words with different meanings but identical spellings (like “re-cover” versus “recover”).
The sentence “I need to re-cover my car” has a much different meaning than “I need to recover my car.”
3-4. Prefixes paired with capitalized words
Include a hyphen whenever you’re combining a prefix with a capitalized letter. Words like pre-Thanksgiving and mid-March all use a hyphen to separate the prefix from the capitalized letter in the next word.
3-5. The suffix -elect and prefixes ex-, self-, and all-
Always use the hyphenated suffix -elect whenever you’re talking about a recently elected official (like President-elect). Hyphens are also required for the prefixes ex-, self-, and all- (like ex-boyfriend, self-reflect, and all-knowing).
3-6. Line breaks
Use a hyphen to split up long words that don’t fit at the end of a line. Always place the hyphen at the end of a proper syllable (like “sta-di-um” rather than “stad-ium”), or use the hyphen in an already hyphenated word as a breaking point (like “multi-millionaire”). If the last word in a line ends with -ing, include the hyphen right before the suffix (like “writ-ing”).
If there’s a double consonant right before the -ing, stick the hyphen in-between the consonants (like “swim-ming”).

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">1. Adjusting Your Appearance
1-1. Take time to decide what type of woman you want to look like.
This greatly influences the other steps. How old are you? What is your body type? What kind of style do you want? Envision the woman you will become. You can be classy, provocative, trendy, or even angelic. What you want to look like will change over time, and outfit choices vary from day to day.
Remember to dress for the occasion and take your daily life into account. If you will be passing as a woman on a regular basis and work in a professional environment, provocative or flashy clothing will not be appropriate. If you’re going out clubbing, wearing more revealing clothes is fine.
If you’re passing as a woman for a party or special event, feel free to go all out. Be over the top in your clothing choices.
Use your close female friends looks for fashion inspiration.
1-2. Jump in the shower to get started.
Showering is the first step in most grooming rituals. So much is done in the shower, including shaving, washing your hair, and getting generally clean. Traditionally, females are known for having smooth skin, clean and shiny hair, and a clean body, so take your time.
Invest in shampoo and conditioner that smell nice and fresh.
Scrub down with a loofah and body wash to exfoliate your skin and leave it clean and smooth.
1-3. Shave your face if you prefer a smooth look.
Use a new razor and take your time. Also, be gentle; you don't want to irritate your skin. Using plenty of shaving cream and razors with three or more blades will keep razor burn to a minimum. If you really want to keep stubble away, you can try waxing, electrolysis, or even permanent laser hair removal, but consult with a professional first.
Buy quality razors to shave with since cheap razors can irritate your skin.
If you'd like, you can shave your entire body, too. You might go through multiple razor blades, so keep extra on hand.
For more sensitive areas like your belly or armpits, avoid using too many strokes. Instead, use a few long, even strokes against the grain of the hair.
Use moisturizer after shaving to soothe freshly shaven skin.
1-4. Pluck your eyebrows to soften your face.
Women generally have thinner eyebrows than men. Remove stray hairs by plucking them firmly from their roots. For highly stylized brows, you may want to seek a professional, but plucking eyebrows can easily be done at home.
The start of your brows should be about one inch above the inner corner of your eye. Remove the strays in between.
The end of your brows should be about one inch above the outer corner of your eye. Pluck any stray hairs that come after this edge.
Pluck hairs from under the brows until a natural arch-shape is achieved. The arch should peak above the outer rim of your eye. Remove stray hairs along the bottom of your eyebrow’s arch. Do this part the slowest, and be sure your brows are parallel in thickness.
It is natural for the skin on your face to become red and sometimes swollen after plucking. This will quickly fade.
1-5. Clean, trim, and manicure your nails.
Though getting clean nails generally happens in the shower but could require you to use a nail cleaner to remove dirt and grime. Use a nail board to file down uneven edges of your nails.
Paint your nails if you desire. Clear polish is always classy, but there is a world of options. If you’re trying to be sassy, pick out a bright red or neon color; if you want a more subtle color, stick with nude shades like beige or silver.
Get a manicure if you have a large amount of hangnails, stubborn grime, or unsightly callouses. A professional manicurist can cut, buff, and paint your nails for you.
1-6. Style your hair.
A simple head of clean hair is all you really need to pass as a woman, but curly, coarse, and long hair require more work. In general, make sure your hair is brushed thoroughly and use styling products if it is overly frizzy or unruly.
Going to a salon can be helpful. A good stylist can tell you not only what's in style but what will look good on you. They can also recommend products for your hair type. Have an idea of what you want, but be open to input as well.
Keep your hairstyles simple unless you’re experienced in working with hair. There are hundreds of articles and YouTube tutorials about easy hairstyles.
Practice different styles well in advanced of any event. There is nothing more stressful than trying a new hairdo on a deadline!
If you’ll be passing as a woman for an extended period of time, grow your hair to the length you desire.
Buying a wig is also a good idea. Wigs come in a variety of cuts, colors, textures, and lengths, so you can find a wig that fits your style.
1-7. Apply your foundation to even out your skin tone.
Foundation helps to cover up any blemishes and will mask a five-o-clock shadow (if that's what you want to do). Find a cover-up and/or liquid foundation that closely matches your skin tone, plus a matching powder to "set" the make-up, making it look naturally feminine.
Visit beauty stores that provide help from makeup professionals to point you in the right direction. This is very important if you’ve never used foundation before. They will let you know what brand works best with your skin and budget.
If you’re shopping online, read the reviews before purchasing foundation. Look into which offer full coverage.
Use a moisturizer and primer before applying the foundation. The rest of your makeup will go on much easier and look better. Use your fingers or an applicator to blend the foundation so there's no clear line between makeup and skin.
1-8. Experiment with makeup looks if you want to.
Decide if you want a full or natural look, but either way, don't overdo it. You don't want to appear clownish. Lipstick, blush, eye-shadow, eyeliner, and mascara are all options for you to use.
If you want a more natural look, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner should suffice.
For a fuller look, apply eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick, too.
The temptation to overdo makeup is common for most beginners. Remember to tailor your makeup to the occasion. Keep it classy, and you'll pass.
Applying makeup is already difficult for women; be patient and ask friends for help. You’ll get the hang of it.
Find YouTube tutorials for complicated looks like a smokey eyes or cat eyeliner.
2. Dressing in Feminine Clothing
2-1. Pick an outfit that makes you feel good about yourself.
Dressing like a woman involves planning your look from head to toe, beginning with your top or dress. The color choice will vary depending on your personal style. If you’re going for a business look, choose more neutral colors, but if you’re going for a night out clubbing, go for bright colors and patterns. Also, choosing a top or dress that flatters your figure is important.
Choose a top or dress that best suits your frame. Plunging necklines draw attention from broad shoulders, so these are often good choices for passing as a woman. Knowing your body and working with it is essential to passing.
If you are more full-figured and have a larger midsection, don’t get a shirt that shows your belly. Fabrics that stretch like polyester can be very comfortable.
If your arms are very bulky, consider using a shawl to cover them when wearing sleeveless outfits.
Corsets, gaffs, breast forms, and other specialized bodyshapers are also available.
2-2. Choose flattering bottoms.
Thinner individuals will have an easier time finding flattering jeans, for example, and a full skirt will accentuate curves nicely. Multiple trips to several stores may be necessary for you to find the right bottoms. Be wary of purchasing pants or skirts online, as sizing can be difficult to predict.
Start with a skirt with empire waist, which is a great choice to begin with. These look good on narrow hips and flatter bottoms.
Go shopping with a female friend to get a second opinion.
Consider learning to tuck and tape if that makes you feel more feminine and empowered.
2-3. Pick out cute accessories.
There are tons of pretty accessories on the market today, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair decorations. Try to tailor accessories to the outfit you’re wearing.
Matching is a good idea. For example, if you’re wearing a green skirt and a white top, put a white flower in your hair or wear a green bracelet.
Don’t wear too many accessories. Wearing three accessories at a time is more than enough.
Jewelry can get expensive, but stores often have more affordable items alongside the more pricey ones.
2-4. Select shoes.
Your shoes should be comfortable but still stylish. Women don't always wear heels, so you don't have to punish your feet. Flats may look better for because men are normally taller than women, so wearing heels could make you tower over others. Once again, think about the occasion. If you’re going to be walking a lot or on your feet all day, heels will not be comfortable.
Heels make your leg muscles tense, so they can make them seem more bulky. This is especially true if your legs are already very toned.
Ballet flats are affordable and come in an array of colors and patterns.
If you do get heels, wearing them around the house can help you become used to walking in them.
2-5. Reflect on your look.
Stand in front of a full-length mirror and turn around so you can see yourself from every angle. Decide if there is any part of your outfit that looks unfashionable or unflattering. If there is, change! Give yourself about an extra half hour to get ready just in case you need to do any last minute changes.
3. Adopting Feminine Behaviors
3-1. Get in touch with your feminine side.
Watching movies and reading books centered on strong female characters will help you understand these traits even better. Remember that overall, women are known for being gentle and caring.
One of the easiest ways to understand feminine traits is to spend time around ladies. Drum up your female friends and set up a book club, wine night, or other weekly time to hang out.
Empathize with others and be sensitive to those around you. Try to be accepting and assertive in a gentle way.
3-2. Work on making graceful movements.
Improve your posture, and realize that feminine gestures, even slight ones, are very important. It is well-known that women often gesture while speaking, which adds femininity and personality to any conversation. Note the gestures and facial expressions of the women around you and try to imitate how they move.
Try to make smaller, more graceful movements as opposed to big steps and heavy gestures. This will help you move with ease.
Standing up straight will also give you poise and will make your body appear more feminine.
3-3. Practice speaking in a higher voice if you'd like to.
Women's voices tend not only to be higher pitched, but also more melodic. Women tend to take on the vocal patterns of those they spend a lot of time with, so find a female friend to emulate.
Be active! The best practice is talking to real people in public situations. This will help your progress, so don’t be shy or embarrassed.
There are also tapes, articles, and the guides available on the web. Spend a few hours on the internet researching practice methods.
If you're not satisfied with your progress, consider seeking out a professional speech therapist.
Tips
If you know a girl who is supportive, you might consider asking her for help. Many girls are more than happy to share advice.
If you want a fuller looking chest, you could experiment with wearing a padded bra.

  "回答明细": "{\"回答\": \"1. Adjusting Your Appearance\\n1-1. Take time to decide what type of woman you want to look like.\\nThis greatly influences the other steps. How old are you? What is your body type? What kind of style do you want? Envision the woman you will become. You can be classy, provocative, trendy, or even angelic. What you want to look like will change over time, and outfit choices vary from day to day.\\nRemember to dress for the occasion and take your daily life into account. If you will be passing as a woman on a regular basis and work in a professional environment, provocative or flashy clothing will not be appropriate. If you’re going out clubbing, wearing more revealing clothes is fine.\\nIf you’re passing as a woman for a party or special event, feel free to go all out. Be over the top in your clothing choices.\\nUse your close female friends looks for fashion inspiration.\\n1-2. Jump in the shower to get started.\\nShowering is the first step in most grooming rituals. So much is done in the shower, including shaving, washing your hair, and getting generally clean. Traditionally, females are known for having smooth skin, clean and shiny hair, and a clean body, so take your time.\\nInvest in shampoo and conditioner that smell nice and fresh.\\nScrub down with a loofah and body wash to exfoliate your skin and leave it clean and smooth.\\n1-3. Shave your face if you prefer a smooth look.\\nUse a new razor and take your time. Also, be gentle; you don't want to irritate your skin. Using plenty of shaving cream and razors with three or more blades will keep razor burn to a minimum. If you really want to keep stubble away, you can try waxing, electrolysis, or even permanent laser hair removal, but consult with a professional first.\\nBuy quality razors to shave with since cheap razors can irritate your skin.\\nIf you'd like, you can shave your entire body, too. You might go through multiple razor blades, so keep extra on hand.\\nFor more sensitive areas like your belly or armpits, avoid using too many strokes. Instead, use a few long, even strokes against the grain of the hair.\\nUse moisturizer after shaving to soothe freshly shaven skin.\\n1-4. Pluck your eyebrows to soften your face.\\nWomen generally have thinner eyebrows than men. Remove stray hairs by plucking them firmly from their roots. For highly stylized brows, you may want to seek a professional, but plucking eyebrows can easily be done at home.\\nThe start of your brows should be about one inch above the inner corner of your eye. Remove the strays in between.\\nThe end of your brows should be about one inch above the outer corner of your eye. Pluck any stray hairs that come after this edge.\\nPluck hairs from under the brows until a natural arch-shape is achieved. The arch should peak above the outer rim of your eye. Remove stray hairs along the bottom of your eyebrow’s arch. Do this part the slowest, and be sure your brows are parallel in thickness.\\nIt is natural for the skin on your face to become red and sometimes swollen after plucking. This will quickly fade.\\n1-5. Clean, trim, and manicure your nails.\\nThough getting clean nails generally happens in the shower but could require you to use a nail cleaner to remove dirt and grime. Use a nail board to file down uneven edges of your nails.\\nPaint your nails if you desire. Clear polish is always classy, but there is a world of options. If you’re trying to be sassy, pick out a bright red or neon color; if you want a more subtle color, stick with nude shades like beige or silver.\\nGet a manicure if you have a large amount of hangnails, stubborn grime, or unsightly callouses. A professional manicurist can cut, buff, and paint your nails for you.\\n1-6. Style your hair.\\nA simple head of clean hair is all you really need to pass as a woman, but curly, coarse, and long hair require more work. In general, make sure your hair is brushed thoroughly and use styling products if it is overly frizzy or unruly.\\nGoing to a salon can be helpful. A good stylist can tell you not only what's in style but what will look good on you. They can also recommend products for your hair type. Have an idea of what you want, but be open to input as well.\\nKeep your hairstyles simple unless you’re experienced in working with hair. There are hundreds of articles and YouTube tutorials about easy hairstyles.\\nPractice different styles well in advanced of any event. There is nothing more stressful than trying a new hairdo on a deadline!\\nIf you’ll be passing as a woman for an extended period of time, grow your hair to the length you desire.\\nBuying a wig is also a good idea. Wigs come in a variety of cuts, colors, textures, and lengths, so you can find a wig that fits your style.\\n1-7. Apply your foundation to even out your skin tone.\\nFoundation helps to cover up any blemishes and will mask a five-o-clock shadow (if that's what you want to do). Find a cover-up and/or liquid foundation that closely matches your skin tone, plus a matching powder to \\\"set\\\" the make-up, making it look naturally feminine.\\nVisit beauty stores that provide help from makeup professionals to point you in the right direction. This is very important if you’ve never used foundation before. They will let you know what brand works best with your skin and budget.\\nIf you’re shopping online, read the reviews before purchasing foundation. Look into which offer full coverage.\\nUse a moisturizer and primer before applying the foundation. The rest of your makeup will go on much easier and look better. Use your fingers or an applicator to blend the foundation so there's no clear line between makeup and skin.\\n1-8. Experiment with makeup looks if you want to.\\nDecide if you want a full or natural look, but either way, don't overdo it. You don't want to appear clownish. Lipstick, blush, eye-shadow, eyeliner, and mascara are all options for you to use.\\nIf you want a more natural look, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner should suffice.\\nFor a fuller look, apply eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick, too.\\nThe temptation to overdo makeup is common for most beginners. Remember to tailor your makeup to the occasion. Keep it classy, and you'll pass.\\nApplying makeup is already difficult for women; be patient and ask friends for help. You’ll get the hang of it.\\nFind YouTube tutorials for complicated looks like a smokey eyes or cat eyeliner.\\n2. Dressing in Feminine Clothing\\n2-1. Pick an outfit that makes you feel good about yourself.\\nDressing like a woman involves planning your look from head to toe, beginning with your top or dress. The color choice will vary depending on your personal style. If you’re going for a business look, choose more neutral colors, but if you’re going for a night out clubbing, go for bright colors and patterns. Also, choosing a top or dress that flatters your figure is important.\\nChoose a top or dress that best suits your frame. Plunging necklines draw attention from broad shoulders, so these are often good choices for passing as a woman. Knowing your body and working with it is essential to passing.\\nIf you are more full-figured and have a larger midsection, don’t get a shirt that shows your belly. Fabrics that stretch like polyester can be very comfortable.\\nIf your arms are very bulky, consider using a shawl to cover them when wearing sleeveless outfits.\\nCorsets, gaffs, breast forms, and other specialized bodyshapers are also available.\\n2-2. Choose flattering bottoms.\\nThinner individuals will have an easier time finding flattering jeans, for example, and a full skirt will accentuate curves nicely. Multiple trips to several stores may be necessary for you to find the right bottoms. Be wary of purchasing pants or skirts online, as sizing can be difficult to predict.\\nStart with a skirt with empire waist, which is a great choice to begin with. These look good on narrow hips and flatter bottoms.\\nGo shopping with a female friend to get a second opinion.\\nConsider learning to tuck and tape if that makes you feel more feminine and empowered.\\n2-3. Pick out cute accessories.\\nThere are tons of pretty accessories on the market today, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair decorations. Try to tailor accessories to the outfit you’re wearing.\\nMatching is a good idea. For example, if you’re wearing a green skirt and a white top, put a white flower in your hair or wear a green bracelet.\\nDon’t wear too many accessories. Wearing three accessories at a time is more than enough.\\nJewelry can get expensive, but stores often have more affordable items alongside the more pricey ones.\\n2-4. Select shoes.\\nYour shoes should be comfortable but still stylish. Women don't always wear heels, so you don't have to punish your feet. Flats may look better for because men are normally taller than women, so wearing heels could make you tower over others. Once again, think about the occasion. If you’re going to be walking a lot or on your feet all day, heels will not be comfortable.\\nHeels make your leg muscles tense, so they can make them seem more bulky. This is especially true if your legs are already very toned.\\nBallet flats are affordable and come in an array of colors and patterns.\\nIf you do get heels, wearing them around the house can help you become used to walking in them.\\n2-5. Reflect on your look.\\nStand in front of a full-length mirror and turn around so you can see yourself from every angle. Decide if there is any part of your outfit that looks unfashionable or unflattering. If there is, change! Give yourself about an extra half hour to get ready just in case you need to do any last minute changes.\\n3. Adopting Feminine Behaviors\\n3-1. Get in touch with your feminine side.\\nWatching movies and reading books centered on strong female characters will help you understand these traits even better. Remember that overall, women are known for being gentle and caring.\\nOne of the easiest ways to understand feminine traits is to spend time around ladies. Drum up your female friends and set up a book club, wine night, or other weekly time to hang out.\\nEmpathize with others and be sensitive to those around you. Try to be accepting and assertive in a gentle way.\\n3-2. Work on making graceful movements.\\nImprove your posture, and realize that feminine gestures, even slight ones, are very important. It is well-known that women often gesture while speaking, which adds femininity and personality to any conversation. Note the gestures and facial expressions of the women around you and try to imitate how they move.\\nTry to make smaller, more graceful movements as opposed to big steps and heavy gestures.

1-1. Understand how model number variations work.
Each iPad has a couple of different variations, typically comprising a Wi-Fi-only version as well as a version that supports both Wi-Fi and cellular data. This is why one iPad type (e.g., an iPad Mini) can have several different model numbers applied to it.
Your iPad's type (according to the model number) does not change the device's physical dimensions (e.g., an iPad Air with cellular is the same size as an equivalent iPad air with Wi-Fi only).
1-2. Remove your iPad's case if it has one.
The model number is located at the bottom of the back of the iPad's housing, so anything covering this area must be removed.
1-3. Locate the model number.
At the very bottom of the iPad's back, you should see a few lines of text; the model number is on the far-right side of the top line of text, right next to "Model".
Your model number will be in A1234 format.
1-4. Match your iPad's model number to the appropriate model.
As of April 2017, all current iPads and their corresponding model numbers are as follows:

 - A1673 (Wi-Fi only); A1674 or A1675 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1584 (Wi-Fi only); A1652 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1566 (Wi-Fi only); A1567 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1474 (Wi-Fi only); A1475 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1476 (Wi-Fi and TD/LTE cellular).
 - A1538 (Wi-Fi only); A1550 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1599 (Wi-Fi only); A1600 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1489 (Wi-Fi only); A1490 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1491 (Wi-Fi and TD/LTE cellular).
 - A1432 (Wi-Fi only); A1454 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1455 (Wi-Fi and MM cellular).
 - A1822 (Wi-Fi only); A1823 (Wi-Fi and cellular).
 - A1458 (Wi-Fi only); A1459 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1460 (Wi-Fi and MM cellular).
 - A1416 (Wi-Fi only); A1430 (Wi-Fi and general cellular); A1403 (Wi-Fi and VZ cellular).
 - A1395 (Wi-Fi only); A1396 (GSM cellular); A1397 (CDMA cellular).
 - A1219 (Wi-Fi only); A1337 (Wi-Fi and 3G cellular).
1-5. Use your iPad's model number to inform hardware decisions.
For example, if you're buying a specific charger or a case for your iPad, knowing the model number will help you determine the size or type of the item.
2. Determining the Software Version
2-1. Open your iPad's Settings.
This is the gray app with gears on it that you'll likely find on the Home Screen.
2-2. Tap General.
You'll see this tab on the left side of the page.
2-3. Tap About.
It's at the top of the "General" page.
2-4. View the "Version" number.
The number to the right of the "Version" tag on this page is your iPad's software version (e.g., 10.3.1). The software version determines the appearance and function of your iPad's programs and features.
Tips
You can find your iPhone's model number the same way as you do for your iPad.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">1. Using Social Media
1-1. Follow companies.
Use services such as Twitter and Facebook to follow companies that you shop at. Occasionally, these companies may hold contests where a certain number of people that “Like” or retweet something receives a complimentary gift card.
1-2. Follow
Twitter and Facebook are full of professional deal-hunters. These people and organizations track down deals and broadcast them to their followers. These deals can sometimes take the form of gift cards.
Search Twitter and Facebook for "deals", "bargains", "deal hunters", "gift cards", etc. There may be deal hunters that specialize in your city, as well as hunters that track specific services such as Amazon.
2. Signing Up for an Online Rewards Program
2-1. Create a new email account
An online rewards program can reward you with gift cards in the long run, but they generate a significant amount of marketing email and spam. This is how they afford to give out gift cards. Create an email address specifically for the rewards program to keep your personal inbox spam-free.
Do not give any of the companies your credit card number, as there are numerous ways to earn points that do not require purchases.
2-2. Sign up for a rewards program.
These programs will send you marketing email with offers that can earn you points. These are often surveys and special purchases through specific retailers. Some of the most popular rewards programs include:
MyPoints
SwagBucks
My Coke Rewards (Discontinued June 30th, 2017)
QuickRewards
PrizeRebel (Alternative to SwagBucks)
Free E-bay Gift Card (Check the last link of source)
2-3. Look for other ways to earn points that don’t directly involve paying money.
These can include playing games, watching advertisements, and filling out surveys. These activities often net you fewer points than purchases, but they are free.
You may need to make big purchases in order to earn enough points for a gift card. Try to make purchases that you would normally make at another store to keep the cost of the gift card down. Making extra purchases just to receive the gift card will defeat the purpose.
Members are usually given the opportunity to sign up with program sponsors for products or services; you do not have to accept in order to become a member or to earn points towards future free gift cards.
3. Using Gather
3-1. Create a Gather account.
This program allows members to earn points by writing articles about topics of their choice, uploading pictures or videos, and by commenting on other member articles.
Topics for articles, pictures, and videos are decided upon entirely by the author. There are numerous groups that members may join to discuss topics with members who have similar interests.
3-2. Write your articles.
The more people that read your articles, the more points you will earn. Write quality articles to help you stand out and draw readers to your work.
Be aware that you will have to put a significant amount of time in writing articles before you see good rewards. You may be better off writing for profit on another website so that you can earn actual money for your work.
3-3. Redeem your points.
Once the designated number of points have been earned, you can redeem their points for free gift cards from a number of businesses, including Amazon.
Gather also offers a direct payment to PayPal, from which members can then purchase gift cards from iTunes or eBay.
4. Signing Up for a Mobile Rewards Program
4-1. Download a mobile rewards app.
These programs are similar to website-based online programs, though are targeted specifically towards mobile users. Some examples include:
MobileRewards
e-Rewards Mobile
JunoWallet
4-2. Earn points by engaging in marketing.
Most mobile rewards programs will ask you to download other apps and games that advertise through the program. There are also often surveys that can be completed.
Be careful when purchasing apps for reward points. Each app may not seem like it costs that much, but a lot of small purchases can add up quickly.
5. Getting Gift Cards Offline
5-1. Donate blood.
Red Cross will occasionally promote blood drives by raffling or giving away gift cards. Contact your local Red Cross and find out if a drive near you is happening soon.
5-2. Test drive a car.
Dealerships will sometimes run promotions that give gift cards when you take a car out for a test drive. Contact dealerships in your area and find out if they are doing any test drive promotions.
Carry yourself like you want to buy. You are much more likely to be allowed to test drive if you act like you’re interested in buying a car. Don’t mention the gift cards up front.
5-3. Transfer your prescriptions to a new pharmacy.
Large chain pharmacies will often offer rewards for transferring your prescriptions to them. These usually come in the form of a $25 gift card for that store.
Tips
Very few programs offer eBay gift cards, however, most do offer direct payment into a PayPal account. The company allows customers to purchase eBay gift cards with funds from their PayPal account for no additional fee.
Never enter your cell number if a survey or service asks for it unless you check their policy. They will take large amounts of money from you at super high rates.
Never enter any personal information as most websites be scams.

It’s a reminder from your guardian angels (or the universe, or God, or whichever power you believe in) to stay optimistic and confident in yourself, because your choices are leading you to a bright future. Trust that the angels have your back and that success, abundance, and prosperity are on the horizon.
Think of 1010 as a sign that you’ll be rewarded for your hard spiritual or personal work. It could be a romantic, financial, or other exciting reward.
2. Spirituality
1010 is a reminder to trust your intuition and listen to higher powers.
Go with your gut when it comes to making big decisions or feeling out a new opportunity. Focus on moving forward and getting out of your comfort zone rather than sticking to your usual ways. Your instinctive feelings are actually the angels communicating with you about your best course of action.
Angel number 1010 asks you to be self-aware and appreciate your feelings of hope, independence, and self-guidance.
3. Love &amp; Relationships
3-1. Seeing 1010 means your relationship will ascend to a higher level.
Things may be getting more serious with your partner, and seeing 1010 is a reminder to listen to your heart and make plans for your future together. Let yourself be more romantic with your partner and express your feelings more freely. The more you open up, the deeper and more lasting your relationship will be.
Seeing 1010 could mean a new phase in your relationship, like getting engaged, moving in together, or having a child together, is on its way.
3-2. Seeing 1010 might mean it’s time for unhealthy relationships to end.
If you see 1010 after an argument with your partner or while reflecting on your unhappiness in a relationship, evaluate whether you really love the person and if the relationship is beneficial to your goals and well being. If it’s not, you may need to break things off in order to move forward and grow as a person.
3-3. For single people, 1010 is a sign that your soulmate is close by.
Stay open to romantic possibilities with unlikely people. Your true love could be a stranger you meet by chance in the coming weeks, or somebody you’ve known for years that you’ve never considered as more than a friend until now. Trust your intuition, and don’t ignore your feelings based on who you’re “supposed” to be attracted to.
1010 is a sign that your true love is near. However, it’s up to you to determine whether that’s the person you’re already with or whether it’s someone new.
Remember, angel numbers don’t operate on a specific schedule. You may meet your new partner the same day as seeing 1010, or not until months later.
4. Twin Flames
Angel number 1010 means you’ll meet or reunite with your twin flame.
If you haven’t connected with your twin flame—the person who mirrors your soul and will help you grow spiritually—then a 1010 sighting could mean you’re already on the path to meeting them. The angels want you to meet, so take 1010 as a strong sign that your union is imminent.
If you’ve been separated from your twin flame (physically or emotionally), 1010 could mean you’re bound to reunite very soon.
You might've met your twin flame without realizing it. Look at your relationships with fresh eyes, and trust your gut if you feel drawn toward anyone.
5. Money &amp; Career
1010 is a number of wealth and abundance when it comes to finances.
The 1 symbolizes new opportunities while the 0 represents limitless possibilities, meaning you’ve got endless options for improving your financial status. Your reward can come in various forms—you could win the lottery or receive an inheritance, or you might finally land your dream job or get a raise.
Seeing 1010 is also a gentle warning to be careful with your money. Budget wisely and be generous with gifts and donations to avoid becoming spoiled.
6. In the Bible
Biblically, 1010 is a sign that God has good plans for you.
In Christianity, 1 is symbolic of new beginnings and 0 stands for infinity or endlessness. Together, they can mean that God will supply you with all the skills and resources you need to overcome challenges. This is especially important in the biblical battle of good versus evil. Even though you may get tempted to sin or feel too weak to carry on, God and the angels will support you no matter what.
When you see 1010, take it as a reminder to live a good life and share positivity to take part in the fight against evil.
Some view 1010 as a symbol of God’s protection against evil forces.
7. Numerology
The number 1010 combines the energies of 1 and 0.
In numerology, 1 symbolizes new beginnings and the motivation for change and creation. It’s a forward-looking number that brings positivity and happiness. The number 0 represents infinity, oneness, wholeness, and divine creative energy.
The number 0 is also a magnifying number that amplifies the energy of the number 1.
When combined, these numbers vibrate with the potential to help you achieve your most important goals and graduate to a higher level of spiritual knowledge.
8. What To Do
8-1. Approach your projects with a good attitude and stay optimistic.
Seeing 1010 is a reminder that the angels are guiding you toward something great, so trust that the future is bright and look forward to it! Tend to your work, goals, and relationships with positivity. Even if something doesn’t go according to plan, consider that it wasn’t meant to be and that you now have space to accept a new opportunity.
Remember, you can’t control what life throws at you. Instead of fearing what comes next, think about the future calmly and stay open minded to new things.
8-2. Get outside of your comfort zone and try new things.
The universe is asking you to stretch yourself a bit when you see 1010. Make an effort to do things that scare you, to meet new people, and to try new hobbies or activities. By embracing the new and unexpected, you open yourself up to making connections and having experiences that will nourish your spirit as you work toward your higher purpose.
Try not to overthink what to do or try next. Just follow your intuition about what seems interesting or exciting and go for it!
Think of every new skill or experience you acquire as a way to learn more about yourself. How did it make you feel? What will you carry with you from it?
8-3. Create concrete plans for how to achieve your goals.
The angels are letting you know you’re on the right track with 1010, but they cannot achieve success for you. Take 1010 as a reminder of your skill and competence, then brainstorm exactly what you need to do to tackle your goals. Look at the big picture and write out the smaller steps you need to take to keep making progress, then hold yourself accountable to your action plan.
Believe in yourself! You have the skills you need to build the life you want, you just have to trust yourself to make it happen and put in the effort.
8-4. Take time to manage your physical and emotional health.
To grow as a person, consider where you’re spending your mental and emotional energy. Let go of negative thoughts, draining relationships, or bad habits that keep you from reaching your potential and believing in yourself. This creates space for spiritual growth, self care, and a deeper understanding of yourself.
Prioritize exercise and a nutritious diet to nourish your body, too. A healthy body can help you feel at peace in your mind and vice versa.
Look for a sustainable balance between your needs and obligations to others. When you care for yourself, you’re better able to care for others, too.
Tips

1-1. The angel number 1133 represents hope and new opportunities.
1133 is a positive number that indicates you’ve got a bright future. You’re likely on the right track in life, and you should continue pursuing your goals. Even if things are a little hectic right now, order and certainty are not far off for you.
If you’ve been dealing with a lot of stress, 1133 is likely a sign that you’re on the brink of finding some peace.
1-2. The angel number 1133 hints at the balance between self and community.
1133 contains two sets of dual numbers. 1 is a representation of self, while 3 symbolizes community and completion. The duality of this pair emphasizes the importance of adhering to your own beliefs while respecting the needs of others.
1133 is dominated by 1 and 3. 1 symbolizes the self, while 3 represents the spirit and community. You may have a new job opportunity coming up, or perhaps you’re about to reconnect with your roots.
1133 may be an indicator that it’s time to consider volunteering in your spare time, or offering help to a friend or family member in need.
Now may be a good time to check in on your friends, or reach out to your support system to see how they’re doing.
2. Angel Number 1133 in Numerology
In numerology, the number 1133 gestures towards the great beyond.
There are 7 days of the week, 7 colors of the rainbow, and 7 musical notes. As you can see, 7 represents completion—but mathematically, 1+1+3+3 = 8. As such, 8 represents the possibility beyond the natural order of the world—the future, the unknowable, the hidden, and the impossible.
The number 1133 also contains two sets of the number 13. In numerology, 13 is a number of fear and foreboding. You have Friday the 13th and the 13 people at Jesus’s Last Supper, for example. Two sets of 13 cancel one another out, so do not worry! Your future is bright, even if it’s scary right now.
3. Angel Number 1133 in Love
3-1. When it comes to romance, 1133 is a reminder to focus on yourself.
The two 1s at the beginning of 1133 emphasize independence and self-reflection. Your romantic life might benefit from a little alone time. Trust yourself, and don’t dedicate too much time looking for true love. It will appear in due time, but only if you’re following your passions and caring for yourself, first.
It’s not that love isn’t coming in your direction, it’s just that you’re more likely to find it by prioritizing your needs. A watched pot never boils, after all!
3-2. If you’re in a relationship, 1133 is a sign that good things are coming.
Your bond with your partner may become deeper in the coming months. If the two of you have been facing a big decision, perhaps you’re about to reach a consensus. The angel number 1133 signifies a healthy and loving relationship, so don’t worry if you’re seeing this omen and you’re in a committed relationship.
4. Angel Number 1133 and Your Twin Flame
The angel number 1133 is a sign to reunite with your twin flame.
Your twin flame is an intense soul connection with your other half. The number 1133 demonstrates that you’re going to be brought back into union with your twin flame soon. The two of you will become one to live a happy, meaningful life full of adventure and love.
If you haven’t met your twin flame yet, 1133 may be a sign that you’re about to meet them for the first time.
5. What to Do When You See Angel Number 1133
5-1. Volunteer to take on a leadership role at work or school.
The angel number 1133 is a sign that you’re about to step into your power as a leader. If you’ve been taking a backseat in your professional life or at school, consider stepping up. You may be rewarded for putting yourself out there and taking the wheel.
5-2. Get back in touch with your spirituality or religious side.
The two 11s emphasize the self, while two 33s represent the divine. The divide between these two numbers may indicate it’s time to check in with whatever higher powers you believe in. Consider getting back into the habit of praying, or attending church again. If you’re not religious, at least be open to new spiritual experiences.
If you feel comfortable with your spiritual or religious life right now, stick with it! Good things are coming.
