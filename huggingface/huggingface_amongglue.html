i'm dr. rafael Darvish with skin packable dermatology and Cosmetic Laser Center here in Los Angeles California and today I'm going to be speaking with you about how to treat back acne quickly acne on the back can be a very annoying problem especially during the summer months when women are wearing open dresses and guys are out by the pool it is very undesired to have acne on the back colloquially it's termed bacne now it's a pretty funny name but it's a very annoying and serious problem for people who have it so firstly what you want to do if you have it is try some benzoyl peroxide cleansers I have one here a 5% benzoyl peroxide that helps to decrease the inflammation so you cleanse your back with this you can also try some glycolic acid cleansers that work very well there are also some topical clindamycin products namely clinda reach that one can use to help to decrease the inflammation very quickly secondly you can go into your doctor's office and he could put small drops of steroid into the most active lesions to kind of get rid of those very noticeable red lesions on the back you can't do it probably to every single one but probably the handful of worst ones can be addressed by some acne steroid injections thirdly if you have a little more time than just a day or two you can try a back chemical peel done in estheticians office and you don't want to forget all the variety of acne treatments out there including oral antibiotics the whole range of topical medicines including the retinoids that help to decrease inflammation and kill bacteria that promote back acne and lastly the most basic of things to keep in mind is shower the area wash it off and maybe take one to two showers a day and wear loose-fitting clothing that's made out of cotton allows it to breathe a little better and will make it make it a little more difficult for the bacteria to live i'm dr. rafael Darvish and that's a brief overview of how to get rid of acne on the back quickly thank you&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1j_YhzvDfQQ&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[MUSIC PLAYING]   As a dental\nprofessional, you know that brushing is not enough. If you just brush, food\ndebris and bacteria get left behind that can lead\nto gum disease and tooth decay. Your patients have to floss. So let's review what we\nknow from your patients about flossing. They don't like it, they\ndon't do it correctly, and they tend to lie about it. In fact, a recent\nAmerican Academy of Periodontology survey\nshows that over a quarter of your patients admit to lying\nabout how often they floss. Let's be honest. In my practice and\nin most practices, the percentage of patients that\nfloss correctly and regularly is very small. I'd have to guess it's less\nthan 25% of my practice. That's a terrible,\nterrible statistic. They'll have stacks and\nstacks of free floss that I've given them for years,\nand they're not using it. But they will use\nthe Water Flosser. The WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser is\nthe modern way to floss. When I'm done, my teeth\nfeel squeaky clean. Water flossing is the\neasy and more effective alternative that can help\nyour patients end the lie. Just how effective is the\nWaterpikÂ® Water Flosser? Let's take a look\nat the research. In a study at the University\nof Southern California, the WaterpikÂ® Water\nFlosser was proven to remove up to 99.9% of plaque\nbiofilm from treated areas. You apply the WaterpikÂ® to\nplaque on a surface of a tooth and you look with a scanning\nscope and it's gone. It's simply gone. And that's unequivocal\nand unarguable. In other studies, the\nWater Flosser was up to 50% more effective at\nreducing gingivitis compared to string floss\nand was up to three times as effective as brushing and\nflossing and up to five times as effective as brushing alone\nfor orthodontic patients. One recent clinical study\nconducted at Tufts University proved the WaterpikÂ® Water\nFlosser is more than twice as effective as string floss for\nreducing gingival bleeding around implants. The Water Flosser is my\ngo-to home care solution for patients with implants. The Plaque SeekerÂ®\nTip, in particular, has been shown to be\nup to two times more effective than traditional\nstring flossing. So that's really important. We need to stay on top of\nperi-implant mucositis. We need to stop it\ndead in its tracks. I don't take any risks\nwith my implant patients. They get Water Flossers. To date, there are over 60\nresearch studies published in peer review journals\ndemonstrating the efficacy of the WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser. Dental professionals are\nmen and women of science. We need to respect\nthe literature and how it guides us towards\nthe most effective treatment for our patients. The WaterpikÂ® Water\nFlosser is time and time again proven to be more\neffective than the alternatives out there. That's why I recommend\nit to my patients. The results are clear. In study after study,\nthe Water Flosser is unquestionably the easier\nand more effective way to floss. But what about Air Floss? In studies published\nin 2012 and 2015, the WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser\nwas compared head to head to SonicareÂ® Air Floss\nand Air Floss Pro. And each time, the\nWater Flosser was proven to be significantly\nmore effective. This demonstration\non an ear of corn helps to show why water\nflossing is so effective. Manual brushing only cleans the\nsurface. An oscillating power toothbrush doesn't do much more. Even a sonic toothbrush can't\nget between the kernels. But the WaterpikÂ® Water\nFlosser thoroughly removes all the\ndebris within seconds. Since every single\npatient of ours gets a WaterpikÂ®\nWater Flosser, I feel like we are slowly steering\nthem on the right path to better oral hygiene\nfor a lifetime, not just when they're in treatment. The research has shown that\nWaterpikÂ® Water Flossing is more effective than\ntraditional string flossing when used in\ncombination with brushing. Significantly more effective. I think a lot of that has\nto do with the technology behind the Water Flosser,\nbut I think it also has a lot to do with compliance. Brushing is not enough. The WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser\nworks, improves compliance, and is clinically proven\nin study after study. The WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser,\nthe easy and more effective way to floss.

guys it's loves to loom here and today I'm going to be showing you how to create this super cute norwood bracelet this bracelet was sent to me by brett his instagram name is the underscore looming underscore center so you may check him out on instagram and give him a follow for me i will have his profile pick up as well i'm here's the front side of the design and it is reversible so you can certainly flip it over and wear it on this super cute side as well to make this bracelet you need approximately 170 bands depending on your wrist size and without further ado let's get started this bracelet you need one loom one c-clip and your hook we only need the two bar pins so you can remove the back row and have them facing in the right the our facing in every direction we want to be working with five pins and that would be one two three four and five so as long as you have a section in the middle between those pins for your bracelet to grow then you will be fine I will be using black turquoise teal and fuchsia today so let's go ahead and get started so I'm going to actually start with laying my teal band and we're just going to lay them going straight out without any twisting so I'll start on my right and then one on my left just like that and now we're going to lay going on the inside we're going to lay two bands which I'm going to start with my fuchsia so one on the left and one on the right so it should look like that it's pretty much making a double you push them down a little bit and now we're going to add on a cap band so it's just a double looped cap in on each pin using usual hook or just do it right here on the pin whichever is easier for you as long as it is wrapped around two times do that on the right pin as well sorry about my hand getting in the way so that's what it should look like so far and now we're going to go ahead and do one of the hooking steps first we're going to loop the middle bands back to themselves so we're going to go inside this left pin here pushing that double cap pin out of the way picking up the fish a band and bringing that forward we're going to do the same on the right side so get inside that double cap in grab the top band and bring it to the middle just like that now we're going to go ahead and loop the outside band so going back inside this left cap in grab your turquoise and bring it forward do the same on the right side push through the cap in grabbing that turquoise and bringing it forward just like that now I'm going to turn my loom around so you can see what I'm doing if it's easier for you you can certainly just reach over and loop it but I want you to see what I'm doing so that's why I'm turning it around we just want to loop these bottom two bands on this middle pin up and over so grabbing these two bands right here you're just going to bring them up and over into the middle just like that turn your loom back around to your errors are facing to the right push all your beans down a little bit and we're going to go ahead and add on our second layer so I am going to start with my turquoise again and we're going to lay our outside bands first one to the right and one to the left and now before we lay our middle bands what we're going to do and we'll do this for the remainder of the bracelet is we're going to bring these two caffeine's up and over now before we lay our middle bands so just starting on the left grab that bottom cap in which should be two bands bring it up and into the middle do the same on the right side grab that cap in and bring it up kind of push those down and now we can go ahead and lay on our middle bands again I'm going to alternate I'm not going to use future the whole time I'm going to go ahead and lay my teal bands so just one to the left and one to the right just like that and now we're going to actually turn - excuse me turn our loom around again because we need to bring those middle bands up and over again before we do anything else so on the middle pin you're going to grab the very two bottom bands and bring them up and over right into the middle like that you can turn your loom back around and now we're going to go ahead and add on our cap band which is going to be black again for me so remember if we just want this wrapped around two times one on the right side and one on the left side just like that and now we're going to go ahead and loop our colors back to themselves so going inside the left cap in we're going to push it out of the way grab the very top band and bring it forward do the same on the right side pushing back the cap in grabbing the top band oh that's not just happen so my cap band just actually popped off for me so I'm going to just quickly fix that if what happens to me just happen to you you can just remove the cap band grab that band pop it back on the pin it's super easy to fit and replace your cap band like so sorry about that so I'm going to go back inside my right cap and just I'm going to hold it grab the top band and bring it forward just like that now we're going to go back inside these cap in so we can loop our turquoise bands so going inside the left grabbing the only band left bringing it up put to the left one now repeat the same on the right side and bring that to the right so it should look like that turn your loom around or reach over whichever is easier for you and now we're going to loop the two bottom bands on each one of these pens so I'm going to start on the right side grab the two bottom bands and bring it up grab the two bottom bands on the middle bring those up and bring the bottom two on the right side just like that so now they're all in the middle turning my loom back around again push them down and we can go ahead and add on our next layer again so again I'm always going to be using my turquoise for my outside bands so I'm laying one to the right and one to the left and remember now we want to bring those cap bands over before we do anything else so starting on the left I'm going to bring that out and I'm doing the same on the right side just like that pushing it down just a little bit and now we're going to add on our metal band so I'm going back to my fuchsia and it doesn't really matter if you lay the left first or the right I would just stay consistent so you don't you know mess up consistency is what keeps usually everyone on track so now that we've done that we do need to loop the bands on back here up and over before we do anything else so once again you can either reach back here and pull them over or turn your loom around so I'm going to grab the two bottom bands just on the middle and bring them up turning my loom back around we're going to now add our copying going again making sure they're double looped and then my hand gets in the way when I do my cat beans it always does so I'm sorry but that's all I did was added my toque a pins on and now I'm just going to loop the middle back to themselves and then the out ones back out so I'm going to push my left cap in out of the way grab that top and carefully making sure not to lose the cap band enter the same on the right side grab that very top band and pull it forward now we're going to do our turquoise or outside bands bringing them back to themselves as well just like that turn your loom around now we're going to bring the bottom two up and over again on each pin starting from the left now in the middle bringing those two bands up and on the right side just like that turn your loom back around with the air is facing to the right push your bands down and we're going to do that all over again so I definitely feel like just like any bracelet once you start doing it a few times it definitely definitely is pretty simple to pick up on it's just remembering to keep bringing those bands over so I did lay my two outside bands so now we have to bring the cap pin up and over just like that and now we can go ahead and add our metal bands since I'm alternating I'm going back to my teal for me this was the most trickiest part because I kept forgetting to want to bring those bottoms up so now this is where you want to reach back here return your loom around I'm just going to reach this time grab the two bottom bands on that middle pin here and bring them up and over just like that and it's time to add our cap bands on again so double-loop those cat bands just like that and now we can go ahead and bring them back to the middle rubbing the top and now doing the right side and now going back in the cap bands and bringing the outsides out just like that I'm going to turn my limb around and bring the two bottom bands up and over once again on all three of these pens just like that turn it back around with the air is facing to the right push your bracelet down and we'll repeat that again so I'm just going to keep doing it a few times without repeating this steps just follow along in case you haven't picked up the steps already okay so I feel like I've done it enough times till you guys could definitely pick up on the pattern and I wanted to show you how it's growing at the bottom so you definitely want to just come down here give it a nice tug you can start seeing that awesome design forming I absolutely love how this turns out with the little like - looking things on the side and how it comes together in the middle and the back looks super cool as well so anyway I am going to go off-camera to finish up the length of my bracelet if you have any troubles please watch the previous instructions and I will come back at the end and show you how to close it up together I'll be right back alrighty guys so I did go ahead and finish up the length of my bracelet so now we can go ahead and get it closed up together just make sure that you did the very less last step that you would do before restarting that process all over again so you're lifted look like this you should have your two captains in the front which would be two bands so the two caffeine's here and then in the back they should all be looped so there should be two bands on each of these three pins so it should look just like that and if it looks like that we can go ahead and get a close job the first thing that we are going to do is bring these two outside bands into the front here so I'm just going to start on my right side lifting these two bands off of this top right pin and we're just going to carefully remove them and bring them forward like that doing the same thing on the left side grabbing these two and bringing them forward just like that so now we are down to three pins we're going to take one band I'm going to use the same color that I was using for my cap bands and we're just going to wrap it around all three of these pins right here so just one single band stretched around all three of these we're going to now bring the bottoms up and over on each of the pins so I'm going to start in the back bring that forward we have four bands on the front two because we have that cap band on the bottom if you cannot grab all four you can certainly describe to at a time I like to grab the top two first and then bring those over and then grab the bottom two bring those over doing the same on the right side as well so now you should be left with one single band on all three of these pins and now we're just going to bring these top or bottom to up to this top one it doesn't matter which side you start on first just be careful not to lose any of your bands I'm going to turn my loom around and this is where we are going to attach our c-clip there's the total of three bands on this pin here so just slide your hook down in there and I recommend doing this part on the loom it's just a little bit easier for this design slide you see clip one and pop it off the loom just like that and this bracelet I meant to tell you does curl up but it wears very nice when you have it on so just give your bracelet a nice little stretch I think it's a super cute look in here it is before I clip it so it is reversible and I did have a band break I've never had that happen to her to her before but I fixed it so it's barely noticeable but yeah so come down here to the other side and I just grab these two bands right here at the very end and clip it on like so and there you have D complete it Norwood bracelet just zoom out here a little bit there we go so there you have the completed Norwood bracelet I love this design I'm super glad Bret was kind enough to let me do this tutorial again as I just stated this is the design created by Brett also on instagram as the or the or SCOR looming underscore center so definitely credits to him for this awesome design give him a follow for me and hopefully

welcome Marlin here today we're making some undecorated pokeball cook stay tuned for the step-by-step tutorial here is some bread cookie dough rolled with the thin rolling dice saran wrap and I'm cutting some rounds here you can just quickly go through them now once you've done that you can easily remove the outer dough which you can re-roll and now you can pick this up do not touch the cookies until they are frozen so they don't move here is the white dough roll to the thinnest thickness and I'm using and I'm using my cookie cutter here with saran wrap to bevel the edges just like we did the red and I'm just running through them I need eight there we go and now I need also this small shape this is the accent cookie for the both of all and now I can remove my excess dough and pop these in the freezer alright I'm ready to cut the base cookie I'm using the cutter just the next size up and I'm cutting nine out so that I can assemble the cookies together now if you had all these chances are you'll make the round not exactly round for you better that pick them up put them in the freezer before you touch them I have all my pieces here and I'm going to show you how to quickly assemble this stack your two white and red cookies together now we're going to take a big cutter and we're cutting right through the two of them and cutting again to get like that band around the edge of the cocoa ball now I'm taking the circle to cut this oh now this is pretty much all disposed of we don't use that now we put these halves on the chocolate base and then we put the little chocolate circle there and now I'm adding the white just above like so and like so there we go we can just give that a press to adhere it to the surface of the cookie and there we have our cookies coming along you can already see the design as you work on the cookies they obviously melt and so don't handle them when they're getting soft because they will warp so right now they're on the cookie sheet so they're pretty safe and I'm just adding those little rounds that I did in white to the center here of our chocolate cookie just give it a little press like so my focal ball cookies are almost done and I'm just adding now a little bit of chocolate cookie dough right in that little gap and I'm rolling hand rolling some chocolate dough and I'm just placing that in in that opening and that's it you see there that was pretty easy I am quite pleased I think they look pretty authentic and really you don't require any skill to do this if you can roll out cookie dough you can do this so thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the video please subscribe and I'll see you next time

folks that Roylott v-twins to be AIDS I'm back on the pink project so just just to give you where we're at I primed all my pieces guide coded even block them all out two times so I got really nice surfaces to put my paint job down at Walmart so I'm preparing now to get ready for my exterior paint job but I do have the inside tunnel of the tank in the inside of my fender that I want to take care of same with my rear fenders over here out of the line of the camera so what I've done is they it's already been primed with some anti corrosive primer I took a red scuff pad like this I scuff pad at the inside I do have the area in here where where I had welded the brackets of a fender so I'm going to put a little seam sealer in there and then these pieces I'm going to put some tape and some paper on the outside of them and I'm just gonna flat block the inside of this because my paint job is gonna be black but I just want to have this be clean I don't really want to get into spending a whole lot of time putting down base coat clear coat and everything on the inside of a fender that nobody's ever gonna see it just never really made any sense to me but I am gonna tape it off and I'm gonna trim block it so it's got a nice you know semi-gloss kind of blacked look on the inside same with the inside of my tunnel so I'm gonna tape this off I'm gonna get that stuff primed up and then after that setup I'll get things get my garage prep I'll get my my jigs in here and everything I'll get my defenders and tank mounted and get ready for paint at that point I'll come back on and I'll show you what I've done where I'm at and then we'll I will put the black base coat down okay folks so here I am with my parts what I did was I sprayed the inside of these pieces with some trim black it just gives it a satin black finish it's nice and quick and easy cleans everything up I'm gonna paint my gloss black on the outside this will be not really visible but when you look under there and it'll look very acceptable I'm gonna grab the camera I'll show you what's going on yeah this is my Connell and everything here this is the inside of my fender you can see here where I am where I spread my seam sealer where I did my welding just kind of cleans the air this is my back fender here you can see I just kind of blacked out the inside of it but now that I have that done I'll let this dry pretty good I'm gonna prep my garage and get my get ready to put all of these items that I'm gonna paint on on fixtures on stands so that I get it painted well once I have that set I'll come back and go through the whole paint process with you we'll get some base coat on these today okay so I'm back I've got my my garage has been blown out it's all I wet the floor down on all the edges of the walls and nooks and crannies and everything with a hose seal the dust down I took my bench here I covered it with masking paper on my fixtures that I have my fenders on a couple of those with masking paper I've taken my fenders and got him wall-mounted and everything what I did just for a last-minute precaution was I took a red scuff pad and I went quickly over my fenders next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some compressed air mate in the air hose and I'm gonna blow all of my fixture my fenders all the little nooks and crannies make sure that that blow out all the dust or maybe even a little bit of water or something that might have been in there and I what's Anthon I'm things of that nature so I'll get that all squared away then I will do wash it with some pretty cleaner and at that point I'll be pretty much ready to go I'll get my gun all set my pink ball set and then we'll put some base to this tape folks so I get everything blowing off I washed everything with pre cleanup looked it over really good I'm good to go so I've got my garage all set what closed up lights are on I'm going to turn the exhaust fan on I've got my gun set up I got my face coat I'll show you everything and give me a little close-up of what I got going on here okay so here's my tank I got it set up on this jig and I've done this in the past it just kind of works so good I put it on this 2x4 and then I attach it with screws on one end I just let it sit on the other end what I can actually do here is I can take this tank and I can flip it like this so I can actually get my bottom side really good if I want to okay and then I can flip it back like that so it's like that so kind seesaws back and forth so I've got that set up over here I've got my Fender on my jig that I have made here and I got my other fender on this jig I got my my spray gun and I got my base coat so I've mixed up my base coat this is uh this is Sherwin Williams dimension the mixin mixing ratio is two parts of the base one part of the reducer I'm going to put down two to three medium coats on the on the surface I'm going to tap these pieces off I'm gonna get my fan gun and get my paint strained into the gun and I want to put a coat of base on here now the idea is not to try and cope not to cover your piece in one color okay we've just put an even coat on it you've got to be able to see through it don't don't panic look down on you don't want this to flash depending upon your environment I mean worried about seventy-five eighty degrees here which is pretty much perfect I'll let it flash for probably ten to fifteen minutes you'll notice it a little matte flat finish once you get that you know just keep an eye on when you finish your cup when you've finished your the last of your application wait 10 15 minutes put another coat on three coats you should be covered once you are done or you think you're done with your third coat what I would recommend is like that flash go around look at all of your edges bottom sides undersides everywhere to make sure you don't have any areas that don't have enough paint because once you put the clear on it you're done otherwise you start the whole process all over again so five or ten minutes so check for any areas that are covered take your gun just dust in those areas it's going to make a big difference because it's happened to every painter you paint something also you got a little or something after it's all said and done because he didn't hit it in a certain angle and now you know what is sitting it doesn't have enough paint on it and you're screwed you gotta sand the whole thing down and paint it again so don't get caught with that make sure you check your edges I'm going to apply this base coat and I'll come back on afterwards and it will talk about clear coat&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ga54lTAu9Fw&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;am

yes you read that right anybody can highlight motorcycle cylinder fins at home so what you see on the screen is my first attempt and you can see it looks pretty good actually almost factory finish so you can achieve this at home with some basic tools some patience and a little bit of talent okay so if you want to know how to get this done stick around all the details so if you want to achieve some decent professional results you really need to tear the engine down to do this properly so we did this to my brother Sportster when we were planning to upgrade the engine anyway so it needed to be reborn from 883 to 1200 cc so it was a good point to do this so I tore the engine down and then I could clean all of the components and basically get to everything quite easily as usually with me I have an idea and then I have to work on reverse engineering and planning and testing on how I get there so my first plan here was to grind the fins down with a grindstone but that didn't really work because the grindstone just specially kept on skipping across the surface and leaving a horrible marred finish so that was a no-no so I then moved on to trying a sanding block and a small flat wheel but the flat wheel also didn't work as well because it left a textured chatot finish because it was also bouncing across the surface and eventually out of desperation that's how you discover this stuff I went out and I bought a powerful a small cheap tool that has a small sanding belt that you can change the grid sizes on the belt so you can start of course and then go slowly increasing the grid size to get a smoother finish so that's how I then started sanding these and this the the profile was perfect for the job because I could get into all the small nooks and crannies you can see you they before and after and the idea was to send the fins first then get the cylinders steam blasted not sandblasted but scheme lasted and then paint them okay so that's what you'll see in the next couple of pictures here I'm disassembling the valves getting all of that out because the heads of course need to be blasted you don't want to leave these the valves in and you can see they're powerful did a good job these are the cylinders after they'd been blasted again seeing it perfectly clean now no corrosion left [Music] next step is to prepare the environment we're gonna paint and mask everything off but I actually do not recommend that you use duct tape like I did use high temperature masking tape because that tape actually lose itself on in the oven and but hey you gotta find out so Maho so but you can buy specialist high temperature masking tape for this sort of stuff and it's not too expensive so it's all masked off here and [Music] last up is two degrees everything with a degreaser from a paint shop products store and then I painted these with techline coatings T Ltd thermal dispersant paint there's not just your general cylinder paint it actually disperses heat so you've got to be really careful what you put on these especially the cylinder heads because you don't will just want to stop the cylinders from transferring heat to the environment you want to actually help them to transfer the heat away so that's why I chose that pain yes it was expensive and yes it needs to be baked in an oven at 150 degrees C but it is a great paint and it helps us the little shell heat so you can see here that of course I have painted over in the area that approves he sends it hot that was one purpose because the first sending was basically to get it ready and then now you just had to give it a light sanding to get back to the shiny surface you'll also see that the duct tape actually baked itself onto the cylinders which is what I don't recommend that you use it and so yeah use high temperature masking tape for the stuff you can see the finishes excellent now you can do this at home let's say it's quite easy to do next up clamp them in between some wooden blocks and then send them very lightly again with the powerful but and I mean very lightly just enough to get the paint of the previously highlighted fins and you can see it's already looks awesome and that finish has really held up extremely well over the years it hasn't corroded again and you can see it looks absolutely amazing that's a factory finish and you can achieve that at home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so what I'm doing here is I'm cleaning the cylinders and heads with soapy water warm soapy water yes you heard that right soapy water and then you once he done you blow them out with compressed air dry them and oil them so they put on rusticles and but that's what you need to do to get all the metal shavings out of there because you do not want those in your engine okay and that's the only way to really get all the crap out is with warm soapy water and decreasing and once it's all nice and clean and dry and the bores oiled so that they don't rust with their cast iron then I started reassembling everything and I put new valve stem seals in I used a valve seal driver to put some tape around the valves so that I don't damage the new seals because I may have sharp lips and then you put everything back together [Music] yeah I'm capping the new piston rings after the internet been bored out those are the new wise Co Pistons going in to bring it up to 1200 cc and here's the finished result doesn't it look awesome see you can achieve this at home just need a bit of patience and a bit of bravery to do this all right so thanks for watching thanks for supporting

skin and acne on my face shoulders and even my back for many years I tried everything I could get my hands on I saw three different dermatologists each who prescribed a different wonder drug that never worked in the long run I was fed up after years of suffering and trying all the conventional acne treatments I knew it was time to try something radical so I started extensive research into holistic medicine alternative medicine and natural healing I consulted a handful of natural fats Chinese healers nutritionists and other natural health professionals I read every book I could get my hands on I was like an acne fighting information sponge I have to tell you some of what I discovered blew me away I implemented these newly discovered techniques right away and saw an instant difference in my skin my acne was virtually gone from every part of my body so I went out and enlisted all my friends and family who had added me to try my natural acne fighting techniques the results across a wide range of acne suffers from mild to severe from ages 13 to 42 the feedback was astonishing 87% of the people who honestly implemented my holistic based system so there was not only a dramatic reduction of their acne but claimed overall better skin health as well based upon my years of research of all the secrets I'd learned&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;7nBXRFZ67FA&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hey guys, itâ€™s Ro, welcome to another Nerdy\nNummies! It is summer time and it is really heating\nup here in California so I thought, letâ€™s make a chilled Geeky Treat\ntoday, so today we are gonna be making some homemade Game Boy Ice Cream\nSandwiches, letâ€™s get started! If you would like to make these super easy\nmode, you can just buy the pre-made Ice Cream rectangle sandwiches that you find\nat the grocery store. But Iâ€™m gonna be making mine from scratch,\nso that I can make them a little bit bigger, to look like the actual\nGame Boy size. But, if youâ€™re in a hurry and you want to\nmake some cold treats for summertime, you can just buy the pre-made ice cream sandwiches. So the things you will need to make these\nfrom scratch, will be: 2-2/3 Cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, 2 eggs, 2-1/2\nsticks of unsalted butter, 3/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of\nsalt, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Youâ€™ll also need a cookie\nsheet and a piece of fitted parchment paper, and Iâ€™ve got a little lollipop\nstick. For the middle of the sandwich youâ€™ll need\nsome ice cream, here Iâ€™ve got classic vanilla ice cream, but you can use\nwhatever ice cream flavor is your favorite. Then to decorate weâ€™re gonna\nneed green and black candy melts, and some M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s. You will also need a big\nmixing bowl and a small mixing bowl, sifter, whisk, a flipper-flapperâ€¦. This\nis called a spatula. And an electric mixer, now letâ€™s put it\nall together! The first thing that weâ€™re gonna be doing\nis scooping our ice cream into a cookie sheet, but weâ€™re first gonna line\nour cookie sheet with a piece of wax paper, ooop! If you donâ€™t have a cookie sheet, you can\njust use a glass pan, anything that youâ€™d like. I like the cookie sheet\nbecause it is about an inch tall. And that is how tall exactly I want my little\nIce Cream Sandwich filling to be. And now weâ€™re gonna scoop, scoop, scoop! Come on now! Come on now! Come on! Oh my gosh heâ€™s frozen on there! Now that weâ€™ve got all of our ice cream\nin the pan, youâ€™re gonna take a spoon, and smooth it over. Bewm! Now youâ€™re gonna pop this in the freezer\nto re-freeze, for about an hour or two. And while itâ€™s re-freezing, we are gonna\nmake our cookies! The first thing that weâ€™re gonna do to make\nthese cookies is: In a small bowl we are gonna sift our flour and cocoa powder.\nNow weâ€™re gonna whisk them together and set this off to the side. Next, in a medium bowl, we are gonna cream\ntogether our butter, sugar and salt. I like to add my butter first, and then mix\nit together until itâ€™s smooth, and then youâ€™re gonna mix in your sugar and\nsalt until itâ€™s evenly combined. Now that we got those all mixed up we are\ngonna add 2 egg yolks, remember just the yellow part into our mixture. And then youâ€™re gonna add your vanilla extract,\nooooh! And then mix it up one more time until everything\nis evenly combined. Now we have our butter mixture and our dry\nmixture, and we are going to combine them, Iâ€™m going to add the dry mixture to\nthe butter mixture in thirds, and mix them up in-between until they are evenly combined. Got our cookie dough all mixed up and I just\nput it on top of my counter. And I lightly covered the surface with flour\nso that the cooke dough doesnâ€™t stick. And if itâ€™s a little bit crumbly, thatâ€™s\nOK! This is a drier recipe, I love this drier cookie recipe because it compliments\nthe ice cream so well! Itâ€™s really good! So donâ€™t worry about the little crumblesâ€¦\nYou just squish it together! Now Iâ€™m just gonna pack it down with my hands\nto be somewhat flat, and then grab a rolling pin, and smooth it out! Just rolled out our dough and now weâ€™re\ngonna cut out our little rectangle cookies. Cut as many as youâ€™d like. Just remember\nyouâ€™ll need 2 cookies to complete your ice cream sandwich. Remove the excess dough around your cookies\nand then scoop them onto your baking sheet. Got all of our cookies on the sheet and now\nfor that classic Ice Cream Sandwich look, weâ€™re gonna poke little holes on the\ntop. I like to start with three holes, and then\ntwo, and then three, and then two and then three and then two and then three! While the cookies are baking (at 350 Degrees\nfor 14 Minutes), we are gonna make some decorations. We are going to make the screen on the little\nGame Boy and some buttons. Bewp! While the cookies are baking, we are gonna\nmake some decorations. I printed out these two templates, and Iâ€™ll\nput a link down below if youâ€™d like to use these, or you can make your own,\nwhatever youâ€™d like. Take a little tape, tape â€˜em down to the\nsurface, then youâ€™re gonna take this piece of wax paper and place it\non top, now we are going to trace and fill in our little designs with our melted\ncandy. In this plastic bag I melted the black candy\nmelts, and I put a number two tip at the top for a little bit more control,\nand then Iâ€™m gonna use it to trace and fill in these little Dpads. Now we got our Dpads done, and now we are gonna\nuse the green candy melts to make our screens. Once your cookies have finished baking and\ntheyâ€™ve had plenty of time to cool, now we are going to decorate, my favorite\npart! So over here I just took a few of the cookies,\nthese are gonna be the tops of the Ice Cream Sandwiches. And we are going\nto attach our little screens and Dpads, and then our mini M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s, weâ€™re\ngonna be using two little red M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s for the buttons. To attach the little details Iâ€™m gonna be\nusing some of the extra dark candy melts in this little plastic baggie,\nas adhesive. So youâ€™re just gonna take one of these little\nguys, bewp! And on the back put a little dab of your candy\nmelt, and then place it on top of your ice cream sandwich. Then weâ€™re gonna attach a little Dpad and\nwe got our mini M&amp;amp;Ms, for the little buttons. Then youâ€™re gonna do this to the rest of\nyour cookies! Our cookies are assembled and now I just took\nout the tray of frozen Ice Cream, And now youâ€™re gonna take your rectangle\ncookie cutter, and we're gonna cut out the middle of our ice cream sandwiches,\nand this doesnâ€™t have a really soft, grippy top, so Iâ€™m gonna be using\nmy mitt, so it doesnâ€™t hurt your hands, and then you gotta put some pressure on the\ntop. Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee! This is called the jumping technique Then you pull it out, perfect, just like that! Then youâ€™re gonna place it onto a little\ncutting board over here. Youâ€™re gonna cut out as many as you can\nin the Ice Cream tray, and then pop these back in the freezer so that theyâ€™ll\nhold their shape and we will assemble our cookies! Ta-da! Here are the Game Boy Home-Made Ice Cream\nSandwiches that we made today! I hope you guys enjoyed them, I love them,\ntheyâ€™re just like little, retro-geeky, summer treats to keep you cool! Iâ€™ll be posting lots of pictures on Facebook,\nTumblr, Instagram and Twitter! And if you guys make these or any other Geeky\nIce Cream Sandwiches, please take a photo and send it to me, I just love seeing\nyour baking creations. I just get a big kick out of it, it makes\nmy day. And, if you have any other ideas for any other\nNerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down\nbelow and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright thanks again you guys,

the flour and add in the sugar cut the butter into small pieces and add to the mixture mix with your hands until the mixture forms a ball of dough if your dough is too dry you can add a tablespoon of milk mix until you get the dough of this consistency cut the dough in half and flatten one of the halves add the cocoa powder on top and mix until the powder is well incorporated then cut both pieces of dough in half to get four parts take one piece of dough that does not contain cocoa powder and knead into a rectangle once you create a rectangle cut it in half repeat this step with a piece of cocoa dough overlap the for rectangular tubes like this such that you alternate between different types of dough this is the nice shape you should get place in the refrigerator for a while next flatten the second cocoa piece it has to be as square as possible do the same with the plain dough then overlap them like this pressing them together to make sure they stick well then roll them together place in the fridge until the dough hardens a little and can be cut while maintaining its shape cut the squares like this cut the circles like that pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit bake for 15 to 20 minutes watch them closely to make sure they don't burn to keep your cookies fresh put them in an airtight container you&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;xA4lO1EpjL8&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hey guys so today I'll be showing you how to make this really cute cherry blossom without the rainbow loom and I made my pink because that's usually the color of cherry blossoms but if you want of course you can change up the color you think this charm is unique because when you look at it um the petals kind of look like hearts so to make this term you will need 15 of your petal color and a single green rubber band for the stem and then right here I have my hook for my rainbow loom you can use a crochet hook begin by taking your hook and one single pink rubber band or your petal color and twist it around your hook so that there are three loops and you can count one two and three and then you want to take two of your petal color and place it on the hook and you want to slide the little set of loops we made onto there and move it to the middle and then with your finger let go and we're actually going to take this off the hook just for a second and you want to hold it like this and look at which ones on the top so the rubber band that's on the top you want to place one side of it onto the hook like that you see this side is not on the hook yet and then you take this side right here where there are two that aren't on the hook and you want to place both of them onto the hook and then you want to stretch this side back onto the hook so this will create your petal once you have five of them and I'll go through this process once again so take one single rubber band and wrap it around your hook so that there are three loops one two and three and then take two rubber bands at a time place it onto your hook and slide the set of loops onto those rubber bands and then actually let go with your finger and take it your little hook here and then find the rubber band that's on the top on the right side and then place it onto your hook and then put the open end right here both of them on to your hook and then find the loose end right here and place it onto the hook just like that so create I have five of them I'm ready to put this on and if you don't have five yet go ahead and pause the video or if you don't get it re watch the earlier part on how to make each petal so once you have five take a single green rubber band and place it on your hook and you're going to slide each petal on to the green part and the easiest way to do this is just take the end where there's that set of loops and just slide it like that slide it it's pretty easy you want to be careful because it might get caught up in the little hook area but just try to stretch it out as much as possible and you should get all of them on there and now push this side down so that you can put the open end on your hook you can adjust the flower a bit if you'd like and then basically just go from the bottom here and bring it over the top and it creates a slip knot and then once you have that slip knot you can remove it off your hook and adjust so that's it adjust anything you may need and thanks for watching and please

you want to Plasti dip your rims. Me Too. Let's begin So the First thing you'll want to do is clean\nthe dog piss out of your rims. Literally, and metaphorically. Dry the rim thoroughly with a clean rag. Tape off your bearings with transparent tape,\nand block the threads that mount your brake disks. I was able to stuff it with random paper &amp;amp; plastic\nthat was laying around the garage cause after all, I am a professional. After you've prepped both sides, it's time\nto get to spraying. Make sure you're in a well lit, ventilated\narea, where the rim has no contact with the sun. The last thing you want is some asshole star\nfrom 93 million miles away to fuck up your paint job. After shaking the can vigorously for a full\nminute like it just told you your bike was slow, you're going to want to give it a test\nspray on a piece of cardboard, paper, your cat, or your test piece of choice. For the first coat you want to start off with\na light coat of about a 50%-60% coverage. Much like spray painting, this thin layer\nwill help create a much better bond than if you were to disperse a full coat. Be sure to spray in short bursts, and always\nmove the can while spraying. After you let the first coat dry for about\n30 min. Spray the second coat at about 95%-100% coverage. The main goal here is to apply the coat evenly\nacross the entire wheel. Allow another 30 min to dry. Based on your particular Plasti Dip project\nthe can may have enough for a fourth coat. Although I could've sprayed a fourth layer,\nI decided to empty the can for the third coat for a thicker layer. Finally, to achieve an attractive shine to\nmatch my bald head, and provide protection form the elements, I added 1 coat of Plasti\nDip Enhancer Glossifier. After about an hour, remove the excess Plasti\nDip from your tire. Contrary to what I've done here, I suggest\nusing painters tape for the chicken strips during preparation. If you choose not to, you can use something\nlike brake cleaner to remove the Plasti Dip that's too thin to peel off. Finally, take the time to pat yourself on\nthe back, admire your work, &amp;amp; Let it cure for about 8 hours before you install the tire. Alright guys so I think it came out looking\npretty fan fuckin tastic. I hope you guys got some kind of value out\nof the video. If you did spread some love, like, ask some\nquestions, I'll respond. And, if you wanna see pictures I'm gonna post\nsome pictures on my instagram probably by tomorrow when I actually get it on the bike. But, yeah. Thank you guys for watching, and we'll catch\nyou guys later. Peace Alright guys that's... Alright guys, I hope you guys hahaha\nIf you guys did enjoy the video be sure to like comment subscribe god damnit. Hahahaha, oh shit.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;HND7Ekp8fnM&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hi everyone it's on you from Vanilla's welcome to my youtube channel today i'm going to show you really fun dessert playstation controller buttons bedded force for this dessert you're going to need few recipes i posted all of the recipes and all the links for the tools that I used in this video down below in the description area first thing I would recommend that you make the filling i'm using german buttercream you can find a link down below and i also made very basic sponge cake I baked it in a large gelly roll pen and it's still a little warm so I'm just gonna invert it on a wax paper sprayed with some nonstick spray and you can just let it be and let it cool then once the sponge cake is cooled you can flip it over and just peel off the wax paper and you can just throw it out and using a small round cutter I'm using 2 inch cutter just cut out as many rounds as you can and then you can fit your piping bag with a star tip or a round tip it doesn't really matter and then fill the bag with a German chocolate buttercream and now we're going to fill these cakes with buttercream once you fill all of these little cakes you're going to have to put it in a fridge until the buttercream hardens so while that's happening we can prepare the fondant decorations using the same color that i use for to cut out little cakes cut out the rounds and then roll out a piece of fondant little thicker than larger rounds and cut out these tiny little circles i used this is an X and cutter you can find a link to where to get these down below in the description area alright so once you have them all cut out you just want to take small brush and just moisten it very very lightly and just run it along the edges you don't want to saturate the brasserie water because then the water is going to start dissolving the Fond and you just want a little moisture so these small rounds are gonna stick there if you need it you can trim off any kind of fun that it is stretched and now that the cakes are chilled and we have the fondant decorations ready we can prepare the ganache so I'm going to heat up some heavy cream until you see there are little bubbles so it's ready and just put it over the chocolate what I like to do I like to put a piece of paper towel on top and then let it sit and then using a whisk you can just whisk this until you have a nice shiny ganache so now you can either pour the ganache over the cakes or what I'm gonna do here I'm just going to dip it dip each cake in a ganache I'm not really worried too much about the look of the top of the cakes because we'll be putting the decorations on top but you can definitely pour this on if you'd like to and now while the ganache is still wet we can just take the decoration and put it onto up and then you just want to wait until ganache said you can also put this in the fridge and wait until the ganache set and then we can finish this off I'm going to be using royal icing for for the buttons so I colored it with some pink blue red and also some green so we're going to do triangle circle X and square and as I mentioned before you can make this ahead of time I've made them i think it was three days before we had them so and i just had them in the fridge and they were absolutely excellent so i hope you like this tutorial don't forget to give it a thumbs up subscribe and you'll get all the video updates delivered to you via email thanks for watching&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;HnTLh99gcxY&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;previously on customer mods they've had too faded damage paint from motorcycle so you've tasted the whole thing put some primer on it now is in the spray booth pretty good and custom paint job all right so I decided to paint my whole bike the track race bearings and everything not just the tank in the and the plastic parts so I'm going to paint it in a flurry color which was suggested by someone on my last video and I picked the color scheme from the n GM Ford Racing team colors I'm a big fan of MotoGP so I thought I'll give this color scheme ago and yeah I'm uh prepared now clean the oil with wax and grease remover I'm about to spray some 2k transparent sealer on it which is going to help the new paint stick and then I'll be ready to start my color scheme so let's do it the 2k Cielo is like a niche promoter but a lot better quality to that I like to put that down especially when I'm asking outlines that helps the paint stick a lot that up we've got a lot of black in this colors game bring this bright black down to us to pull the pots then I'll be ready to start mopping up my best time data people well they're all the file tents okay so just master that all about lines now I'm going to do my first color but first we're going to spray white down one down first because the fluo colours really need to go over a white base to get the fire reflective book so instead of just playing it over black I'm going to kind of white and I'm then British my bluest now I'm using the spray cheap fluorescent colors spray cheap is an Australian company it's made in Australia and they provide quality custom paints including candies curls and many other custom tanks and yes good start okay so now I'm masking up my lines for the next color I've done the orange or red actually thread for yours something watches something a letter color scheme now hopefully it all works out an excuse okay so most of what I won Lansford what and already carried one through dude zero colors by spreadsheet our bass player it's a clearer debate color so I'm going to spray the bass down first then let that dry for about ten to fifteen minutes then I'll spray a clear coat on top okay now I'm going to spray a two-pack satin tweeter it's going to be about 50 cent gloss so it's not going to be full gloss but it's still going to do the 2-pack detection and that's because the fuel resistance and chemical resistance great for motorcycles well there you go I paint my bike in a fluro color scheme I had a real damage paint work to start with so I paint stripped it all off got it down to bare metal at bare plastic then I painted the whole thing in the color scheme I wanted using a fluro color made sure I got a white base down first put the fluro on top of that and then try to sweep it on top so that's how you paint your colors make sure you get that white down first put the fluo on then you put a clear coat on to protect it so I'm yeah pretty ho with the with the finish and next time you&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;dgkt4W8fWVA&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hi everyone its tutorials by I here and I am filming the intro and outro here for the second time because it turns out I chose a name that was it's like one letter away from being the same thing as another rainbow loom bracelets name it was originally the love link bracelet but there's a bracelet called the love links bracelet so I am changing this name to the heart link bracelet so anyway it's in the tutorial if you ever hear me call this the love link bracelet just completely ignore me because I'm just refilling the intro and outro only so anyways don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and now without further ado let's get started so today you will need any type of loom you can also use a monster tail for this design but I won't be doing a tutorial on that since it's pretty easy to transfer the design you'll also need about 35 to 40 bands today I'll be using the rainbow loom comm silicone bands and the colors of metallic gold metallic silver and glitter white you will also need a hook I'll be using a metal tip took today however this bracelet does not cause any stress on your hook at all pretty much so you can use any kind of hook and you'll also need one c-clip all eye supplies today are from rainbow loom calm and now without further ado let's get started first off you're going to take whatever color you're using for your cap band and twist that on two pins so that way you've got a figure eight here and it doesn't matter the direction that it's twisted in then you're going to take your next band and this is going to be one of the links that connects the hearts together so whatever color like in this case I use this solid white so I'm just going to use this color and then hook over the bottom layer on both sides so that way you're left with one layer on the pins here after that we're going to start by making our first heart I'm going to be using my silver for the outside of the heart so you're going to take your first band of whatever you're going to use for the outside of the heart you're going to place it on this bottom on this left pin right here and then you're going to twist it to the left as you place it onto this pin right here so if I show you that one more time because it's very important the direction in which you twist it put it on this bottom pin and twist it to the left so that way as you can see the layer on top is this diagonal one we're going to do another band on these two pins here you're going to start at the top right this time and then twist downwards to the left so that you get something like that so as you can see the band that's laying on top here is the vertical one now we are going to add a horizontal layer of whatever color you want the inside of your heart to be and then we're going to do the hooking process so you're going to go over to this pin here and you're going to grab this layer and pull that over the pin and release then you're going to go over here and grab this layer and pull that over and release just like that and now we're going to hook at the two bands over here you're going to grab the very bottom layer and pull that over and on this side you're going to grab the very bottom layer only and pull that over as well and everything is going to be kind of loose that's totally normal then you're going to push everything down and now we are going to do a little bit of transferring you're going to use your hook and grab this one band here pull it off of the pin and then you're going to place it onto this bottom right pin here so don't be afraid to use your fingers for this just in case things happen to get loose and fall off or anything and we're going to do the same thing to the left side you're going to grab this band here pull it off of the pin and then carefully transfer it onto here make sure that this gold band here or whatever color you're using isn't twisted so that way you get something like this it's okay that these silver bands are SuperDuper loose so don't worry about that next you're going to grab whatever color you're using for the link that goes in between each of the hearts and put that right on top so that we get something like this and here's where you can kind of create variations of this bracelet after you finish making this one but for this specific bracelet we're going to grab the bottom two layers on each pin pull over so bottom two layers oops sorry O's kind of off them Center you're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull over on the right and then do the same thing on the left grab the silver and the gold layer and pull that over so that way all we have left is one layer on our pin and as you can see this is one heart right here so we're complete we've completed that heart and we're going to do our next one now so you're going to go on ahead and add on your heart bands again for the first one that we put on the left remember we're going to put it on the bottom one and then twist it to the left as you place it on that pin just like that and now we're going to add on the one that goes on the right side you're going to take one single band put it on the top right pin this time and then twist to the left as well again twisting the bands in the correct direction is very very important for this you're going to next grab your band that's going to go in the center and now it's time to start the hooking process for the left we're going to grab this band right here and pull that over the pin and release and then for the right we're going to grab this bottom band here and pull that over the pin and release so that we get something like this next for the bottom here we're going to grab the bottom layer and pull over grab the bottom layer again and pull over make sure you're not going inside of the band to grab that stay on the outside and pull that over so after that now we've got to make our two edges that go together so we're going to go here and pull this and place it onto here make sure you're not folding over the band's grab this top left pin and place it over here after that it is now time to add on our layer that links the hearts together and then we're going to do the hooking process so for the hooking process you're going to grab the bottom two and pull over and then grab the bottom two and pull over again and it doesn't matter you can hook the left side first and then the right it doesn't matter so now as you can see we've got two hearts so far that's basically what that looks like and then we're going to do the same exact thing again so I'm going to add my silver bands on the outside this time so you're going to start at the bottom left and then twist that to the left then we're going to go to the top right and twist to the left so that way the twists are like this so that way the diagonal ones on top here and the vertical ones on top over here after that we're going to add the horizontal band on top for whatever band's going to be in the center of the heart and then we're going to do the hooking process so it doesn't matter which side you do first I just like to do the left side first so you're going to grab this band right here and pull that over grab this thin right here and pull that over just like that now we're going to hook the bottom layers over on these two pins here so grab the bottom layer pull that over and grab the bottom layer here and pull that over as well so that way you get something like this after that it's time to connect these two together so you're going to grab this side here and place that on to this bottom pin just like that now we're going to go on this side here grab this band and place this band onto the bottom right here so that way you have the layers all together here you want to make sure they're all together before we add on our linking one the one that links all the hearts together and so for this we're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull that up and over the pin on both sides bottom two up and oak so now we've got three hearts so far so we're going to do the same exact thing again start on the bottom left and twist to the left so that way this layer right here is on top now we're going to go on the top right and twist to the left again so that way the vertical layers on top after that we're going to add the center of the heart and it's time to start the hooking process so for the hooking process you're grabbing whatever layers on top as you can see this diagonal band part is right on top so we're going to grab that pull that over and then here the vertical band is on top here so you're going to pull that over and now it's time to hook the bottom bands bottom bands pull over bottom bands pull over again push those down and now it's time to make these go on the same pins so you're going to grab this here pull that off carefully and place that on to this pin same thing with the left side grab this and place this on to the left as well so that way we've got them all on the same pins here now it's time to grab one single band pull that over and then we're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull over bottom two layers and pull over so that we've got something like this so far I'll be showing you how to do the hearts three more times so that's just to give you an idea of how many more times I'll be showing you how to do this again or not again actually I haven't said this yet but if you do have trouble with making after I'm finished you can always rewind and re-watch the previous instructions and yeah so let's go ahead and start on our first of the three so grab one of your border bands place on the bottom left pin and then we're going to twist it to the left then we're going to grab another band put it on the top right this time and twist that to the left as well after that we're going to grab the band that goes into the center of the heart and place it across the top two pins so that way you get something like this on your loom and it is now time to start the hooking process so we're going to grab the bottom layer here and pull that over and release then we're going to grab the layer here pull that over so that we've got something like this now with your hook you're going to grab the bottom layer on the left and pull over and the bottom layer on the right and pull over so that way you've got something like this on your loom now it's time to make all these on the same pins so you're going to grab this layer here and transfer that right there this layer here and transfer that down there so that way we've got them stacked on the pins together now we are going to go ahead add on this layer here so that way it goes across and then we're going to grab the bottom two and pull over on both sides and then we've got this heart here so we're going to do the same thing again pin on the bottom left and then twist up to the top left and you're twisting to the left on that then we're going to start on the top right and twist to the left so that way you get something like this then we're going to grab one of our horizontal bands in place that go in across and then we are going to do the hooking process by grabbing this and twisting grabbing this and twisting that over or basically what we're doing with the hooking process is untwisting it so that way when you got the heart bands here none of them are twisted so now we are going to go down here and grab the bottom band and pull over on both of these pins so that way you get something like this after that we're going to go over here and transfer these two sides down to the bottom two pins just like that so you've got this here then you're going to grab one of the chain links that links all the hearts together and then we're going to do the hooking process by grabbing the bottom two and pulling over on both sides just like that so you should have something like this now and the hearts are upside down right now but anyways I'm going to show you how to do the heart one last time and then after that I'll be going off-camera to finish off my bracelet and yeah so you're going to start on the bottom left and twist to the left as you place it upwards then you're going to stop on the tart tart right what you're going to start on the top right and twist that downwards or to the left and pull downwards I'm getting all tongue-tied today and then you are going to grab whatever color you're going to put in the center of your heart and take your hook and we're now going to hook these layers over at the top here and then we're going to hook the bottom layers over on the bottom pins here just like that now we are going to transfer the top to down to the bottom two so grab that pull that down wrap this pull this down as well and then to finish off the heart we're going to add a link that connects the hearts all together bottom to pull over and bottom to pull over so when you're finished you should get something like this and you may have bands that are twisted a little bit so that way they get kind of crazy in the links but you can always just fix that by untwisting so anyways this is what my love link bracelet looks like so far I decided to go for an elegant look with the metallics today but anyways you're going to go ahead and continue that same process until you've got a full bracelets length we're pretty close right now I'll probably only have to do two or three more hearts so if you're still having trouble then feel free to rewind the video and rewatch the previous instructions and follow along again if you're doing great then go ahead and finish off your bracelet or finish off the length of the bracelet that you need and I will be back to show you how to take this off of your loom okay so I'm now finished with my bracelet and finishing off this is SuperDuper easy all you got to do is grab the left side or make sure that you finished off with one layer on to the pins and I'm just going to grab the left side and pull that over to the right so that way I've got two layers on one pin then I'm going to take my c-clip and slide this on to both layers by the way I am using a large c-clip today because this is what came with my rainbow loom silicone bands which is really helpful in some cases when I do have a lot of bands on my pins but anyway just make sure your bracelet isn't twisted and then add the cap band layers at the beginning on to your c-clip here and that is how you make this really cool heart link bracelet so anyways sorry about the name confusion thing and yeah don't forget

I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now I'm\ngoing to show you how to roll the dough. First I divide the dough into 3 parts. So it would\nnot be too hard to work with. I'm putting the first piece on the table and just squishing\nit a little bit so it would be easier to roll it. I'm just taking the rolling pin and rolling\nit. It should not be too thin. It should be about half a inch thick. Once I finish the\nfirst one, I'm going to do the second one to and the third one after that because it\nis just more convenient to first roll all the dough. Then to shape it. Remember not\nto make it too thin cause you would not be able to put the wooden sticks in. The second\none is done and I'm going to take the the third one and do the same thing over again.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;th1F-2wCRVA&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;scaling and root planing is frequently referred to as deep cleaning deep cleaning is the treatment of choice for an infectious disease called periodontal disease so what is periodontal disease periodontal disease mainly starts with the formation of plaque around the teeth plaque is the yellow film on your teeth caused by food and bacteria in your mouth when plaque buildup mixes with the saliva it hardens over time and turns into tartar tartar containing bacteria will irritate the gums around the teeth by attaching to the outer surface of the teeth and roots and releases poisonous toxins these toxins cause an infection and an inflammation of the gums worse if left untreated they can ultimately cause bone loss and eventually tooth loss keep in mind the lost bone will never grow back fortunately deep cleaning can help deep cleaning is a procedure that treats the infected area by meticulously cleaning the tartar and bacteria from the teeth and their roots deep-cleaning or scaling and root planing is normally performed by your dentist or dental hygienist in a couple of visits the exact number of visits however depends on your dentist and the amount of tartar buildup often your dentist will choose to administer a local anesthetic to make the procedure virtually painless the deep cleaning is either done manually or with an ultrasonic instrument called a Cavett Ron or sometimes a combination of the two both techniques loosen and remove plaque and tartar buildup in addition antibacterial irrigants or local antibiotics such as a Reston may be used in conjunction with the cleaning procedure to further reduce the number of bacteria around the gums also keep in mind although rare one or more of the following symptoms can occur after treatment bleeding of the gum inadvertent removal or irritation of the gum teeth discomfort such as sensitivity to hot and cold or sweets swelling and inflammation of the gum and finally allergies to some of the materials used during the procedure you may ask yourself can I get a regular cleaning instead the answer is no as the name deep cleaning implies the main difference is that deep cleaning goes below the gum to remove plaque or tartar buildup from the tooths root where the bone is affected by the infection whereas regular cleaning only removes the plaque or tartar above the gum periodontal disease cannot currently be cured it can only be controlled so it's important to follow your dentist's recommendations for follow-up maintenance and treatment in addition to routine checkups performing proper dental hygiene at home is of course also important to help prevent the recurrence of this destructive disease please check with your dentist or dental hygienist if you have any additional questions&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;sXY0wAwqO5g&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hey guys for today's video I wanted to show you how to create my favorite DIY back acne spray I have been using this for two to three years and it has absolutely saved my chest and my back of a lot of blemishes blackheads and even scarring it only contains five ingredients that are all super powerful super potent and super amazing for your skin so I'm going to talk you through what I do to create this what the ingredients do and why they're beneficial and take you through something that I have been loving for years so what you're going to need is a spray bottle to spray this onto your back or chest or body you're going to need a mixing jar to mix things in you're going to need something to mix with I've got a chopstick classy and then you're also going to need the ingredients which I will definitely list in the bottom tab so first things first we need kind of a base for me I am using this one this is pure aloe vera this is aloe vera juice and it is a dietary supplement but it's also very beneficial to skin aloe vera is supremely healing a lot of people use it after they get a sunburn but if you have acne or even rosacea or eczema it's very beneficial it can soothe any of that redness can suit a lot of dryness and it can really just calm down skin so I am using exactly one cup of aloe vera juice for mine because I'm going to be keeping this in the fridge and use it until my acne is gone or until I run out next I'm going to take out my nifty measuring spoons and take the half teaspoon measuring spoon if you guys can see these are actually crazy cat lady measuring spoons which just make my entire life and taking some desert essence tea tree oil tea tree oil is amazing it's naturally antibacterial and antifungal and although it is an oil is non-comedogenic to skin it does have some healing properties but mainly it is this really powerful germ killer it does have quite a scent to it and you should never use it full strength on your face and so for this entire cup of aloe vera juice I am just putting in one half teaspoon I really find the smell refreshing it makes me think and smell like I'm getting clear skin which is obviously a psychological connection that I make to tea tree oil but it is natural it is great and I would definitely recommend giving it a sniff that some people don't like it next I'm going to some apple cider vinegar and this one is with the mother basically whenever vinegar is created there is this filmy foamy goopy little thing which is called the mother which is the starter for all vinegars vinegar is fermented and they all need this mother in order to create vinegar and this apple cider vinegar is a great astringent this helps to clean pores it can actually close down pores and it helps to dissolve blackheads so if you've got back acne that is active or if you have blackheads or scarring this is an essential I'm just gonna take one teaspoon I know a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers used to use this to cure a lot of problems and they were right so I'm putting that in and giving it a stir next it's time for one of my personal skin saviors this is ho ho ba oil from Trader Joe's it's spelled jojoba oil however much can be super confusing because sometimes in videos I say Oklahoma and people like no it's Jo Jo Bob then I used to say jojoba and people like no it's oh ho ha and people go to the store and they're like I saw jojoba but I didn't get it because you said oh ho lo out or I saw a bulb up it didn't get eggs you said jojoba anyways that is what it is and this is what it is so regardless of how you say it this is how you spell it what's amazing about this oil is it again it is generally non comedogenic it is supreme if you have dry skin and don't forget most acne prone skin is dry skin in disguise and especially for our backs and for our chests we normally don't moisturize this is where the hot hot water from the shower hits our backs that hot water can dry out and strip our skin so while hot showers feel good that's why they can cause some breakouts so this really gives that area the hydration that it needs I'm taking 1 tbsp of it stir stir stir very last but not least I'm going to add rose water rose water is amazing because it is very calming for skin now anything in life has a frequency a frequency is a scientific term - how many wavelengths are given off of a certain thing vibrant sees basically things with a higher frequency vibrate more or vibrate quicker things with the lower frequency vibrate less people who are on their deathbed and normally have a frequency between 20 and 40 Hertz which is very very low the human body generally functions better higher and that's why some people believe in the magical healing properties of stones because certain stones and certain rocks have certain frequencies and when some people wear those they feel like they absorb that vibrational energy that is obviously susceptible to the individual and I'm sure different people pick up on different things but roses rose water rose essence and rose oil has one of the highest frequencies I think it's around 250 to 300 which is scientifically proven that your body can rose water is wonderful because it naturally boosts up your frequency which makes your cells better at healing which makes your cells more prone to collagen production and which overall gives them a better foundation to build healthy strong skin so I am taking this and it comes in a spray bottle already this one's just from Whole Foods and I'm going to add two tablespoons when it comes to your rose water you do want to make sure that it's a hundred percent pure rose water you don't want it to be diluted with other things the reason that I'm using rose water instead of rose oil in this particular case is because I want to make sure that my solution is sprayable and not all oils so now that that's in it is time to mix this up once that is sufficiently stirred you can put the lid on and save it for later or you can put it in your spray bottle and start using it immediately this is one of my absolute favorite concoctions or recipes it really has saved a lot of my chest and back acne I started doing this about two years ago and I will never go back there are a lot of over-the-counter products that I look to but this is amazing and also when we're in the shower or when we're getting ready every day and cleansing our face in the morning and evening sometimes it's hard to get our chest on our back every single day so this is the savior and again you spray it on it's so easy so every single time you use it you will have to shake it whether it's in this container or in your spray bottle just because oil and some of the liquids will naturally separate but that's what it is and I really hope that you guys enjoy so if you guys want more DIY videos let me know what you're interested in post a comment about what videos you want to see and subscribe and give this video a

want you to look look look at the paint job I just got done doing hopefully you can see I've done this video about two times by my camera I was full and I had to read delete some stuff but um I just repainted the fender of my motorcycle and this is the same paint that I painted it before trying to eat it out here without scratching it there we go I want to show you before and after kind of look how about that huh that's pretty good right I mean it's decent I mean it's the best I've ever done yeah so I think that's pretty cool I'll lay this right here zoom out a little bit get really good comparison view I did it all with spray cans and so I'm going to show you here what I did check it out head to your local Riley's and I get yourself some spray can paint and this color here is forest green pearl and this is the clear coat here and I did it all outside - I did it right there and it's all about wet sanding you want to lay some you know lay some paint on sand it I got some some wet sandpaper 2000 grit there's a piece I was using a little bit earlier using your hose just to keep it wet keep it sandy ten minutes in between coats let it dry and let's and it it smoothes you can get all of that orange peel out of it and then add another dry it off I used a heat gun to get rid of all the moisture just you know lightly don't don't go crazy with it or you just peel the paint off of there and then apply another coat of paint you know I'm gonna drive two minutes and it again every time then you apply your finish paint sand it women last time nice and perfectly smooth there's West you know the best as you can get it because that's what's gonna be forever get that apply your clear coat late on a thick and that's pretty much it you know it doesn't really matter about the equipment and all the other stuff have professional equipment isn't that there were spray cans it's just about how much time and effort you put into it you know maybe some things make it easier than others but you know just about how much time you want to sit there and rub on it you know thanks for watching youtube apparently I'm going to be repainting my entire bike because I can actually do a good job at it apparently so keep you updated with that and I'll show you some progress pictures probably the next one I'll do is the pretty easy one is these side panels the little side panels which are on the side in case you didn't know there's one on each side and then I'll hit the back fender here bigger than it looks and then finally I'll get the gas tank cuz you know of course the gas tank is not fun because you have to drain the gas out and all that stuff so I am just amazed and what I did that's why I had to share it with YouTube hope you all try it out you ever have something you want to thank and thanks for watching&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;MWJenjiy2Vo&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hi everyone its Bella from five quilt NC kids and today I'm showing you how to make this single chain rubber band bracelet this is probably the easiest rubber band bracelet you can possibly make and I'm going to be using the same colors blue I mean blue and pink what you're going to need are rubber bands and the two colors or you could do possibly more whatever colors you want and the two three or four colors however many you want you possibly need and a C or s clip or end it however you like you can use your fingers the rainbow loom or these two pencils these defenses will hold it by a Lego block and it just makes it easier for me to put it on since this is no loom I'm going to be using this so you take your first color which mine is going to be blue and place it on and twist so that it makes an eighth I like to use unsharpened pencils so you don't get poked with them okay so now I'm going to take my next color which is pink and place it on top once you do that you're going to pull the bottom up and over your pink make sure you push your bands down so they don't come off then you're gonna take the other one and pull it over now for this one if you're using two colors you're always going to put on the colors you pulled up so I pulled up a blue so my next color I'm going to put on is going to be a blue that's how you would know but I don't know if this works for any more than two different colors off to find out but I just I'm just going to take this off so what you're going to do is you're just going to keep pulling up the bottom until your bracelet is done I'm going to show you this about three more times then I believe you should be able to get it on your own put on the color that you pulled up or just watch the pattern so my next one is going to be pink pull my bottom up and over the pencil and you never twist any more rubber bands except for your very first one you like these are not twisted these are just plain just so you know that and then pull back the set up once you got both sides up there you go two more times I'm going to put this one on and you see how this gun can comment close to the top just push them down that's good now pull your pink up and above this and my must so so far your bracelet should be looking like this it stretches so make it a little bit smaller than it would fit around your wrist show you one last one and then I'll show you how to finish off your bracelet make sure it's long enough and ilex really do two instead of just one there you go okay so make sure it's long enough and then I'll show you how to finish it okay so this looks like it should be long enough for me now so how this is how I finish it you then take this side of one or it could be this side whatever side but I'm going to take this side and take it off making sure that the set is still on do not let go because anything will fall off make sure you hold it then place it on this side also so instead of one bit over here and one bit over here now you just have to on one side so there you go then you're going to get your C or s clip or however you end it I don't know Alice you do it but so this is our C clip and you're going to clip if I pull this side out so you can clip it in and let go then you can get this side pull it whoops make sure you open it up so the clip can go in just like so there you go so the C clip is holding these two ends together then you can just pull it right off and your bracelet is done there you go alright thanks for what thanks for watching this video I hope you liked it please like so then subscribe see

treat for your special someone it's cheap quick and excellent for the zelda fan it's also pretty damn delicious here's what you'll need 1 cup of flour a third teaspoon of baking soda a third cup of soft butter a third cup of sugar 1 egg a teaspoon of vanilla and some food coloring this part is optional of course prep a nice bowl and toss in the flour and the baking soda mix like a crazy person in place aside in another bowl mix in the sugar and the butter until it turns into a paste at the vanilla and the egg to the mixture until it looks something like this this is the optional part grab two bowls and four equal portions of the mixture into them now add the food coloring you should end up with pink and yellow goopy goodness add a half cup of flour to each mixture to create the cookie dough this should be easy enough grab some wax paper and wrap up the dough's like this put them in the freezer for 10 minutes after these ten minutes your dough should be somewhat stiff and easy to roll out flour your work space and start rolling out your work at this point it's smart to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees to now if you don't have Triforce and heart-shaped cookie cutters like me you can easily use a spatula and a spoon to make your own shapes what I did was make a base shape and trace the other cookies around it kind of this place your cutouts on a greased cookie sheet and stick it in the oven for seven to eight minutes during the meantime you can take a nap or check out the latest on plate look I did once out of the oven set the cookies on a plate to cool off enjoy their awesomeness for a while if you want to add more to your work grab a glass charm any jar really if you're in a hurry you can grab the nearest newspaper and cut out a small sheet to cover the jars logos kind of like this really talk to your cookies in the jar nothing is more refreshing than lon lon milk right get a piece of paper and a blue marker to draw out the lon lon milk label I'm not the greatest artist when it comes to being fast so forgive my poor artistic skills cut up the label and tape it around a glass or a water bottle here I have a glass bottle which looks great milk and cookies never tasted so awesome this shouldn't take you more than an hour and it's a really cool way to swing your gamer Valentine on behalf of plate here's wishing you guys an awesome valentine's day

guys this videos going to be about painting a motorcycle gas tank this tanks off of the 1972 Honda CB 350 first thing we need to do is strip off the existing paint to do that we're going to use a normal paint strip or you can get at any Home Depot or Lowe's be careful with it you don't want to get it on your skin it'll burn but just be careful these gloves and you should be good so we're going to paint brush and put the paint stripper in a container and then just brush it on and it'll take a little while for it to work but it'll be pretty obvious once it does because the paint will start to lift up off the metal we're going to continue to do this until the entire tank is covered in paint stripper and then wait about five to 10 minutes as you can see after not a whole lot of time the paint starts to lift up pretty quickly at this point you're going to want to get a paint scraper or anything with a flat edge and just start to remove some of this loose paint and now we just want to continue this process of applying the paint stripper and stripping off loose paint until all the paint's removed at this point we've removed all the paint off of the tank and we're going to get some sandpaper I want to get medium to fine grit sandpaper and just sand the whole surface to prepare it for paint it'll just rough it up a little bit to the panel adhere better and just even out the whole surface once you sanded it down you want to wipe off the what comes up when you're sand make sure that doesn't get caught in the paint when you go to paint so just go over thoroughly and you might want to even get a compressed air and blow out all the different areas just to make sure you get all that that's not dust but it looks like dust up so it doesn't get stuck in the paint that would be counterproductive to sanding so make sure you go over it a few times blow it out with some air and then after that we should be ready to paint so we're going to start off with a primer as you can see here you definitely wanna start off with a layer primer just to help the next layers of paint stick better and just better overall now we're ready to put on the next coat all right so now we're ready to put on our first layer of paint we're going to paint it red so see how it goes so we finished our first layer and we're going to wait about ten minutes then we'll put on another layer alright so now we're going to put on our next layer of paint once we've applied the number of coats that we want to paint we're going to use a acrylic clear coat enamel just to help protect the paint and just makes everything look

to yos recipe box I'm going to show you how to make homemade chocolates filled with chocolate cake vanilla cake cookie dough Oreo cookies and strawberry marshmallows I made these chocolates for my box of chocolate cake which you can watch right here but you can just make them and put them in a pretty little box and give it to your friends giving to your mama mama bakes we're not really thank you okay yeah you're right mama eats chocolate to make these chocolates I'm using six different colors of candy melts I melt about a bag of each chocolate I then fill six piping bags with each of my colored chocolates it's great to use a disposable piping bag the type you can put in the microwave because if your chocolate sets up Midway you can always throw it in the microwave give it a good need get back to making chocolates I'm using a chocolate mold that kind of looks like a giant jet I think that it's perfect for this day or any day I'll put a link to where I got my mold in the description below I filled the chocolate mold by piping around the edge of each cavity and letting the chocolate cool down at the bottom then I flip the mold over and tap it just to shake out any of the excess chocolate but all of the sides should be left coated I'm going to make one tray of each color turn your mold back over and give it a nice tap on your work surface just to bang out any air bubbles you're not welcome here err get back in the air air bubbles are gone real on Oh calm down okay every box of chocolates should have variety so I'm going to use six different fillings for each one of my molds in the white chocolate mold I put chopped up Oreos and in the yellow chocolate I put little rounds of pink vanilla cake in my pink chocolate I put green vanilla cake and in my green chocolate I put chocolate cake finally from my milk chocolate I added little cookie dough ball and for my dark chocolate a strawberry marshmallow when you add your fillings you want to press them down slightly so they're in the chocolate and they're not sticking out on the top of the mold I use the same color of chocolate to pipe a layer of chocolate and close up all of the molds then once again we need to tap these molds because who's not welcome here air bubbles you just want to scrape away any excess chocolate and leave it nice and flat on the bottom well what's now the top let your molds set I find it helpful to put them in the fridge for like 10-15 minutes and then you can take them out and then you can just pop them out turn the mold over and just you know pop release the chocolate if you find that any of your chocolates have like a little rim you can use a sharp paring knife and just sort of neaten up the edges these are gems these are you know like diamonds they got to look crisp I'm going to use different colored Luster's to really bring out these chocolates have fun you can mix colors through a bit of gold in there paint different patterns on them just use a nice brush brush away happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there from one mom to another get yourself a box of chocolates don't forget to subscribe to this channel I have a lot of great cake videos and a lot of great playlists it's air bubble free do you need another reason you really need air bubbles I do&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;RAidUDTPZ-k&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;everyone we're going to cut some spray moderns now today I'm gonna be painting this motorcycle to be left in the weather we've had some bush fires - has come down and completely ruined that paint so I need to strip it all back and start from scratch I'm going to use some paint stripper get it all that old paint use some it's primer and primer and then I'll be ready for my color scheme so I'm here first going to do is start pulling it apart from government okay now I'll even strip the paint off these parts I've got a metal tank and some other plastic parts so that means for the metal tank I can use a normal automotive paint stripper for the plastic parts I need to use a a paint stripper that's suitable for plastic this paint stripper will rip the paint off but it won't affect the plastic parts and it's perfect for bumper bars or plastic black part anything like that but I'll just need to strip this paint off because it's pretty much infected the clear coat the color and the primer it's been infected and it's anything that's going to go on top of that it's just going to crack or get damaged again because that base isn't in good condition so if you've got a car or panels that have sun damage cracked color cracked clear coat really in a pain strip it all off so that your new paint on top will last long time hey before I slap paint stripping I like to sand it with some 80 grit sandpaper first that allows the hamster but it really bought into the paint and do its job so I'm going to handle these parts with some a degree of dry sandpaper then apply that paint stripper on like I said before I'm going to be using a plastic paint stripper that's not gonna affect my plastic is going to rip that paint off when using paint stripper you want to apply it really thick that's going to allow to penetrate that that paint really well and allow that pain to just strip off as easy as possible once you can see that the paint stripper has done its job you can use a metal paint scraper or you can use some scotch brite pads to give it a little extra help and remove the rest of that paint if all the paint hasn't come off the first time of using paint stripper you can give it another go just to get that excess paint off there and just keep going until it's all off the product that you want stripped okay so I paint strip the whole tank there's no more pain left on it just got a bare metal tank now because I did use paint stripper on it I need to clean it with water and then clean it with a metal conditioner or rust converter something that's going to get rid of all about painting stripper residue before I put my primer on otherwise the paint stripper is still in that metal stuck to that metal somehow and it's going to come through the primer that's going to cause problems and we don't want that so I'm going to clean it with water rust converter water again sand it back some grease remover but I'm ready for my primer okay now I'm going to spray my epoxy primer so it basically you can go onto bare metal and it gives a nice fill as well so two or three coats of this and I'll be ready to start standing after dries so yeah daddy's 2 mil spray gun and I've prepared my metal tank so it shouldn't be too hard let's mix it up as always when it comes to primer apply three / wait 10-15 minutes to encode for the plastic part I'm going to use a plastic fiber build primer goes on bare plastic and I just need a sander with some 800 grit wet sandpaper then I can start painting well there you go that's how you pay strip metal and paint your plastic and it's always important to keep your painterly metal make sure you treat that metal before you start applying your primer I used a rust converter you can use a metal conditioner definitely if you paint stripping you need to treat that metal otherwise papers are can stick your arm up and you can just peel off and you get problems later on yeah so once you've got that you need panels all in bare metal it's time to put your primer is an epoxy primer but you can also use a either a 1-page primer a 2k edge primer or you can use the all you need from err basically you want to just think about what topcoat you're going to use if you using 1k products for your topcoat use 1kh primer using 2k products use a 2k Brahma and should be right so um yeah I've got this all primed and put into the boot and do my top goes alright so I decided to paint my whole black the track race bearings and everything not just the tank in there and the plastic parts so I'm going to paint it in a fluoro color which was suggested by someone on my last video and I picked the color scheme from the NGM forward racing team colors moto gp so I thought I'll give this color scheme ago and I'm here I'm up at now crazy little with wax and grease remover I'm about to spray some 2k transparent sealer on it which is going to help the new paint stick and then I'll be ready to start my color scheme so let's do it next time on custom three mugs

youtube today we're going to be going over the water flosser it's going to be a quick video just going over what it comes with how to use it with pressure level to use how to clean it where to buy it and the pricing you can buy it for so let's go ahead and get started you're going to get about six tips the unit self the housing water housing and the lid that holds all your tips you're going to get a manual and all that other good stuff that's in the box you don't really need to see that so how you're going to use this unit it's very simple I'm not going to go into too much detail but you're going to choose the desired tip you know I like using the jet tip mainly once I got braces I use this a lot but you're going to go ahead and block that tip in there's a release button right here there is a button stop your pressure level are not pressure level sorry to stop the water from shooting out and then you're going to get adjustment for your different pressure level and on and off switch okay what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to fill this up with warm water cold water is no good really hot water is not fun so you're going to want warm walk warm water I do put mouthwash in mind to just give me that extra freshness I do recommend that I believe a lot of dentists recommend that as well what you're going to use this for is once your once your units filled and once this is ready in your mouth you're going to want to put in your mouth before you turn it on or else it's going to just shoot water everywhere is you're going to want to go move from your teeth your gum lines in between your teeth you're going to want to hold for about four seconds and then move on through over your gum lines again and stop a for a second so you're just going to be when your gum lines move into twos a tooth and once you're finished with your front to the back of your teeth that is totally fine if you're using it for braces you're going to want to follow and clean each bracket and also in between your gum lines I kind of do my brackets first and then I'll change out to the jet tip and do in between my gum lines that's just me you can also use this three times a day twice a day or once a day that's totally up to you now move it on to how to clean the unit so cleaning the unit is going to be fairly easy the last thing you want to do is leave any water into this reservoir or unit or in the handle at all so when you're done with the unit what you don't want to do is empty all the water out of the reservoir you're going to want to leave this unit on for a little bit so it shoots all the excess water out once the excess water is out you remove the tip and you want to kind of spill out that water or you can let it air dry upside down what this does is basically if you leave a lot of water residue inside of there and it can cause molding and all that gross nasty stuff to build and that's the last thing you want in your mouth you know yeah who knows what can happen you can get sick it would give you bad diseases who knows anyways with the reservoir itself - I don't put it right back in because this kids still have a little bit of water I flip it around and place it just like that okay and this you can just cap it back on however you want I don't always leave mine upside down I figure if this is good enough without the tip or anything it will air out itself now still at once a month you're gonna want to clean out your whole unit with vinegar and water some people use soap however you want to do it just make sure that whenever you clean it with you're running it through with warm or really hot water just to make sure you get that excess soap or vinegar outside out of your unit before you use your unit now go into where you can purchase one you can purchase one you know I got your local convenience store I believe that Walmart Rite Aid and all that you can target even has it but what I recommend is wait a couple more days get it cheaper amazon.com celibate for around forty two bucks so that's my short video of the Water Pik I know we went through it pretty fast if you need to learn how to use the Water Pik there's a lot of videos out there that that you can find that dentists are showing you how to use the Water Pik and everything like that I really wanted just to go over how to clean your unit and where to buy it that's pretty much the whole point of this video so thanks for watching I hope this helped and have a nice day&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ZkgJQLtQ1hg&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hey guys this is the bow welcome back to my channel and today I'm gonna be making a body skincare video and in this video I'm gonna show you how to get rid of back acne in just one week now the question when you always get in your mind whenever you watch any kind of video like this is does it really work and my answer to this is that it definitely works maybe for some people it will take a little bit more time than one week but for most people it will definitely show an improving result in just one week so I think it is definitely worth trying if you have back acne and who knows it might just really help you if you aren't already subscribed to my channel then please hit the subscribe button below and be a part of my skincare family where we talk everything about skincare also make sure to press that Bell icon because that's going to notify you the next time I upload a new video and I make new skincare videos every single week and definitely don't want to miss it right and without further ado let's get this video started so this is the back of my shoulder and as you can see there are a few scars from the pimples that I had which are now gone it has been over a week now and almost all of the pimples are slowly fading away I usually have a few pimples on my back and chest but whenever I include this simple step in my shower every day I don't really get pimples say from now on I won't be lazy and I'll make sure to clear this in my shower every day so if you are someone like me who's going through the same situation then you should give it a try because I think it really makes a difference all you need is an exfoliating gloves or a body brush and a shower gel and this detalle antiseptic liquid which is the main thing in this step you can get a pair of exfoliating gloves in your local beauty supply store or you can also buy it online through eBay or Amazon and it's actually really cheap now for the body wash make sure that your body wash is not too nourishing or moisturizing because the body wash that says it is deep moisturizing usually contains more oil which is not a good choice for people who tend to get pimples on their body too this is usually because some part of the body more oil and when it is mixed with sweat and dirt it creates bacteria which end up clogging the pores that later turn into pimples so do not use a nourishing or deep moisturizing creamy body wash and if you cannot find exfoliating gloves you can also use exfoliating brushes or some loofahs and try to use it every day in the shower I usually take shower before I go to bed or sometimes I also take shower in the morning if I feel like it or sometimes I'll just shower during the day if I workout and I always include this routine in my shower because I can see that it really helps because if I don't do it then I'm sure that it's going to show up on my back I mean the pimples you know so I always make sure to include this in my shower that is one more very important thing that you have to make sure to do and that is to never wear the same t-shirt undershirt first bra or whatever you wear that's the first layer touching your skin because throughout the day you will be spreading and your skin will produce oil too so the sweat and oil will stick to your clothes and it is already creating a room for developing bacterias and if you wear the same shirt the next day the bacterias that are in your shirt will travel into you're already sweating skin and imagine when all these happens and I know the way I explained it seemed a little bit too intense or too detailed but this is not my OCD this is the truth you know I think this is how scientifically bacterias travel into your body and create a mess I know that there are people who does not get affected by this because they are lucky to have a stronger defensive skin but if you are watching this then obviously your skin breaks out right so this is something very important that you need to change in your lifestyle so that you can fight against this bacteria and be able to have a pimple free back so make sure to wear a clean washed top every single day so summary of the video is to use exfoliating gloves or brush and use a shower gel and add a little bit of de taÃ¼ll antiseptic liquid in it and include this in your shower routine every single day and never wear the same shirt the next day even if it seems or smells clean and laughs we do not try this on your face don't even think about it alright guys that's it for this video please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it

Hi everyone, it's Beth\nfrom the Wilton test kitchen. And I'm back with another\nfrequently asked question. We actually get this question\nin all kinds of forms, a lot. People have a hard time working\nwith roll-out cookie dough. So I want to talk about\nroll-out cookie dough today, and give you some tips\nand tricks on how to be successful with that. The recipe I'm going to show\nyou today is awesome because it doesn't require any\nchilling before you can roll it out to cut out your cookies. Super huge time saver\nwhen you don't have to chill the dough down before cutting it. So this is the Wilton No\nChill Roll-Out Cookie Dough, I'm gonna show you how\nto make it right now. So I have all of my ingredients laid out. And into my bowl of my\nmixer, I'm going to pour my granulated sugar, with\ntwo sticks of butter. And it's softened, so that\nit's at room temperature, so that it can combine with my sugar really nice and easily. Use a paddle attachment,\njust mix it on low speed. And what you're looking\nfor here is for the butter and the sugar to be nice\nand creamed together. So they will be light in\ncolor, and very fluffy, just like this, that's\nexactly what you need for these cookies. Now to my butter and sugar\nmixture I'm going to add one egg and two different extracts. If I didn't mention it before,\nthese cookies are delicious. So not only are they simple\nto make and roll out, but they're also super yummy. To get that flavor I'm going\nto add vanilla extract, and also almond extract,\nso it's gonna have a dual flavor that's really awesome. One of my very favorite cookie recipes. So once these are nice and combined, we're gonna go ahead and\ncombine our dry ingredients. I have two and three quarters\ncups of all purpose flour, and to that I'm going to\nadd one teaspoon of salt which is also going to\nadd a lot of awesome flavor to my cookie, and one\nteaspoon of baking powder. I just want to give these\na quick mix together to get the baking powder and the salt combined into the flour before we add this to our butter mixture. And then I'm just going\nto go ahead and add this to my mixer, about one cup\nat a time, nice and slow. Make sure you stop your\nmixer, scrape it down, every once in a while\nso that everything gets nice and combined. So you'll see it starts to\nget really, really thick, like cookie dough, and\nyou're going to, again, want to scrape the bottom and the sides to make sure that\nthere's nothing sticking, no flour sticking to\nthe sides, or especially to the bottom of the bowl. It can collect there, so\ngive it a nice good scrape to get all those dry bits up and into the stickier dough. And give it a few more\nturns around the bowl until it becomes a nice ball. That's when your cookie dough is ready. And there you go, this\nis what it looks like, see it's really really clumped together. You don't want to over mix the dough. So as soon as it starts to\nclump together like that, that's when you wanna stop. Because the more you mix the dough, the tougher your cookies\nwill get because you'll start to develop the gluten in the flour, and that's what makes\ncookies hard and tough. So don't over mix. When it starts to ball up like this, you're perfectly ready to go! Now we're ready to roll it out. So I'm lightly dusting\nmy surface with flour, so that my dough doesn't\nstick once I put it out. We're gonna work with half\nof our dough at a time. So just eyeball in your\nbowl, about what half is, scrape it out, kind of squish it together, we wanna form a disc. And then flatten it down, just\nlike that, like into a disc. Make sure you always have a lot of flour underneath you, so that\nthis dough doesn't stick. But as you can see, I didn't\nchill my dough at all, and it's very nice consistency to roll out and play with, it's not sticking to me, it's gonna roll out\nsuper easily because it's not very cold, and we're ready to go. Gonna put just a little bit of flour also on top of the dough. And I like to give my rolling pin a little bit of flour as well, again, less sticking is better. You just want to roll\nthis cookie dough out, I like to turn it a quarter\nturn, once in a while. 'Cause this again is going\nto help prevent sticking. Now if you like thicker cookies, go ahead and roll them thicker. Your bake time will\njust be slightly longer. But I like mine a little\nbit crisp at the edges, so an eighth of an inch is perfect for me. You can see how nicely it's rolling out, not fighting back at\nall, it's not cracking. And I think that's perfect. Great! So you want to make sure you\nget it as even as possible so that your cookies\nare as even as possible when you cut them out. Now you have your cutters ready. You can cut these into, obviously, any shape or size that you like. But what I like to do is dip my cutter into a bit of flour, in\nbetween almost every cut. It's going to help the dough\nto not stick to my cutter. Just press down, all the way down. Give it a little jiggle, and release. So the dough didn't stick\nto my cutter at all. And the tiny little bit of flour that gets at the edge of the cookie\nis actually going to help seal the cookie a little\nbit, help it keep its shape a little bit better in the oven. So that's why I like to do that. So just dipping and cutting. And I'm going to cut so\nthat there is as little scrap in between my cookies as I can get. Because we can re-roll, and\nwe will re-roll our scraps, but the more times you re-roll your dough, again, the tougher it's\ngoing to get because you'll be working the flour more. So I like to place them\nas close as possible while I'm cutting, so I have\nas little scrap as possible to re-roll. So now we need to transfer\nthese to our cookie sheet. And this can be a place\nwhere cookies get misshapen so I want to give you some\ntricks on how to do it. We want to remove, if there's\na lot of excess flour, brush it off. That's the first thing. And then remove the scraps around, you can put these back in your bowl, 'cause like I said, we can reuse these. We will re-roll them. So I'm going to use a cookie spatula to get underneath my\ncookies to transfer them. Because that way I know\nthat they're supported the entire time from my countertop to my pan with no jiggling or waddling. Basically I haven't\nchanged the shape at all going from here to there. If you try and do this with your hands, your hands can wobble and shake. Which is fine, but that can\nlead to a misshapen cookie. So that's why I'm using\nthis big cookie spatula to help me along. And then as I get to the\ncookies in the center, oh, I tore one, it's no big deal. I'll throw it back in the\nbowl and I'll re-roll it. You don't need to use\nparchment with this recipe, it's not a necessity, but,\nI like using parchment whenever I bake cookies,\nbecause then I don't have to clean the pans in between bakes, so it's actually a real big time server. So that's why I'm using it today. So you'll notice I placed my cookies about an inch, to an\ninch and a half apart, you do want to allow for\na little bit of spreading just in case your dough\nis a little bit warmer than it should be, so that\nthey won't stick together. So make sure you do that when\nyou put them on your pan. Now we're gonna bake these in a preheated 350 degree oven for between\neight and 11 minutes. You just want the edges to\nget very lightly golden brown. So we're gonna pop 'em in the oven. So now while my first\nbatch bakes, I'm going to re-roll the scraps of my\nfirst part of the dough, and get my second batch of cookies ready to go into the oven. That way you're kind of cycling through baking and rolling and baking and rolling. And remember you still\nhave half of your dough in your bowl too, so just keep at it! Cool your baked cookies on a cooling grid like I've done here, and when they're completely cool, they\nare an awesome canvass for all kinds of decorating. Check 'em out, they bake completely flat, and they keep their shape awesome. They look exactly like\nthe cutter that you used. That's why I love this\nrecipe, especially because it doesn't have to chill down\nin the refrigerator first.

YouTube we're going to do a tip Hosea man angel a while back asked about how to protect your tank a lot of folks have tank bags and especially these magnetic tank guys have a tendency to stretch out the paint on your tank I don't do it I don't do this procedure all the time but it I do it my longer trips where it's going to be dusty and the bag will rub against the paint really cause scratches you do this for every day if you want so I'm going to show you what I do to protect my tank or even can be used on the side panels for saddlebags that kind of thing whether there's some type of contact with paint you can you can use this uses little trick if you love so as you can see these are pretty well protected the coatings that they had on here I don't know if they're high-tech or what but they're like a rubberized coating but still when you've got these magnets on there it doesn't hold the bag perfectly still so you got a chance for abrasion even when you clamp down these magnets they do tend to thunk and they they have a chance of nicking your paint so that's what we're going to try to protect against we're going to try to cover the surface and keep it from from getting completely messed up so fear the things you're going to need number one the sharp instrument I'm going to use my jackknife because that's what I'm used to use it exactly when I feel probably better a sharpie something pen felt it probably here's the heat of the whole thing this is clear contact cable used to call contact paper use it to like line shelfs with this particular stuff here says you can use it for covering paper type items what I like about this versus the old-style contact paper is it's reusable so if you're on a trip and you're going to be on and off the bike and you're not necessarily going to be worried about all the time to peel this off and save it and reuse it second thing that's good about having this reusable type paper it doesn't leave a horribly sticky residue on your tank it's a very light blue look it's enough to keep it in place but it works very well alrighty so we've got all our little pieces here we'll get our paper laid out think it matters which is which this is actually the plastic side of the paper that holds the plastic for you is face down and rolled up for a while so it's giving me a little bit of trouble so get our bag up here yes laid out pretty simple so you just want to go around trees it ain't got to be perfect in fact if you little fat with it just that much more coverage that you're going to have probably want to be careful that you don't get short be on your on your nice bag then I'll play and obviously pretty straightforward cut it up all lying around I was never very good at staying within lines playing coloring book session so excuse me if I'm not perfect with this now I use this for my tank bag like I said you can use your side panels side panels for the saddlebags concerned about that I use it underneath I have a front fender bag I put my tire to bag you use on the guy see our f250 it's a plastic fender and I do the same kind of thing for that to keep that protected and it's actually kept it just about brand new so you kind of get the picture here I'll get this get this punched out and then we'll we'll put her on the v-strom I can show you how it looks so now it's simply like pulling a part of detail and your weight on it Thanks the way you want like I said out of law a little large on how I did that ain't gonna look perfect it's just got to cover the surface that you want to protect so this bag actually folds up a little bit so I'm probably a little a little bit longer than I need to be on the back end of this see how I'm moving it around that's one of the cool things about this particular stuff I can take it off and click back on like I was saying before so you got that there like that now just lay your vibrate on top and you're set to go now there's probably some people out there saying how in the heck are you going to gas in there I'll show you in a sec so once again there's probably somebody out there saying how you're going to get gas in here because it's all covered up I'll simply just score careful that you don't park up your tank to score right around the gas opening this one has a key port also need to open that up actually you could just probably just peel the whole thing back because you know this area up here is not really prone to getting scratched we need to cut the whole thing out like I said ain't got to be pretty but now got full access to your gas area you got a good coating all the way around your tank like I said I use this for longer trips you can use it for everyday use but it all the magnets still still grip on and it gives you a really affordable protection against scratching chipping stuff like that if you're really concerned about that kind of thing some folks don't care it's a motorcycle that's going to get beat up and it's just clear plastic that goes over paper like this comes in a roll it's about three or four bucks a roll for like 50 yards or something like that you can get it in kitchen stores hardware stores grocery stores Walmart or whatever Mart you're living there you can you can probably find it there if you look so like subscribe share I appreciate you watching hopefully I didn't boria and

folks it is Barry here welcome to my\nvirgin kitchen now have you ever wanted to make your own homemade nostalgic video game\ncontrollers. Yeah you have, yeah you have. So a couple of weeks ago I ordered from America\nthese video game controller moulds and actually in that time one of my favourite youtubers\nRosanna pansino has actually used them too but they are really cool you have like a mega\ndrive controller, a Nintendo one and a playstation one. I am kind of gutted there is not an N64 controller\nin there because I spent a whole Year playing goldeneye with 3 mates I really went awol\nwith that thing. So yeah it is a cool thing I did 6 different\nversions of it and it actually turned out pretty darn cool. So this is what I did, I started with a nice\nlemon and lime ice lolly themed one and combined sprite with lemon and lime chunks and fresh\nmint. That was looking good I was excited about\nthat one. I went for a gummy style combo using some\nharibo mix, so I went for the egg the gummy bears and a coke bottle, I put that into a\nmould with some sprite, zingy times. Then I thought I would go a little bit old\nschool by making up some jelly or jello depending upon where you are in the World. So I made my mix together and then simply\npoured it straight into my mould. And for a chocolate twist I melted together\nsome chocolate and did a peanut and M&amp;amp;M style combo in one for a nice kinky surprise filling,\nand also using the melted chocolate I used some bashed up honeycomb and some mini marshmallow\npieces looking so good and that one surprisingly tasted good too. And a white chocolate one, but this time trying\nto give it a white polka dot feel using some popping candy so popping candy and melted\nwhite chocolate looking good. Now of course the hard bit is putting it in\nthe fridge or freezer to let it set now if you use baking chocolate that will set pretty\ndarn fast but if making the lollies you will have to wait a little longer right? He was getting a bit impatient too. I actually left mine in the freezer overnight\nto fully firm up and the chocolate in the fridge just needed a couple of hours when\nthey came out the freezer I was happy with how they looked, they had held their shape\nand nice and transparent with the gummy bear and lemon and lime feel. The jelly one I was slightly happier with\nbut then I took out the chocolate ones and it went to a whole new level. The playstation one, the Nintendo and the\nmega drive they were all looking absolutely incredible. Oh my goodness I think I put a little too\nmuch popping candy in that one right there, yes it has stopped but when you slice it down\nthe middle they are looking awesome. So there we go homemade nostalgic video game\ncontrollers and remember with these moulds you can put them in the oven fridge and freezer\nso let me know down below what you would do with yours. Also down below is a link to where I got this\nif you are eagle eyed you would notice there are actually 2 halves to this I want to keep\none, but this half here can go to you. So leave a comment down below, anything and\nI will pick a random winner and send the mould to you just like the square egg video, but\nI will clean it.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;50Omig63ifk&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hello and welcome to couch and Cracker Jacks today I'm going to show you how to make perfect spritz cookies every time now these are fairly traditional for most families around the holidays but some people kind of struggle with these a little bit so let me take all the guesswork out of it for you and show you how to make perfect spritz cookies every time these they need central need so let's get started I'm going to start off using a large bowl here and I've got two sticks of softened butter in there this is unsalted butter and to that I'm going to add in two thirds of a cup of white granulated sugar and using a spoon I'm just going to cream these two together now I'm using a wooden spoon here obviously as you can see but if you want to use a stand mixer or an electric hand beater go ahead and use that but this is a fairly simple dough so I'm just going to use the spoon and bowl and once that comes together and you've mixed that for about a minute to kind of dissolve a little bit of that sugar into the butter you want to add in two large egg yolks these are just the yolks here as well as two teaspoons of milk use whatever percentage that you want this is actually going to keep our dough nice and smooth and easy to work with I'm also going to add in two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract as well as half a teaspoon of pure almond extract this is going to get those spritz cookies the traditional almond flavor it's just a little hint of almond flavoring you could leave that if you want to or if you want to do lemon spritz you could do that and then just using my spoon again I'm going to slowly mix this together until it is incorporated and once that comes together I'm going to add in my all-purpose flour also known as plain flour outside of the United States as well as a quarter of a teaspoon of salt now I know somebody's going to ask me if you could use self-rising flour do not use plain flour you don't want any leavening in this dough whatsoever that's going to kind of distort your cookies and make your cookies have kind of funny shapes they're not going to stay in the shape that you press them out in so just use plain flour for this and you want to slowly work that flour and salt into your wet ingredients until it comes together and forms a dough now once that dough came together I divided this up into three separate bowls here I'm going to color two portions of the dough one red and one green and use one just plain white you just leave a light but to the green one I'm going to add three drops of America's leaf green hashtag not sponsored and for the red one I'm going to do three or four drops of americolor super red and using a spatula I'm just going to mix this together until the coloring is evenly dispersed throughout the dough now before I press on my cookies I want to take a second here to talk about the cookie presses if you do not have a cookie press and want to buy one this plastic one here is usually what you're going to be able to find in most department stores nowadays they have a selection of plates with them and they have a squeeze trigger type handle to them they work perfectly fine I really like mine however most people are going to think of this when they think of cookie press it's just your standard aluminum cookie press that everybody's grandmother used these also work just fine there's a little bit of a learning curve there but it's not too bad I'll show you how to use both of them here and that's when you actually turn the knob on top to press out your cookies but use either cookie press that you want I'm going to start off here with the new one the plastic one and to fill this up I'm just going to take small little pieces of dough and start shoving that into the press now you want to take small pieces here and press it down and make sure that you don't get any air pockets in your dough here and when you get it full go ahead and pick out a plate that you want to use I'm going to use the Christmas tree one here for this for the green ones go ahead and pop that into your end and screw it on and give the trigger just a couple squeezes until the dough just barely starts to come out and then we can go ahead and press out our cookies now I'm using a plain standard cookie sheet here this is ungreased and basically are you going to do for this cookie press is set it down on your cookie sheet make sure that it's sitting flat and squeeze the trigger once one press of the trigger equals one cookie don't worry your first couple cookies are always going to be screwed up so don't worry about those we want to space your cookies about an inch apart these don't spread a whole lot so you can put them close together and you just want to go through and press out all of your cookies until you've used up all of the dough in your cookie press now the nice thing about these new cookie presses is that they are pretty much foolproof and you can pump out a lot of cookies really quickly so if you're going to be doing dozens and dozens and dozens of spritz cookies definitely investment in one of these new cookie presses now if you're going to use one of these vintage aluminum cookie presses it is basically the same concept you're going to stuff the press full of dough make sure that there's no air pockets in there but again pick out the plate that you want to use and screw on the bottom and then take your knob and twist that down until the dough just starts coming out of the plate on the bottom as well and just like before put your cookie press down flat on top of the cookie sheet and with these ones you want to turn the knob on top the directions say a quarter of a turn I find just a little bit past that actually closer to a third of a turn now you're going to have to kind of play around with your individual cookie press these vintage ones every one is different so just play around with it and if you're having some trouble like I am here with your donut sticking to your cookie sheet could be one of a few different reasons a your cookie sheet is warm you need to use a cold cookie sheet B it could be that there's grease on there or see that you're not twisting the knob quite far enough but like before now would be the time to add your colored sugar and your sprinkles if you want to decorate these beforehand I'm just using red white and green colored nonpareils here and then you want to bake these in a preheated 350 degree oven for between nine and eleven minutes you want to make sure that they are baked all the way through however you don't want any color on them whatsoever and then let them rest for a couple minutes on the cookie sheet before you remove them to a wire rack to cool completely and then let your cooking sheet cool down and then you can press out some more cookies and continue baking but there you go hopefully I've taken some of the guesswork out of making these so go ahead and give this recipe a try let me know how you like it down below in

guys for today's video I want to tell you my secret method for getting rid of a pimple in 24 hours and I thought this is a request on Twitter and I honestly have been doing this for five years but I was thinking to myself why in the frickin ikan world have I not filmed this yet and then I realized like wow Cassandra you even need to get on top of things so if you guys have any requests be sure to tell me but this is a method that I have been using for the past five years to get rid of my blemishes overnight and I have to be honest this works about 90% of the time there sometimes it doesn't especially with cystic acne but if you have a big ol honkin Whitehead these are my tips and tricks for you and especially like before photoshoots this is what I would do and what I still do you know if something pops up really unexpectedly for a big event or for something urgent this is what I do to get rid of it in 24 hours or overnight so know that everyone's skin is different but this is what works for me the very first thing that you need to be doing it is shoving in that water you need to go to town with this water I am talking drink at least a gallon within the next 24 hours and it can be bottled it can be tapped whatever it doesn't matter preferably something that is alkaline balanced so that it you know helps your blood and doesn't have you know fluoride or the calcium or the mercury that is found in tap water but honestly hydration is more important than no hydration get that water going next it is time to attack that pesky pimple you want to apply an exfoliating face mask this is the one that I've currently been using this is the don't look at me from lush it has granules in it and today face mask that is meant to treat skin problems that also has some sort of grain in it this is what you want to use you want to pop this or a similar product onto your skin and let it sit the mask is going to penetrate to kind of break down the gunk that is in those pores and then as you step into the shower and start to wash this off that is going to help exfoliate off the top layers of dead skin normally I would suggest not taking hot showers because they can't drag the skin but in this case you want to take a super steamy shower the steam is going to help open up those pores and try to attack that pimple and when your pores are wide open when you get out you want to gently go in and try to extract that pimple now let's get something clear I am NOT you to pop your pimples popping your pimples is dangerous it can cause scarring and it can make matters worse and even more inflamed I am saying wrap your hands in toilet paper or tissue or get two q-tips so that everything is sanitary and gently lightly press on the skin maybe a centimeter apart on each side gently press on the skin and ease that little guy to come on out just the way the groundhog piques his head up a groundhog day and kind of looks around that's what you want to do to your skin you are not trying to do some NASA rocket launching here go at three o'clock and seven o'clock then go at like ten o'clock and maybe five o'clock and just try to ease that out and again if it comes out that is perfect gently push it through if it does not then it is not ready do not force it once you get that out you need to sanitize now I would recommend not washing your face washing your face could be great but it could also be a little bit irritating if you're rubbing that area a lot more I would honestly recommend taking a non alcohol toner something that is antibacterial and just lightly dropping it onto that area so you're not rubbing or excoriating the skin anymore personally love the pixie glow tonic I have loved this for years has witch hazel and aloe vera so it is healing once the gross passi stuff is removed you literally drip that on without excreting or irritating the skin with any rubbing you kind of drip that on so that everything is sanitized from there I like to make my overnight little acne mask this is a spot treatment that you wear overnight to fight the blemish this is where a lot of trial and error comes in you need to know what works good for your skin does your skin love benzoyl peroxide or does it dry you out does your skin love salicylic acid or does it cause more issues and irritation does your skin react really really really well to sulfur or does it give you an itchy feeling no button great is best for you but literally take your favorite spot concealer and mix in some pure aloe vera I would recommend taking the aloe vera plant and actually getting the gel you don't have an aloe vera plant getting some from Whole Foods its natural and jelly is what you should use pick these two products and mix just the tiniest amount on your hand take this with a q-tip and apply it onto the pimple this is going to act as a sealant to stop anything from entering an open pore and it's also going to fight the pimple overnight and any additional bacteria you're kind of using this as a sealant kind of like a liquid band-aid you know how a liquid band-aid goes over a wound and kind of seals it in you are creating your own anti acne liquid band-aid to wear all night long yes do you want to take a cold spoon that you have put in the fridge and just place this on to that area again do not sit here and tap on your head you don't want to irritate things but this cold spoon is going to help decrease inflammation and really just help close up and tighten the muscles around the skin which tightens the pore which allows this to penetrate deeper and kind of locks everything in then this is super important make sure that you get a good night's sleep take some time to relax before beds that you're not having super stressful dreams or nightmares and make sure that you are getting a good eight hours sleeping is when your body restores itself sleeping is when your mRNA and DNA are working hard to create new proteins to use for the next day and it is when your skin is rebuilding its blocks and really healing itself you're doing hormonal balance cortisol which is stress and acne control you don't want to mess that up make sure that you have a good eight hours of sound beautiful comfortable sleep when you wake up in the morning it is the big day I'm actually going to tell you not to wash your face we have this awesome acne antidote on our face you don't want to remove it and we don't want to irritate this area anymore now that we have gotten the comedone out we have decreased the redness and inflammation and we have let it heal it overnight the last thing we want to do is rub or scrub our skin promoting blood flow to that area which is going to puff it up and make it a little more irritated since it is pretty much almost gone of course you should be washing your skin every day especially if you're like me and you wake up from overnight with a sheet of oil on your face go ahead use a gentle cleanser but do it everywhere except for the pimple avoid the pimple and about a quarter radius on all sides and if this means that you need to wash your face with little cleansing pads then that's what you got to do but do not rub excrete or put anything on to that pimple area because the last thing you want to do is destroy all that hard work that your skin did it overnight that's the rest of your face is clean and ready it is time to put on your sunscreen your moisturizer and take on your day you can put on makeup but this pimple should be pretty much gone now if you did not pop too hard there should be no red marks or no scabs at most there should be a small open pore that is really on its way to being healed and again this has worked for me for about five years is work extremely well in the past years I've kind of perfected it this is my little 24-hour acne Buster secret and it's what I use so I really hope this helps you try it out tonight if you have a big event tomorrow and let me know how it

the focus find the focus you can do it you could do it did you do it I don't think you did try it again try and there we are boom okay let's start this thing hello my Valentines Spanky here how are you guys I hope you're having an amazing week this week I wanted to focus on a topic that a ton of you guys have asked me about and that is how to get rid of puffiness and dark circles under your eyes it's a problem that affects I think probably everybody to some degree no I got it yeah cameraman I most certainly do I have like no I don't even have bags under my eyes I have a full-on luggage like I am traveling wow I gotta take some of the causes for under-eye puppies our stress lack of sleep a bad diet weather sinus if you had too much to drink the night before if you were crying basically if you're human if you're a bot or a super human and you never get under I puppies then I loathe you dark circles are caused by some of those factors but they're also caused by the thinning of the skin underneath your eye the blood vessels underneath which have that bluish color are showing through I'm probably to sound like a broken record because I say this so often but one of the first things that you could do to counteract puffiness is water drink more water the more water you drink the less water you're going to retain therefore your under eyes aren't going to retain as much you also want to consider your salt intake salt naturally is going to dehydrate your body and make it cling to every little bit of water that comes in and create bloatedness and more puffiness getting consistent sleep is very important if you can at least go to bed around the same I'm every evening that's going to do wonders to help regulate your sleep make sure it's restful you can also try sleeping on two pillows that will elevate your head and help drain any of the extra water retention from your face and try changing your sheets and your pillowcase every week dust pet dander all kinds of allergens can collect there and can be affecting you while you're sleeping and you don't even know it okay so let's say you got a good night's sleep you wake up in the morning you look in the mirror it's still like a puffy mess going on the dark circles are just craters of badness craters of badness every morning you okay there you go here's something you can try make green or black tea now green tea has the health benefits so go ahead and drink it and then after you steeped two teabags you want to set them aside to cool you can put it in the refrigerator to do it more quickly and then you're gonna place the teabags over your eyes while you're laying down and let them sit there for about five to ten minutes this is going to allow the caffeine from the teabags to constrict the blood vessels which is going to reduce swelling and inflammation when you guys first wake up don't rub your eyes if I don't rub your eyes any time throughout the day you're also wearing out the thinnest layer of skin on the body which is under the eyes and the more that you irritate it stretch it pull it rub it the thinner it's going to be and the dark circles are going to become much more present cameraman do you like cucumbers Oh well shame on you because they're amazing for your eyes really yes who wants a cameraman makeover that would be hard to do being that no one's ever seen your face good like do a makeover where it's just the back of your head showing I'm like cameraman is totally quiet on this idea you've heard cucumbers are great over your eyes you see it done in salons cucumbers have astringent properties that actually help to reduce swelling and they kind of tighten the skin they also are great for reducing wrinkles and fine lines and brighten your skin tone you say potato I say potato whatever you guys say just like the cucumber the potato can reduce puffiness it the starch properties in potatoes our anti inflammatory who would have thought if you don't want to have to put hoodies on yo Faye's then you can try using a couple of spoons just throw some spoons in your refrigerator and then you can just place those spoons over your eyes for a few minutes this is actually something that I do quite often especially right before a shoot if I don't have time to smear food on my face photo damage from the Sun is a major culprit especially for dark circles because basically when you're damaging the skin you're lessening the collagen and sending out those layers therefore the blood vessels are going to show through so you guys it is so important to make sure you are diligent about wearing your sunscreen anytime that you're going out it is so hot it is like 90 degrees in here and it is like 11:30 at night this doesn't make any sense any time you are touching around your eye area use your ring finger it's the softest pad and the weakest finger so it's going to apply the most gently my ring finger lifts weights yeah I bet it does prove it dude that looks bad it looks like I'm flipping you off and I'm not I'm just giving you ring finger love make sure you guys remove your makeup every night before you go to sleep I don't care how tired you are makeup can get in there and clog pores overnight and cause your pores and everything to swell and expand then you're gonna wake up with a mess yeah I told you take off your makeup another cool trick I like to do take a paper towel and get it wet and then place it in your freezer overnight and then when you wake up in the morning you can take it out and let it thaw pause like pretty quickly actually and then you can just drape this across your face how does that look or underneath your eyes and it provides a great cooling sensation and also moisturizes the under eye area and of course makeup works wonders for concealing under eyes especially your dark circles you can also look for things that have reflective properties that's going to bounce light and make the area look fuller instead of sunken in and Hollow and also when applying your concealer don't put it over the entire bag you're just going to make the whole bag one new color instead put it just on the dark areas that you want to brighten and it will help even out the entire area and it look more flush if you guys want a shout-out make sure you hit me up on Instagram Facebook or Twitter I hope these tips helped you guys out reduce some of that puffiness and dark circles get them a rid of them that give it a gimmick get aa can't be it's late I'm tired it's hot cameraman is mad it's like 90 degrees in here cameraman cameraman is melting yeah he is I wish you guys could see this it's quite remarkable actually someone should drip you over a Sunday I have a little cameraman dessert I don't know what am i doing

I was a private chef I truly look forward to the holidays it was my job to create memorable holiday moments yet keep the kitchen clean and efficient I want to show you one my favorite private chef secrets I have one cookie dough many variations i want to share those tips and tricks with you so that you can create your own holiday memories so the basic sugar cookie dough is so simple it's just butter brown sugar and sugar cream together add in an egg vanilla and some flour so my dough is mixed and ready to go I'm actually going to lay it out on parchment paper and roll it up into a log or whatever shape I want to use and this can be frozen or chilled and we're ready to go a convection oven is your true secret weapon for baking the fans circulate the heat for even more flavorful results you'll never have to do the dreaded cookie shuffle moving the cookies around in your oven and you can fill up every rack when using convection you adjust your baking temperature down 25 degrees for best results so my first variation are jammed thumb prints I have chilled dough I've rolled these into a ball and I'm just going to put a thumb-sized indent in these and then I'm going to fill just a very little bit of jam I have apricot and raspberry whatever you'd like give this a quick mix and in we go these are going to get baked in the convection oven like all the other cookies so the orange cookies are just the dough with orange zest inside simple I've rolled this up into a square inside the parchment paper it's chilled and I'm going to slice this it goes in the oven and I'll put a glaze on top the orange glaze is powdered sugar orange juice and some more orange zest so the orange cookies are cool and I'm glazing them with the orange glaze for the cinnamon pinwheels chocolate hazelnut sandwich cookies and the macaroons I've rolled my dough out to a quarter inch for the cinnamon pinwheels I'm just sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar mixture onto the sheet of dough and then rolling it up tightly I'm going to then put it into the refrigerator to chill the macaroon topping is sweetened coconut whipped egg whites a little bit of powdered sugar and cocoa is optional for the macaroon cookies I'm going to take a chill disc of dough and I'm topping it with this macaroon mixture it's going to go right on the sheet pan and bake for the chocolate hazelnut sandwich cookies I've just flipped this baked cookie over and I'm going to spread about a tablespoon of the chocolate hazelnut spread right on here a little bit more I keep it centered and then I'm going to top it with another baked cookie and then just give it a little twist and these definitely need to be chilled so one holiday cookie dough recipe with many variations log on to chef Rochelle Boucher calm for all these recipes videos and more cookie baking tips&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;video_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;O4ErynMyZ3g&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hey guys welcome back to my channel so I'm going to be showing you how to make these super cute little bow rainbow loom rings and the good thing is that they only use three bands and three colors so it's super easy to make and even beginners can make this and the best thing is that it doesn't require a loom but I will be showing you how to make it with a loom and without so stay tuned for the very last Pro because it is super easy and who want to long one of these they're adorable so if you want to learn how to make these then just keep watching okay so all you need is just literally three bands two colors so the colors I have chosen is blue and one pink and then you just need your loom set up the standard way and then all you need is basically just three pegs and you want to turn it horizontal to you and then you just need your little hook so that is all you need for this and if you want to keep learning how to make this then just keep watching I have one of the three bands so this is the color that will be the actual bow part and then I'm just going to put it on two bands so that's the very first step so it's very easy and then the next one I'm just going to put it put the second blue one on the exact same one so now you should have two pegs with two of the same colored ones for the bow with the very last one so just put it right in front of it so that is all you have to do with that band so I'm reaching under the blue then I am going to pick up the pink so once I have it it should be underneath and then you just bring it over top of the blue again and then you just put it back on this peg so now you can see the bow starting to form out where the last part all you have to do is grab this band right here so the bottom pink one so just grab it with your hook and then bring it over and then just let it go now you have your bow but that's not it just take it and then you have to pull ever so slightly so it creates a knot so pull slowly and then it should create a knot and you can keep doing this so the bow doesn't fall apart and then taking it off the loom what you want to do is grab it with the middle from the middle go and pick it up and that's your bow so now this is what it should look like you can wear it as a ring and it looks super cute and if you don't have a loom that is okay I will show you how to do it with your fingers so keep watching okay so now you just need the same thing three bands two then the same color and one a different color and you're just going to take two fingers so this one and this one or any finger you want and you're going to wrap the black band around and do the same thing to the other one so now it should look like this and then you're going to grab your pink one and put it on this hand now if you watch the loom part you remember this finger was behind and then you're going to space out and grab the pink one right there so I'm just grabbing it so I have it and then I'm putting it on this finger so now you can see the bow part now grab the bottom one so the second pink one for my case then you grab that over and let it go now you have the bow and then just pull on it very slowly and carefully so it creates a knot and then it won't to let go now just take it off by middle and there you have it you have another bow so I hope you guys liked that tutorial and if you did please give it a big

professional, you know that brushing is not enough. If you just brush, food
debris and bacteria get left behind that can lead
to gum disease and tooth decay. Your patients have to floss. So let's review what we
know from your patients about flossing. They don't like it, they
don't do it correctly, and they tend to lie about it. In fact, a recent
American Academy of Periodontology survey
shows that over a quarter of your patients admit to lying
about how often they floss. Let's be honest. In my practice and
in most practices, the percentage of patients that
floss correctly and regularly is very small. I'd have to guess it's less
than 25% of my practice. That's a terrible,
terrible statistic. They'll have stacks and
stacks of free floss that I've given them for years,
and they're not using it. But they will use
the Water Flosser. The WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser is
the modern way to floss. When I'm done, my teeth
feel squeaky clean. Water flossing is the
easy and more effective alternative that can help
your patients end the lie. Just how effective is the
WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser? Let's take a look
at the research. In a study at the University
of Southern California, the WaterpikÂ® Water
Flosser was proven to remove up to 99.9% of plaque
biofilm from treated areas. You apply the WaterpikÂ® to
plaque on a surface of a tooth and you look with a scanning
scope and it's gone. It's simply gone. And that's unequivocal
and unarguable. In other studies, the
Water Flosser was up to 50% more effective at
reducing gingivitis compared to string floss
and was up to three times as effective as brushing and
flossing and up to five times as effective as brushing alone
for orthodontic patients. One recent clinical study
conducted at Tufts University proved the WaterpikÂ® Water
Flosser is more than twice as effective as string floss for
reducing gingival bleeding around implants. The Water Flosser is my
go-to home care solution for patients with implants. The Plaque SeekerÂ®
Tip, in particular, has been shown to be
up to two times more effective than traditional
string flossing. So that's really important. We need to stay on top of
peri-implant mucositis. We need to stop it
dead in its tracks. I don't take any risks
with my implant patients. They get Water Flossers. To date, there are over 60
research studies published in peer review journals
demonstrating the efficacy of the WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser. Dental professionals are
men and women of science. We need to respect
the literature and how it guides us towards
the most effective treatment for our patients. The WaterpikÂ® Water
Flosser is time and time again proven to be more
effective than the alternatives out there. That's why I recommend
it to my patients. The results are clear. In study after study,
the Water Flosser is unquestionably the easier
and more effective way to floss. But what about Air Floss? In studies published
in 2012 and 2015, the WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser
was compared head to head to SonicareÂ® Air Floss
and Air Floss Pro. And each time, the
Water Flosser was proven to be significantly
more effective. This demonstration
on an ear of corn helps to show why water
flossing is so effective. Manual brushing only cleans the
surface. An oscillating power toothbrush doesn't do much more. Even a sonic toothbrush can't
get between the kernels. But the WaterpikÂ® Water
Flosser thoroughly removes all the
debris within seconds. Since every single
patient of ours gets a WaterpikÂ®
Water Flosser, I feel like we are slowly steering
them on the right path to better oral hygiene
for a lifetime, not just when they're in treatment. The research has shown that
WaterpikÂ® Water Flossing is more effective than
traditional string flossing when used in
combination with brushing. Significantly more effective. I think a lot of that has
to do with the technology behind the Water Flosser,
but I think it also has a lot to do with compliance. Brushing is not enough. The WaterpikÂ® Water Flosser

how to create this super cute norwood bracelet this bracelet was sent to me by brett his instagram name is the underscore looming underscore center so you may check him out on instagram and give him a follow for me i will have his profile pick up as well i'm here's the front side of the design and it is reversible so you can certainly flip it over and wear it on this super cute side as well to make this bracelet you need approximately 170 bands depending on your wrist size and without further ado let's get started this bracelet you need one loom one c-clip and your hook we only need the two bar pins so you can remove the back row and have them facing in the right the our facing in every direction we want to be working with five pins and that would be one two three four and five so as long as you have a section in the middle between those pins for your bracelet to grow then you will be fine I will be using black turquoise teal and fuchsia today so let's go ahead and get started so I'm going to actually start with laying my teal band and we're just going to lay them going straight out without any twisting so I'll start on my right and then one on my left just like that and now we're going to lay going on the inside we're going to lay two bands which I'm going to start with my fuchsia so one on the left and one on the right so it should look like that it's pretty much making a double you push them down a little bit and now we're going to add on a cap band so it's just a double looped cap in on each pin using usual hook or just do it right here on the pin whichever is easier for you as long as it is wrapped around two times do that on the right pin as well sorry about my hand getting in the way so that's what it should look like so far and now we're going to go ahead and do one of the hooking steps first we're going to loop the middle bands back to themselves so we're going to go inside this left pin here pushing that double cap pin out of the way picking up the fish a band and bringing that forward we're going to do the same on the right side so get inside that double cap in grab the top band and bring it to the middle just like that now we're going to go ahead and loop the outside band so going back inside this left cap in grab your turquoise and bring it forward do the same on the right side push through the cap in grabbing that turquoise and bringing it forward just like that now I'm going to turn my loom around so you can see what I'm doing if it's easier for you you can certainly just reach over and loop it but I want you to see what I'm doing so that's why I'm turning it around we just want to loop these bottom two bands on this middle pin up and over so grabbing these two bands right here you're just going to bring them up and over into the middle just like that turn your loom back around to your errors are facing to the right push all your beans down a little bit and we're going to go ahead and add on our second layer so I am going to start with my turquoise again and we're going to lay our outside bands first one to the right and one to the left and now before we lay our middle bands what we're going to do and we'll do this for the remainder of the bracelet is we're going to bring these two caffeine's up and over now before we lay our middle bands so just starting on the left grab that bottom cap in which should be two bands bring it up and into the middle do the same on the right side grab that cap in and bring it up kind of push those down and now we can go ahead and lay on our middle bands again I'm going to alternate I'm not going to use future the whole time I'm going to go ahead and lay my teal bands so just one to the left and one to the right just like that and now we're going to actually turn - excuse me turn our loom around again because we need to bring those middle bands up and over again before we do anything else so on the middle pin you're going to grab the very two bottom bands and bring them up and over right into the middle like that you can turn your loom back around and now we're going to go ahead and add on our cap band which is going to be black again for me so remember if we just want this wrapped around two times one on the right side and one on the left side just like that and now we're going to go ahead and loop our colors back to themselves so going inside the left cap in we're going to push it out of the way grab the very top band and bring it forward do the same on the right side pushing back the cap in grabbing the top band oh that's not just happen so my cap band just actually popped off for me so I'm going to just quickly fix that if what happens to me just happen to you you can just remove the cap band grab that band pop it back on the pin it's super easy to fit and replace your cap band like so sorry about that so I'm going to go back inside my right cap and just I'm going to hold it grab the top band and bring it forward just like that now we're going to go back inside these cap in so we can loop our turquoise bands so going inside the left grabbing the only band left bringing it up put to the left one now repeat the same on the right side and bring that to the right so it should look like that turn your loom around or reach over whichever is easier for you and now we're going to loop the two bottom bands on each one of these pens so I'm going to start on the right side grab the two bottom bands and bring it up grab the two bottom bands on the middle bring those up and bring the bottom two on the right side just like that so now they're all in the middle turning my loom back around again push them down and we can go ahead and add on our next layer again so again I'm always going to be using my turquoise for my outside bands so I'm laying one to the right and one to the left and remember now we want to bring those cap bands over before we do anything else so starting on the left I'm going to bring that out and I'm doing the same on the right side just like that pushing it down just a little bit and now we're going to add on our metal band so I'm going back to my fuchsia and it doesn't really matter if you lay the left first or the right I would just stay consistent so you don't you know mess up consistency is what keeps usually everyone on track so now that we've done that we do need to loop the bands on back here up and over before we do anything else so once again you can either reach back here and pull them over or turn your loom around so I'm going to grab the two bottom bands just on the middle and bring them up turning my loom back around we're going to now add our copying going again making sure they're double looped and then my hand gets in the way when I do my cat beans it always does so I'm sorry but that's all I did was added my toque a pins on and now I'm just going to loop the middle back to themselves and then the out ones back out so I'm going to push my left cap in out of the way grab that top and carefully making sure not to lose the cap band enter the same on the right side grab that very top band and pull it forward now we're going to do our turquoise or outside bands bringing them back to themselves as well just like that turn your loom around now we're going to bring the bottom two up and over again on each pin starting from the left now in the middle bringing those two bands up and on the right side just like that turn your loom back around with the air is facing to the right push your bands down and we're going to do that all over again so I definitely feel like just like any bracelet once you start doing it a few times it definitely definitely is pretty simple to pick up on it's just remembering to keep bringing those bands over so I did lay my two outside bands so now we have to bring the cap pin up and over just like that and now we can go ahead and add our metal bands since I'm alternating I'm going back to my teal for me this was the most trickiest part because I kept forgetting to want to bring those bottoms up so now this is where you want to reach back here return your loom around I'm just going to reach this time grab the two bottom bands on that middle pin here and bring them up and over just like that and it's time to add our cap bands on again so double-loop those cat bands just like that and now we can go ahead and bring them back to the middle rubbing the top and now doing the right side and now going back in the cap bands and bringing the outsides out just like that I'm going to turn my limb around and bring the two bottom bands up and over once again on all three of these pens just like that turn it back around with the air is facing to the right push your bracelet down and we'll repeat that again so I'm just going to keep doing it a few times without repeating this steps just follow along in case you haven't picked up the steps already okay so I feel like I've done it enough times till you guys could definitely pick up on the pattern and I wanted to show you how it's growing at the bottom so you definitely want to just come down here give it a nice tug you can start seeing that awesome design forming I absolutely love how this turns out with the little like - looking things on the side and how it comes together in the middle and the back looks super cool as well so anyway I am going to go off-camera to finish up the length of my bracelet if you have any troubles please watch the previous instructions and I will come back at the end and show you how to close it up together I'll be right back alrighty guys so I did go ahead and finish up the length of my bracelet so now we can go ahead and get it closed up together just make sure that you did the very less last step that you would do before restarting that process all over again so you're lifted look like this you should have your two captains in the front which would be two bands so the two caffeine's here and then in the back they should all be looped so there should be two bands on each of these three pins so it should look just like that and if it looks like that we can go ahead and get a close job the first thing that we are going to do is bring these two outside bands into the front here so I'm just going to start on my right side lifting these two bands off of this top right pin and we're just going to carefully remove them and bring them forward like that doing the same thing on the left side grabbing these two and bringing them forward just like that so now we are down to three pins we're going to take one band I'm going to use the same color that I was using for my cap bands and we're just going to wrap it around all three of these pins right here so just one single band stretched around all three of these we're going to now bring the bottoms up and over on each of the pins so I'm going to start in the back bring that forward we have four bands on the front two because we have that cap band on the bottom if you cannot grab all four you can certainly describe to at a time I like to grab the top two first and then bring those over and then grab the bottom two bring those over doing the same on the right side as well so now you should be left with one single band on all three of these pins and now we're just going to bring these top or bottom to up to this top one it doesn't matter which side you start on first just be careful not to lose any of your bands I'm going to turn my loom around and this is where we are going to attach our c-clip there's the total of three bands on this pin here so just slide your hook down in there and I recommend doing this part on the loom it's just a little bit easier for this design slide you see clip one and pop it off the loom just like that and this bracelet I meant to tell you does curl up but it wears very nice when you have it on so just give your bracelet a nice little stretch I think it's a super cute look in here it is before I clip it so it is reversible and I did have a band break I've never had that happen to her to her before but I fixed it so it's barely noticeable but yeah so come down here to the other side and I just grab these two bands right here at the very end and clip it on like so and there you have D complete it Norwood bracelet just zoom out here a little bit there we go so there you have the completed Norwood bracelet I love this design I'm super glad Bret was kind enough to let me do this tutorial again as I just stated this is the design created by Brett also on instagram as the or the or SCOR looming underscore center so definitely credits to him for this awesome design give him a follow for me and hopefully you guys like it as much as I do once again it is reversible so there's the back side but

so just just to give you where we're at I primed all my pieces guide coded even block them all out two times so I got really nice surfaces to put my paint job down at Walmart so I'm preparing now to get ready for my exterior paint job but I do have the inside tunnel of the tank in the inside of my fender that I want to take care of same with my rear fenders over here out of the line of the camera so what I've done is they it's already been primed with some anti corrosive primer I took a red scuff pad like this I scuff pad at the inside I do have the area in here where where I had welded the brackets of a fender so I'm going to put a little seam sealer in there and then these pieces I'm going to put some tape and some paper on the outside of them and I'm just gonna flat block the inside of this because my paint job is gonna be black but I just want to have this be clean I don't really want to get into spending a whole lot of time putting down base coat clear coat and everything on the inside of a fender that nobody's ever gonna see it just never really made any sense to me but I am gonna tape it off and I'm gonna trim block it so it's got a nice you know semi-gloss kind of blacked look on the inside same with the inside of my tunnel so I'm gonna tape this off I'm gonna get that stuff primed up and then after that setup I'll get things get my garage prep I'll get my my jigs in here and everything I'll get my defenders and tank mounted and get ready for paint at that point I'll come back on and I'll show you what I've done where I'm at and then we'll I will put the black base coat down okay folks so here I am with my parts what I did was I sprayed the inside of these pieces with some trim black it just gives it a satin black finish it's nice and quick and easy cleans everything up I'm gonna paint my gloss black on the outside this will be not really visible but when you look under there and it'll look very acceptable I'm gonna grab the camera I'll show you what's going on yeah this is my Connell and everything here this is the inside of my fender you can see here where I am where I spread my seam sealer where I did my welding just kind of cleans the air this is my back fender here you can see I just kind of blacked out the inside of it but now that I have that done I'll let this dry pretty good I'm gonna prep my garage and get my get ready to put all of these items that I'm gonna paint on on fixtures on stands so that I get it painted well once I have that set I'll come back and go through the whole paint process with you we'll get some base coat on these today okay so I'm back I've got my my garage has been blown out it's all I wet the floor down on all the edges of the walls and nooks and crannies and everything with a hose seal the dust down I took my bench here I covered it with masking paper on my fixtures that I have my fenders on a couple of those with masking paper I've taken my fenders and got him wall-mounted and everything what I did just for a last-minute precaution was I took a red scuff pad and I went quickly over my fenders next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some compressed air mate in the air hose and I'm gonna blow all of my fixture my fenders all the little nooks and crannies make sure that that blow out all the dust or maybe even a little bit of water or something that might have been in there and I what's Anthon I'm things of that nature so I'll get that all squared away then I will do wash it with some pretty cleaner and at that point I'll be pretty much ready to go I'll get my gun all set my pink ball set and then we'll put some base to this tape folks so I get everything blowing off I washed everything with pre cleanup looked it over really good I'm good to go so I've got my garage all set what closed up lights are on I'm going to turn the exhaust fan on I've got my gun set up I got my face coat I'll show you everything and give me a little close-up of what I got going on here okay so here's my tank I got it set up on this jig and I've done this in the past it just kind of works so good I put it on this 2x4 and then I attach it with screws on one end I just let it sit on the other end what I can actually do here is I can take this tank and I can flip it like this so I can actually get my bottom side really good if I want to okay and then I can flip it back like that so it's like that so kind seesaws back and forth so I've got that set up over here I've got my Fender on my jig that I have made here and I got my other fender on this jig I got my my spray gun and I got my base coat so I've mixed up my base coat this is uh this is Sherwin Williams dimension the mixin mixing ratio is two parts of the base one part of the reducer I'm going to put down two to three medium coats on the on the surface I'm going to tap these pieces off I'm gonna get my fan gun and get my paint strained into the gun and I want to put a coat of base on here now the idea is not to try and cope not to cover your piece in one color okay we've just put an even coat on it you've got to be able to see through it don't don't panic look down on you don't want this to flash depending upon your environment I mean worried about seventy-five eighty degrees here which is pretty much perfect I'll let it flash for probably ten to fifteen minutes you'll notice it a little matte flat finish once you get that you know just keep an eye on when you finish your cup when you've finished your the last of your application wait 10 15 minutes put another coat on three coats you should be covered once you are done or you think you're done with your third coat what I would recommend is like that flash go around look at all of your edges bottom sides undersides everywhere to make sure you don't have any areas that don't have enough paint because once you put the clear on it you're done otherwise you start the whole process all over again so five or ten minutes so check for any areas that are covered take your gun just dust in those areas it's going to make a big difference because it's happened to every painter you paint something also you got a little or something after it's all said and done because he didn't hit it in a certain angle and now you know what is sitting it doesn't have enough paint on it and you're screwed you gotta sand the whole thing down and paint it again so don't get caught with that make sure you check your edges I'm going to apply this base coat and I'll come back on afterwards and it will talk about clear coat</span></div></div>

fins at home so what you see on the screen is my first attempt and you can see it looks pretty good actually almost factory finish so you can achieve this at home with some basic tools some patience and a little bit of talent okay so if you want to know how to get this done stick around all the details so if you want to achieve some decent professional results you really need to tear the engine down to do this properly so we did this to my brother Sportster when we were planning to upgrade the engine anyway so it needed to be reborn from 883 to 1200 cc so it was a good point to do this so I tore the engine down and then I could clean all of the components and basically get to everything quite easily as usually with me I have an idea and then I have to work on reverse engineering and planning and testing on how I get there so my first plan here was to grind the fins down with a grindstone but that didn't really work because the grindstone just specially kept on skipping across the surface and leaving a horrible marred finish so that was a no-no so I then moved on to trying a sanding block and a small flat wheel but the flat wheel also didn't work as well because it left a textured chatot finish because it was also bouncing across the surface and eventually out of desperation that's how you discover this stuff I went out and I bought a powerful a small cheap tool that has a small sanding belt that you can change the grid sizes on the belt so you can start of course and then go slowly increasing the grid size to get a smoother finish so that's how I then started sanding these and this the the profile was perfect for the job because I could get into all the small nooks and crannies you can see you they before and after and the idea was to send the fins first then get the cylinders steam blasted not sandblasted but scheme lasted and then paint them okay so that's what you'll see in the next couple of pictures here I'm disassembling the valves getting all of that out because the heads of course need to be blasted you don't want to leave these the valves in and you can see they're powerful did a good job these are the cylinders after they'd been blasted again seeing it perfectly clean now no corrosion left [Music] next step is to prepare the environment we're gonna paint and mask everything off but I actually do not recommend that you use duct tape like I did use high temperature masking tape because that tape actually lose itself on in the oven and but hey you gotta find out so Maho so but you can buy specialist high temperature masking tape for this sort of stuff and it's not too expensive so it's all masked off here and [Music] last up is two degrees everything with a degreaser from a paint shop products store and then I painted these with techline coatings T Ltd thermal dispersant paint there's not just your general cylinder paint it actually disperses heat so you've got to be really careful what you put on these especially the cylinder heads because you don't will just want to stop the cylinders from transferring heat to the environment you want to actually help them to transfer the heat away so that's why I chose that pain yes it was expensive and yes it needs to be baked in an oven at 150 degrees C but it is a great paint and it helps us the little shell heat so you can see here that of course I have painted over in the area that approves he sends it hot that was one purpose because the first sending was basically to get it ready and then now you just had to give it a light sanding to get back to the shiny surface you'll also see that the duct tape actually baked itself onto the cylinders which is what I don't recommend that you use it and so yeah use high temperature masking tape for the stuff you can see the finishes excellent now you can do this at home let's say it's quite easy to do next up clamp them in between some wooden blocks and then send them very lightly again with the powerful but and I mean very lightly just enough to get the paint of the previously highlighted fins and you can see it's already looks awesome and that finish has really held up extremely well over the years it hasn't corroded again and you can see it looks absolutely amazing that's a factory finish and you can achieve that at home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so what I'm doing here is I'm cleaning the cylinders and heads with soapy water warm soapy water yes you heard that right soapy water and then you once he done you blow them out with compressed air dry them and oil them so they put on rusticles and but that's what you need to do to get all the metal shavings out of there because you do not want those in your engine okay and that's the only way to really get all the crap out is with warm soapy water and decreasing and once it's all nice and clean and dry and the bores oiled so that they don't rust with their cast iron then I started reassembling everything and I put new valve stem seals in I used a valve seal driver to put some tape around the valves so that I don't damage the new seals because I may have sharp lips and then you put everything back together [Music] yeah I'm capping the new piston rings after the internet been bored out those are the new wise Co Pistons going in to bring it up to 1200 cc and here's the finished result doesn't it look awesome see you can achieve this at home just need a bit of patience and a bit of bravery to do this all right so thanks for watching thanks for supporting the channel if you'd like the video please hit the like

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Hey guys, itâ€™s Ro, welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies! It is summer time and it is really heating
up here in California so I thought, letâ€™s make a chilled Geeky Treat
today, so today we are gonna be making some homemade Game Boy Ice Cream
Sandwiches, letâ€™s get started! If you would like to make these super easy
mode, you can just buy the pre-made Ice Cream rectangle sandwiches that you find
at the grocery store. But Iâ€™m gonna be making mine from scratch,
so that I can make them a little bit bigger, to look like the actual
Game Boy size. But, if youâ€™re in a hurry and you want to
make some cold treats for summertime, you can just buy the pre-made ice cream sandwiches. So the things you will need to make these
from scratch, will be: 2-2/3 Cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, 2 eggs, 2-1/2
sticks of unsalted butter, 3/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of
salt, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Youâ€™ll also need a cookie
sheet and a piece of fitted parchment paper, and Iâ€™ve got a little lollipop
stick. For the middle of the sandwich youâ€™ll need
some ice cream, here Iâ€™ve got classic vanilla ice cream, but you can use
whatever ice cream flavor is your favorite. Then to decorate weâ€™re gonna
need green and black candy melts, and some M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s. You will also need a big
mixing bowl and a small mixing bowl, sifter, whisk, a flipper-flapperâ€¦. This
is called a spatula. And an electric mixer, now letâ€™s put it
all together! The first thing that weâ€™re gonna be doing
is scooping our ice cream into a cookie sheet, but weâ€™re first gonna line
our cookie sheet with a piece of wax paper, ooop! If you donâ€™t have a cookie sheet, you can
just use a glass pan, anything that youâ€™d like. I like the cookie sheet
because it is about an inch tall. And that is how tall exactly I want my little
Ice Cream Sandwich filling to be. And now weâ€™re gonna scoop, scoop, scoop! Come on now! Come on now! Come on! Oh my gosh heâ€™s frozen on there! Now that weâ€™ve got all of our ice cream
in the pan, youâ€™re gonna take a spoon, and smooth it over. Bewm! Now youâ€™re gonna pop this in the freezer
to re-freeze, for about an hour or two. And while itâ€™s re-freezing, we are gonna
make our cookies! The first thing that weâ€™re gonna do to make
these cookies is: In a small bowl we are gonna sift our flour and cocoa powder.
Now weâ€™re gonna whisk them together and set this off to the side. Next, in a medium bowl, we are gonna cream
together our butter, sugar and salt. I like to add my butter first, and then mix
it together until itâ€™s smooth, and then youâ€™re gonna mix in your sugar and
salt until itâ€™s evenly combined. Now that we got those all mixed up we are
gonna add 2 egg yolks, remember just the yellow part into our mixture. And then youâ€™re gonna add your vanilla extract,
ooooh! And then mix it up one more time until everything
is evenly combined. Now we have our butter mixture and our dry
mixture, and we are going to combine them, Iâ€™m going to add the dry mixture to
the butter mixture in thirds, and mix them up in-between until they are evenly combined. Got our cookie dough all mixed up and I just
put it on top of my counter. And I lightly covered the surface with flour
so that the cooke dough doesnâ€™t stick. And if itâ€™s a little bit crumbly, thatâ€™s
OK! This is a drier recipe, I love this drier cookie recipe because it compliments
the ice cream so well! Itâ€™s really good! So donâ€™t worry about the little crumblesâ€¦
You just squish it together! Now Iâ€™m just gonna pack it down with my hands
to be somewhat flat, and then grab a rolling pin, and smooth it out! Just rolled out our dough and now weâ€™re
gonna cut out our little rectangle cookies. Cut as many as youâ€™d like. Just remember
youâ€™ll need 2 cookies to complete your ice cream sandwich. Remove the excess dough around your cookies
and then scoop them onto your baking sheet. Got all of our cookies on the sheet and now
for that classic Ice Cream Sandwich look, weâ€™re gonna poke little holes on the
top. I like to start with three holes, and then
two, and then three, and then two and then three and then two and then three! While the cookies are baking (at 350 Degrees
for 14 Minutes), we are gonna make some decorations. We are going to make the screen on the little
Game Boy and some buttons. Bewp! While the cookies are baking, we are gonna
make some decorations. I printed out these two templates, and Iâ€™ll
put a link down below if youâ€™d like to use these, or you can make your own,
whatever youâ€™d like. Take a little tape, tape â€˜em down to the
surface, then youâ€™re gonna take this piece of wax paper and place it
on top, now we are going to trace and fill in our little designs with our melted
candy. In this plastic bag I melted the black candy
melts, and I put a number two tip at the top for a little bit more control,
and then Iâ€™m gonna use it to trace and fill in these little Dpads. Now we got our Dpads done, and now we are gonna
use the green candy melts to make our screens. Once your cookies have finished baking and
theyâ€™ve had plenty of time to cool, now we are going to decorate, my favorite
part! So over here I just took a few of the cookies,
these are gonna be the tops of the Ice Cream Sandwiches. And we are going
to attach our little screens and Dpads, and then our mini M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s, weâ€™re
gonna be using two little red M&amp;amp;Mâ€™s for the buttons. To attach the little details Iâ€™m gonna be
using some of the extra dark candy melts in this little plastic baggie,
as adhesive. So youâ€™re just gonna take one of these little
guys, bewp! And on the back put a little dab of your candy
melt, and then place it on top of your ice cream sandwich. Then weâ€™re gonna attach a little Dpad and
we got our mini M&amp;amp;Ms, for the little buttons. Then youâ€™re gonna do this to the rest of
your cookies! Our cookies are assembled and now I just took
out the tray of frozen Ice Cream, And now youâ€™re gonna take your rectangle
cookie cutter, and we're gonna cut out the middle of our ice cream sandwiches,
and this doesnâ€™t have a really soft, grippy top, so Iâ€™m gonna be using
my mitt, so it doesnâ€™t hurt your hands, and then you gotta put some pressure on the
top. Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee! This is called the jumping technique Then you pull it out, perfect, just like that! Then youâ€™re gonna place it onto a little
cutting board over here. Youâ€™re gonna cut out as many as you can
in the Ice Cream tray, and then pop these back in the freezer so that theyâ€™ll
hold their shape and we will assemble our cookies! Ta-da! Here are the Game Boy Home-Made Ice Cream
Sandwiches that we made today! I hope you guys enjoyed them, I love them,
theyâ€™re just like little, retro-geeky, summer treats to keep you cool! Iâ€™ll be posting lots of pictures on Facebook,
Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter! And if you guys make these or any other Geeky
Ice Cream Sandwiches, please take a photo and send it to me, I just love seeing
your baking creations. I just get a big kick out of it, it makes
my day. And, if you have any other ideas for any other
Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down
below and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright thanks again you guys, bye-bye!</span></div></div>

the dog piss out of your rims. Literally, and metaphorically. Dry the rim thoroughly with a clean rag. Tape off your bearings with transparent tape,
and block the threads that mount your brake disks. I was able to stuff it with random paper &amp;amp; plastic
that was laying around the garage cause after all, I am a professional. After you've prepped both sides, it's time
to get to spraying. Make sure you're in a well lit, ventilated
area, where the rim has no contact with the sun. The last thing you want is some asshole star
from 93 million miles away to fuck up your paint job. After shaking the can vigorously for a full
minute like it just told you your bike was slow, you're going to want to give it a test
spray on a piece of cardboard, paper, your cat, or your test piece of choice. For the first coat you want to start off with
a light coat of about a 50%-60% coverage. Much like spray painting, this thin layer
will help create a much better bond than if you were to disperse a full coat. Be sure to spray in short bursts, and always
move the can while spraying. After you let the first coat dry for about
30 min. Spray the second coat at about 95%-100% coverage. The main goal here is to apply the coat evenly
across the entire wheel. Allow another 30 min to dry. Based on your particular Plasti Dip project
the can may have enough for a fourth coat. Although I could've sprayed a fourth layer,
I decided to empty the can for the third coat for a thicker layer. Finally, to achieve an attractive shine to
match my bald head, and provide protection form the elements, I added 1 coat of Plasti
Dip Enhancer Glossifier. After about an hour, remove the excess Plasti
Dip from your tire. Contrary to what I've done here, I suggest
using painters tape for the chicken strips during preparation. If you choose not to, you can use something
like brake cleaner to remove the Plasti Dip that's too thin to peel off. Finally, take the time to pat yourself on
the back, admire your work, &amp;amp; Let it cure for about 8 hours before you install the tire. Alright guys so I think it came out looking
pretty fan fuckin tastic. I hope you guys got some kind of value out
of the video. If you did spread some love, like, ask some
questions, I'll respond. And, if you wanna see pictures I'm gonna post
some pictures on my instagram probably by tomorrow when I actually get it on the bike. But, yeah. Thank you guys for watching, and we'll catch
you guys later. Peace Alright guys that's... Alright guys, I hope you guys hahaha

here for the second time because it turns out I chose a name that was it's like one letter away from being the same thing as another rainbow loom bracelets name it was originally the love link bracelet but there's a bracelet called the love links bracelet so I am changing this name to the heart link bracelet so anyway it's in the tutorial if you ever hear me call this the love link bracelet just completely ignore me because I'm just refilling the intro and outro only so anyways don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and now without further ado let's get started so today you will need any type of loom you can also use a monster tail for this design but I won't be doing a tutorial on that since it's pretty easy to transfer the design you'll also need about 35 to 40 bands today I'll be using the rainbow loom comm silicone bands and the colors of metallic gold metallic silver and glitter white you will also need a hook I'll be using a metal tip took today however this bracelet does not cause any stress on your hook at all pretty much so you can use any kind of hook and you'll also need one c-clip all eye supplies today are from rainbow loom calm and now without further ado let's get started first off you're going to take whatever color you're using for your cap band and twist that on two pins so that way you've got a figure eight here and it doesn't matter the direction that it's twisted in then you're going to take your next band and this is going to be one of the links that connects the hearts together so whatever color like in this case I use this solid white so I'm just going to use this color and then hook over the bottom layer on both sides so that way you're left with one layer on the pins here after that we're going to start by making our first heart I'm going to be using my silver for the outside of the heart so you're going to take your first band of whatever you're going to use for the outside of the heart you're going to place it on this bottom on this left pin right here and then you're going to twist it to the left as you place it onto this pin right here so if I show you that one more time because it's very important the direction in which you twist it put it on this bottom pin and twist it to the left so that way as you can see the layer on top is this diagonal one we're going to do another band on these two pins here you're going to start at the top right this time and then twist downwards to the left so that you get something like that so as you can see the band that's laying on top here is the vertical one now we are going to add a horizontal layer of whatever color you want the inside of your heart to be and then we're going to do the hooking process so you're going to go over to this pin here and you're going to grab this layer and pull that over the pin and release then you're going to go over here and grab this layer and pull that over and release just like that and now we're going to hook at the two bands over here you're going to grab the very bottom layer and pull that over and on this side you're going to grab the very bottom layer only and pull that over as well and everything is going to be kind of loose that's totally normal then you're going to push everything down and now we are going to do a little bit of transferring you're going to use your hook and grab this one band here pull it off of the pin and then you're going to place it onto this bottom right pin here so don't be afraid to use your fingers for this just in case things happen to get loose and fall off or anything and we're going to do the same thing to the left side you're going to grab this band here pull it off of the pin and then carefully transfer it onto here make sure that this gold band here or whatever color you're using isn't twisted so that way you get something like this it's okay that these silver bands are SuperDuper loose so don't worry about that next you're going to grab whatever color you're using for the link that goes in between each of the hearts and put that right on top so that we get something like this and here's where you can kind of create variations of this bracelet after you finish making this one but for this specific bracelet we're going to grab the bottom two layers on each pin pull over so bottom two layers oops sorry O's kind of off them Center you're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull over on the right and then do the same thing on the left grab the silver and the gold layer and pull that over so that way all we have left is one layer on our pin and as you can see this is one heart right here so we're complete we've completed that heart and we're going to do our next one now so you're going to go on ahead and add on your heart bands again for the first one that we put on the left remember we're going to put it on the bottom one and then twist it to the left as you place it on that pin just like that and now we're going to add on the one that goes on the right side you're going to take one single band put it on the top right pin this time and then twist to the left as well again twisting the bands in the correct direction is very very important for this you're going to next grab your band that's going to go in the center and now it's time to start the hooking process for the left we're going to grab this band right here and pull that over the pin and release and then for the right we're going to grab this bottom band here and pull that over the pin and release so that we get something like this next for the bottom here we're going to grab the bottom layer and pull over grab the bottom layer again and pull over make sure you're not going inside of the band to grab that stay on the outside and pull that over so after that now we've got to make our two edges that go together so we're going to go here and pull this and place it onto here make sure you're not folding over the band's grab this top left pin and place it over here after that it is now time to add on our layer that links the hearts together and then we're going to do the hooking process so for the hooking process you're going to grab the bottom two and pull over and then grab the bottom two and pull over again and it doesn't matter you can hook the left side first and then the right it doesn't matter so now as you can see we've got two hearts so far that's basically what that looks like and then we're going to do the same exact thing again so I'm going to add my silver bands on the outside this time so you're going to start at the bottom left and then twist that to the left then we're going to go to the top right and twist to the left so that way the twists are like this so that way the diagonal ones on top here and the vertical ones on top over here after that we're going to add the horizontal band on top for whatever band's going to be in the center of the heart and then we're going to do the hooking process so it doesn't matter which side you do first I just like to do the left side first so you're going to grab this band right here and pull that over grab this thin right here and pull that over just like that now we're going to hook the bottom layers over on these two pins here so grab the bottom layer pull that over and grab the bottom layer here and pull that over as well so that way you get something like this after that it's time to connect these two together so you're going to grab this side here and place that on to this bottom pin just like that now we're going to go on this side here grab this band and place this band onto the bottom right here so that way you have the layers all together here you want to make sure they're all together before we add on our linking one the one that links all the hearts together and so for this we're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull that up and over the pin on both sides bottom two up and oak so now we've got three hearts so far so we're going to do the same exact thing again start on the bottom left and twist to the left so that way this layer right here is on top now we're going to go on the top right and twist to the left again so that way the vertical layers on top after that we're going to add the center of the heart and it's time to start the hooking process so for the hooking process you're grabbing whatever layers on top as you can see this diagonal band part is right on top so we're going to grab that pull that over and then here the vertical band is on top here so you're going to pull that over and now it's time to hook the bottom bands bottom bands pull over bottom bands pull over again push those down and now it's time to make these go on the same pins so you're going to grab this here pull that off carefully and place that on to this pin same thing with the left side grab this and place this on to the left as well so that way we've got them all on the same pins here now it's time to grab one single band pull that over and then we're going to grab the bottom two layers and pull over bottom two layers and pull over so that we've got something like this so far I'll be showing you how to do the hearts three more times so that's just to give you an idea of how many more times I'll be showing you how to do this again or not again actually I haven't said this yet but if you do have trouble with making after I'm finished you can always rewind and re-watch the previous instructions and yeah so let's go ahead and start on our first of the three so grab one of your border bands place on the bottom left pin and then we're going to twist it to the left then we're going to grab another band put it on the top right this time and twist that to the left as well after that we're going to grab the band that goes into the center of the heart and place it across the top two pins so that way you get something like this on your loom and it is now time to start the hooking process so we're going to grab the bottom layer here and pull that over and release then we're going to grab the layer here pull that over so that we've got something like this now with your hook you're going to grab the bottom layer on the left and pull over and the bottom layer on the right and pull over so that way you've got something like this on your loom now it's time to make all these on the same pins so you're going to grab this layer here and transfer that right there this layer here and transfer that down there so that way we've got them stacked on the pins together now we are going to go ahead add on this layer here so that way it goes across and then we're going to grab the bottom two and pull over on both sides and then we've got this heart here so we're going to do the same thing again pin on the bottom left and then twist up to the top left and you're twisting to the left on that then we're going to start on the top right and twist to the left so that way you get something like this then we're going to grab one of our horizontal bands in place that go in across and then we are going to do the hooking process by grabbing this and twisting grabbing this and twisting that over or basically what we're doing with the hooking process is untwisting it so that way when you got the heart bands here none of them are twisted so now we are going to go down here and grab the bottom band and pull over on both of these pins so that way you get something like this after that we're going to go over here and transfer these two sides down to the bottom two pins just like that so you've got this here then you're going to grab one of the chain links that links all the hearts together and then we're going to do the hooking process by grabbing the bottom two and pulling over on both sides just like that so you should have something like this now and the hearts are upside down right now but anyways I'm going to show you how to do the heart one last time and then after that I'll be going off-camera to finish off my bracelet and yeah so you're going to start on the bottom left and twist to the left as you place it upwards then you're going to stop on the tart tart right what you're going to start on the top right and twist that downwards or to the left and pull downwards I'm getting all tongue-tied today and then you are going to grab whatever color you're going to put in the center of your heart and take your hook and we're now going to hook these layers over at the top here and then we're going to hook the bottom layers over on the bottom pins here just like that now we are going to transfer the top to down to the bottom two so grab that pull that down wrap this pull this down as well and then to finish off the heart we're going to add a link that connects the hearts all together bottom to pull over and bottom to pull over so when you're finished you should get something like this and you may have bands that are twisted a little bit so that way they get kind of crazy in the links but you can always just fix that by untwisting so anyways this is what my love link bracelet looks like so far I decided to go for an elegant look with the metallics today but anyways you're going to go ahead and continue that same process until you've got a full bracelets length we're pretty close right now I'll probably only have to do two or three more hearts so if you're still having trouble then feel free to rewind the video and rewatch the previous instructions and follow along again if you're doing great then go ahead and finish off your bracelet or finish off the length of the bracelet that you need and I will be back to show you how to take this off of your loom okay so I'm now finished with my bracelet and finishing off this is SuperDuper easy all you got to do is grab the left side or make sure that you finished off with one layer on to the pins and I'm just going to grab the left side and pull that over to the right so that way I've got two layers on one pin then I'm going to take my c-clip and slide this on to both layers by the way I am using a large c-clip today because this is what came with my rainbow loom silicone bands which is really helpful in some cases when I do have a lot of bands on my pins but anyway just make sure your bracelet isn't twisted and then add the cap band layers at the beginning on to your c-clip here and that is how you make this really cool heart link bracelet so anyways sorry about the name confusion thing and yeah don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and also the subscribe button down below if you haven't already and find me on all my social media sites that are also in the description box below once again thank you all so much for watching this video and I will see you all in my next tutorial

going to show you how to roll the dough. First I divide the dough into 3 parts. So it would
not be too hard to work with. I'm putting the first piece on the table and just squishing
it a little bit so it would be easier to roll it. I'm just taking the rolling pin and rolling
it. It should not be too thin. It should be about half a inch thick. Once I finish the
first one, I'm going to do the second one to and the third one after that because it
is just more convenient to first roll all the dough. Then to shape it. Remember not
to make it too thin cause you would not be able to put the wooden sticks in. The second
one is done and I'm going to take the the third one and do the same thing over again.</span></div></div>

how many wavelengths are given off of a certain thing vibrant sees basically things with a higher frequency vibrate more or vibrate quicker things with the lower frequency vibrate less people who are on their deathbed and normally have a frequency between 20 and 40 Hertz which is very very low the human body generally functions better higher and that's why some people believe in the magical healing properties of stones because certain stones and certain rocks have certain frequencies and when some people wear those they feel like they absorb that vibrational energy that is obviously susceptible to the individual and I'm sure different people pick up on different things but roses rose water rose essence and rose oil has one of the highest frequencies I think it's around 250 to 300 which is scientifically proven that your body can rose water is wonderful because it naturally boosts up your frequency which makes your cells better at healing which makes your cells more prone to collagen production and which overall gives them a better foundation to build healthy strong skin so I am taking this and it comes in a spray bottle already this one's just from Whole Foods and I'm going to add two tablespoons when it comes to your rose water you do want to make sure that it's a hundred percent pure rose water you don't want it to be diluted with other things the reason that I'm using rose water instead of rose oil in this particular case is because I want to make sure that my solution is sprayable and not all oils so now that that's in it is time to mix this up once that is sufficiently stirred you can put the lid on and save it for later or you can put it in your spray bottle and start using it immediately this is one of my absolute favorite concoctions or recipes it really has saved a lot of my chest and back acne I started doing this about two years ago and I will never go back there are a lot of over-the-counter products that I look to but this is amazing and also when we're in the shower or when we're getting ready every day and cleansing our face in the morning and evening sometimes it's hard to get our chest on our back every single day so this is the savior and again you spray it on it's so easy so every single time you use it you will have to shake it whether it's in this container or in your spray bottle just because oil and some of the liquids will naturally separate but that's what it is and I really hope that you guys enjoy so if you guys want more DIY videos let me know what you're interested in post a comment about what videos you want to see and subscribe and give this video a thumbs up if you haven't already subscribed posting videos every Monday and every Thursday magical adventures of a crazy cat lady who also likes to create DIY scientific concoctions in her living room with an ugly old floral couch oh yeah we get real here thanks for getting kitchen e with me kitchen e creative witch gee thanks and I cannot wait to see you all in the next video love you guys bye</span></div></div>

be making a body skincare video and in this video I'm gonna show you how to get rid of back acne in just one week now the question when you always get in your mind whenever you watch any kind of video like this is does it really work and my answer to this is that it definitely works maybe for some people it will take a little bit more time than one week but for most people it will definitely show an improving result in just one week so I think it is definitely worth trying if you have back acne and who knows it might just really help you if you aren't already subscribed to my channel then please hit the subscribe button below and be a part of my skincare family where we talk everything about skincare also make sure to press that Bell icon because that's going to notify you the next time I upload a new video and I make new skincare videos every single week and definitely don't want to miss it right and without further ado let's get this video started so this is the back of my shoulder and as you can see there are a few scars from the pimples that I had which are now gone it has been over a week now and almost all of the pimples are slowly fading away I usually have a few pimples on my back and chest but whenever I include this simple step in my shower every day I don't really get pimples say from now on I won't be lazy and I'll make sure to clear this in my shower every day so if you are someone like me who's going through the same situation then you should give it a try because I think it really makes a difference all you need is an exfoliating gloves or a body brush and a shower gel and this detalle antiseptic liquid which is the main thing in this step you can get a pair of exfoliating gloves in your local beauty supply store or you can also buy it online through eBay or Amazon and it's actually really cheap now for the body wash make sure that your body wash is not too nourishing or moisturizing because the body wash that says it is deep moisturizing usually contains more oil which is not a good choice for people who tend to get pimples on their body too this is usually because some part of the body more oil and when it is mixed with sweat and dirt it creates bacteria which end up clogging the pores that later turn into pimples so do not use a nourishing or deep moisturizing creamy body wash and if you cannot find exfoliating gloves you can also use exfoliating brushes or some loofahs and try to use it every day in the shower I usually take shower before I go to bed or sometimes I also take shower in the morning if I feel like it or sometimes I'll just shower during the day if I workout and I always include this routine in my shower because I can see that it really helps because if I don't do it then I'm sure that it's going to show up on my back I mean the pimples you know so I always make sure to include this in my shower that is one more very important thing that you have to make sure to do and that is to never wear the same t-shirt undershirt first bra or whatever you wear that's the first layer touching your skin because throughout the day you will be spreading and your skin will produce oil too so the sweat and oil will stick to your clothes and it is already creating a room for developing bacterias and if you wear the same shirt the next day the bacterias that are in your shirt will travel into you're already sweating skin and imagine when all these happens and I know the way I explained it seemed a little bit too intense or too detailed but this is not my OCD this is the truth you know I think this is how scientifically bacterias travel into your body and create a mess I know that there are people who does not get affected by this because they are lucky to have a stronger defensive skin but if you are watching this then obviously your skin breaks out right so this is something very important that you need to change in your lifestyle so that you can fight against this bacteria and be able to have a pimple free back so make sure to wear a clean washed top every single day so summary of the video is to use exfoliating gloves or brush and use a shower gel and add a little bit of de taÃ¼ll antiseptic liquid in it and include this in your shower routine every single day and never wear the same shirt the next day even if it seems or smells clean and laughs we do not try this on your face don't even think about it alright guys that's it for this video please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and make sure to subscribe to my channel so that you can be notified the next time I upload a new skincare video if you found this video helpful then please share it with your friends so they can help them too don't forget to follow me on my Instagram where you can see

from the Wilton test kitchen. And I'm back with another
frequently asked question. We actually get this question
in all kinds of forms, a lot. People have a hard time working
with roll-out cookie dough. So I want to talk about
roll-out cookie dough today, and give you some tips
and tricks on how to be successful with that. The recipe I'm going to show
you today is awesome because it doesn't require any
chilling before you can roll it out to cut out your cookies. Super huge time saver
when you don't have to chill the dough down before cutting it. So this is the Wilton No
Chill Roll-Out Cookie Dough, I'm gonna show you how
to make it right now. So I have all of my ingredients laid out. And into my bowl of my
mixer, I'm going to pour my granulated sugar, with
two sticks of butter. And it's softened, so that
it's at room temperature, so that it can combine with my sugar really nice and easily. Use a paddle attachment,
just mix it on low speed. And what you're looking
for here is for the butter and the sugar to be nice
and creamed together. So they will be light in
color, and very fluffy, just like this, that's
exactly what you need for these cookies. Now to my butter and sugar
mixture I'm going to add one egg and two different extracts. If I didn't mention it before,
these cookies are delicious. So not only are they simple
to make and roll out, but they're also super yummy. To get that flavor I'm going
to add vanilla extract, and also almond extract,
so it's gonna have a dual flavor that's really awesome. One of my very favorite cookie recipes. So once these are nice and combined, we're gonna go ahead and
combine our dry ingredients. I have two and three quarters
cups of all purpose flour, and to that I'm going to
add one teaspoon of salt which is also going to
add a lot of awesome flavor to my cookie, and one
teaspoon of baking powder. I just want to give these
a quick mix together to get the baking powder and the salt combined into the flour before we add this to our butter mixture. And then I'm just going
to go ahead and add this to my mixer, about one cup
at a time, nice and slow. Make sure you stop your
mixer, scrape it down, every once in a while
so that everything gets nice and combined. So you'll see it starts to
get really, really thick, like cookie dough, and
you're going to, again, want to scrape the bottom and the sides to make sure that
there's nothing sticking, no flour sticking to
the sides, or especially to the bottom of the bowl. It can collect there, so
give it a nice good scrape to get all those dry bits up and into the stickier dough. And give it a few more
turns around the bowl until it becomes a nice ball. That's when your cookie dough is ready. And there you go, this
is what it looks like, see it's really really clumped together. You don't want to over mix the dough. So as soon as it starts to
clump together like that, that's when you wanna stop. Because the more you mix the dough, the tougher your cookies
will get because you'll start to develop the gluten in the flour, and that's what makes
cookies hard and tough. So don't over mix. When it starts to ball up like this, you're perfectly ready to go! Now we're ready to roll it out. So I'm lightly dusting
my surface with flour, so that my dough doesn't
stick once I put it out. We're gonna work with half
of our dough at a time. So just eyeball in your
bowl, about what half is, scrape it out, kind of squish it together, we wanna form a disc. And then flatten it down, just
like that, like into a disc. Make sure you always have a lot of flour underneath you, so that
this dough doesn't stick. But as you can see, I didn't
chill my dough at all, and it's very nice consistency to roll out and play with, it's not sticking to me, it's gonna roll out
super easily because it's not very cold, and we're ready to go. Gonna put just a little bit of flour also on top of the dough. And I like to give my rolling pin a little bit of flour as well, again, less sticking is better. You just want to roll
this cookie dough out, I like to turn it a quarter
turn, once in a while. 'Cause this again is going
to help prevent sticking. Now if you like thicker cookies, go ahead and roll them thicker. Your bake time will
just be slightly longer. But I like mine a little
bit crisp at the edges, so an eighth of an inch is perfect for me. You can see how nicely it's rolling out, not fighting back at
all, it's not cracking. And I think that's perfect. Great! So you want to make sure you
get it as even as possible so that your cookies
are as even as possible when you cut them out. Now you have your cutters ready. You can cut these into, obviously, any shape or size that you like. But what I like to do is dip my cutter into a bit of flour, in
between almost every cut. It's going to help the dough
to not stick to my cutter. Just press down, all the way down. Give it a little jiggle, and release. So the dough didn't stick
to my cutter at all. And the tiny little bit of flour that gets at the edge of the cookie
is actually going to help seal the cookie a little
bit, help it keep its shape a little bit better in the oven. So that's why I like to do that. So just dipping and cutting. And I'm going to cut so
that there is as little scrap in between my cookies as I can get. Because we can re-roll, and
we will re-roll our scraps, but the more times you re-roll your dough, again, the tougher it's
going to get because you'll be working the flour more. So I like to place them
as close as possible while I'm cutting, so I have
as little scrap as possible to re-roll. So now we need to transfer
these to our cookie sheet. And this can be a place
where cookies get misshapen so I want to give you some
tricks on how to do it. We want to remove, if there's
a lot of excess flour, brush it off. That's the first thing. And then remove the scraps around, you can put these back in your bowl, 'cause like I said, we can reuse these. We will re-roll them. So I'm going to use a cookie spatula to get underneath my
cookies to transfer them. Because that way I know
that they're supported the entire time from my countertop to my pan with no jiggling or waddling. Basically I haven't
changed the shape at all going from here to there. If you try and do this with your hands, your hands can wobble and shake. Which is fine, but that can
lead to a misshapen cookie. So that's why I'm using
this big cookie spatula to help me along. And then as I get to the
cookies in the center, oh, I tore one, it's no big deal. I'll throw it back in the
bowl and I'll re-roll it. You don't need to use
parchment with this recipe, it's not a necessity, but,
I like using parchment whenever I bake cookies,
because then I don't have to clean the pans in between bakes, so it's actually a real big time server. So that's why I'm using it today. So you'll notice I placed my cookies about an inch, to an
inch and a half apart, you do want to allow for
a little bit of spreading just in case your dough
is a little bit warmer than it should be, so that
they won't stick together. So make sure you do that when
you put them on your pan. Now we're gonna bake these in a preheated 350 degree oven for between
eight and 11 minutes. You just want the edges to
get very lightly golden brown. So we're gonna pop 'em in the oven. So now while my first
batch bakes, I'm going to re-roll the scraps of my
first part of the dough, and get my second batch of cookies ready to go into the oven. That way you're kind of cycling through baking and rolling and baking and rolling. And remember you still
have half of your dough in your bowl too, so just keep at it! Cool your baked cookies on a cooling grid like I've done here, and when they're completely cool, they
are an awesome canvass for all kinds of decorating. Check 'em out, they bake completely flat, and they keep their shape awesome. They look exactly like
the cutter that you used. That's why I love this
recipe, especially because it doesn't have to chill down
in the refrigerator first. So you can get the recipe for this No Chill Roll-Out Cookie Dough here, and please comment and

about how to protect your tank a lot of folks have tank bags and especially these magnetic tank guys have a tendency to stretch out the paint on your tank I don't do it I don't do this procedure all the time but it I do it my longer trips where it's going to be dusty and the bag will rub against the paint really cause scratches you do this for every day if you want so I'm going to show you what I do to protect my tank or even can be used on the side panels for saddlebags that kind of thing whether there's some type of contact with paint you can you can use this uses little trick if you love so as you can see these are pretty well protected the coatings that they had on here I don't know if they're high-tech or what but they're like a rubberized coating but still when you've got these magnets on there it doesn't hold the bag perfectly still so you got a chance for abrasion even when you clamp down these magnets they do tend to thunk and they they have a chance of nicking your paint so that's what we're going to try to protect against we're going to try to cover the surface and keep it from from getting completely messed up so fear the things you're going to need number one the sharp instrument I'm going to use my jackknife because that's what I'm used to use it exactly when I feel probably better a sharpie something pen felt it probably here's the heat of the whole thing this is clear contact cable used to call contact paper use it to like line shelfs with this particular stuff here says you can use it for covering paper type items what I like about this versus the old-style contact paper is it's reusable so if you're on a trip and you're going to be on and off the bike and you're not necessarily going to be worried about all the time to peel this off and save it and reuse it second thing that's good about having this reusable type paper it doesn't leave a horribly sticky residue on your tank it's a very light blue look it's enough to keep it in place but it works very well alrighty so we've got all our little pieces here we'll get our paper laid out think it matters which is which this is actually the plastic side of the paper that holds the plastic for you is face down and rolled up for a while so it's giving me a little bit of trouble so get our bag up here yes laid out pretty simple so you just want to go around trees it ain't got to be perfect in fact if you little fat with it just that much more coverage that you're going to have probably want to be careful that you don't get short be on your on your nice bag then I'll play and obviously pretty straightforward cut it up all lying around I was never very good at staying within lines playing coloring book session so excuse me if I'm not perfect with this now I use this for my tank bag like I said you can use your side panels side panels for the saddlebags concerned about that I use it underneath I have a front fender bag I put my tire to bag you use on the guy see our f250 it's a plastic fender and I do the same kind of thing for that to keep that protected and it's actually kept it just about brand new so you kind of get the picture here I'll get this get this punched out and then we'll we'll put her on the v-strom I can show you how it looks so now it's simply like pulling a part of detail and your weight on it Thanks the way you want like I said out of law a little large on how I did that ain't gonna look perfect it's just got to cover the surface that you want to protect so this bag actually folds up a little bit so I'm probably a little a little bit longer than I need to be on the back end of this see how I'm moving it around that's one of the cool things about this particular stuff I can take it off and click back on like I was saying before so you got that there like that now just lay your vibrate on top and you're set to go now there's probably some people out there saying how in the heck are you going to gas in there I'll show you in a sec so once again there's probably somebody out there saying how you're going to get gas in here because it's all covered up I'll simply just score careful that you don't park up your tank to score right around the gas opening this one has a key port also need to open that up actually you could just probably just peel the whole thing back because you know this area up here is not really prone to getting scratched we need to cut the whole thing out like I said ain't got to be pretty but now got full access to your gas area you got a good coating all the way around your tank like I said I use this for longer trips you can use it for everyday use but it all the magnets still still grip on and it gives you a really affordable protection against scratching chipping stuff like that if you're really concerned about that kind of thing some folks don't care it's a motorcycle that's going to get beat up and it's just clear plastic that goes over paper like this comes in a roll it's about three or four bucks a roll for like 50 yards or something like that you can get it in kitchen stores hardware stores grocery stores Walmart or whatever Mart you're living there you can you can probably find it there if you look so like subscribe share I appreciate you watching hopefully I didn't boria and adios</span></div></div>

virgin kitchen now have you ever wanted to make your own homemade nostalgic video game
controllers. Yeah you have, yeah you have. So a couple of weeks ago I ordered from America
these video game controller moulds and actually in that time one of my favourite youtubers
Rosanna pansino has actually used them too but they are really cool you have like a mega
drive controller, a Nintendo one and a playstation one. I am kind of gutted there is not an N64 controller
in there because I spent a whole Year playing goldeneye with 3 mates I really went awol
with that thing. So yeah it is a cool thing I did 6 different
versions of it and it actually turned out pretty darn cool. So this is what I did, I started with a nice
lemon and lime ice lolly themed one and combined sprite with lemon and lime chunks and fresh
mint. That was looking good I was excited about
that one. I went for a gummy style combo using some
haribo mix, so I went for the egg the gummy bears and a coke bottle, I put that into a
mould with some sprite, zingy times. Then I thought I would go a little bit old
school by making up some jelly or jello depending upon where you are in the World. So I made my mix together and then simply
poured it straight into my mould. And for a chocolate twist I melted together
some chocolate and did a peanut and M&amp;amp;M style combo in one for a nice kinky surprise filling,
and also using the melted chocolate I used some bashed up honeycomb and some mini marshmallow
pieces looking so good and that one surprisingly tasted good too. And a white chocolate one, but this time trying
to give it a white polka dot feel using some popping candy so popping candy and melted
white chocolate looking good. Now of course the hard bit is putting it in
the fridge or freezer to let it set now if you use baking chocolate that will set pretty
darn fast but if making the lollies you will have to wait a little longer right? He was getting a bit impatient too. I actually left mine in the freezer overnight
to fully firm up and the chocolate in the fridge just needed a couple of hours when
they came out the freezer I was happy with how they looked, they had held their shape
and nice and transparent with the gummy bear and lemon and lime feel. The jelly one I was slightly happier with
but then I took out the chocolate ones and it went to a whole new level. The playstation one, the Nintendo and the
mega drive they were all looking absolutely incredible. Oh my goodness I think I put a little too
much popping candy in that one right there, yes it has stopped but when you slice it down
the middle they are looking awesome. So there we go homemade nostalgic video game
controllers and remember with these moulds you can put them in the oven fridge and freezer
so let me know down below what you would do with yours. Also down below is a link to where I got this
if you are eagle eyed you would notice there are actually 2 halves to this I want to keep
one, but this half here can go to you. So leave a comment down below, anything and
I will pick a random winner and send the mould to you just like the square egg video, but
I will clean it.</span></div></div>

how to make perfect spritz cookies every time now these are fairly traditional for most families around the holidays but some people kind of struggle with these a little bit so let me take all the guesswork out of it for you and show you how to make perfect spritz cookies every time these they need central need so let's get started I'm going to start off using a large bowl here and I've got two sticks of softened butter in there this is unsalted butter and to that I'm going to add in two thirds of a cup of white granulated sugar and using a spoon I'm just going to cream these two together now I'm using a wooden spoon here obviously as you can see but if you want to use a stand mixer or an electric hand beater go ahead and use that but this is a fairly simple dough so I'm just going to use the spoon and bowl and once that comes together and you've mixed that for about a minute to kind of dissolve a little bit of that sugar into the butter you want to add in two large egg yolks these are just the yolks here as well as two teaspoons of milk use whatever percentage that you want this is actually going to keep our dough nice and smooth and easy to work with I'm also going to add in two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract as well as half a teaspoon of pure almond extract this is going to get those spritz cookies the traditional almond flavor it's just a little hint of almond flavoring you could leave that if you want to or if you want to do lemon spritz you could do that and then just using my spoon again I'm going to slowly mix this together until it is incorporated and once that comes together I'm going to add in my all-purpose flour also known as plain flour outside of the United States as well as a quarter of a teaspoon of salt now I know somebody's going to ask me if you could use self-rising flour do not use plain flour you don't want any leavening in this dough whatsoever that's going to kind of distort your cookies and make your cookies have kind of funny shapes they're not going to stay in the shape that you press them out in so just use plain flour for this and you want to slowly work that flour and salt into your wet ingredients until it comes together and forms a dough now once that dough came together I divided this up into three separate bowls here I'm going to color two portions of the dough one red and one green and use one just plain white you just leave a light but to the green one I'm going to add three drops of America's leaf green hashtag not sponsored and for the red one I'm going to do three or four drops of americolor super red and using a spatula I'm just going to mix this together until the coloring is evenly dispersed throughout the dough now before I press on my cookies I want to take a second here to talk about the cookie presses if you do not have a cookie press and want to buy one this plastic one here is usually what you're going to be able to find in most department stores nowadays they have a selection of plates with them and they have a squeeze trigger type handle to them they work perfectly fine I really like mine however most people are going to think of this when they think of cookie press it's just your standard aluminum cookie press that everybody's grandmother used these also work just fine there's a little bit of a learning curve there but it's not too bad I'll show you how to use both of them here and that's when you actually turn the knob on top to press out your cookies but use either cookie press that you want I'm going to start off here with the new one the plastic one and to fill this up I'm just going to take small little pieces of dough and start shoving that into the press now you want to take small pieces here and press it down and make sure that you don't get any air pockets in your dough here and when you get it full go ahead and pick out a plate that you want to use I'm going to use the Christmas tree one here for this for the green ones go ahead and pop that into your end and screw it on and give the trigger just a couple squeezes until the dough just barely starts to come out and then we can go ahead and press out our cookies now I'm using a plain standard cookie sheet here this is ungreased and basically are you going to do for this cookie press is set it down on your cookie sheet make sure that it's sitting flat and squeeze the trigger once one press of the trigger equals one cookie don't worry your first couple cookies are always going to be screwed up so don't worry about those we want to space your cookies about an inch apart these don't spread a whole lot so you can put them close together and you just want to go through and press out all of your cookies until you've used up all of the dough in your cookie press now the nice thing about these new cookie presses is that they are pretty much foolproof and you can pump out a lot of cookies really quickly so if you're going to be doing dozens and dozens and dozens of spritz cookies definitely investment in one of these new cookie presses now if you're going to use one of these vintage aluminum cookie presses it is basically the same concept you're going to stuff the press full of dough make sure that there's no air pockets in there but again pick out the plate that you want to use and screw on the bottom and then take your knob and twist that down until the dough just starts coming out of the plate on the bottom as well and just like before put your cookie press down flat on top of the cookie sheet and with these ones you want to turn the knob on top the directions say a quarter of a turn I find just a little bit past that actually closer to a third of a turn now you're going to have to kind of play around with your individual cookie press these vintage ones every one is different so just play around with it and if you're having some trouble like I am here with your donut sticking to your cookie sheet could be one of a few different reasons a your cookie sheet is warm you need to use a cold cookie sheet B it could be that there's grease on there or see that you're not twisting the knob quite far enough but like before now would be the time to add your colored sugar and your sprinkles if you want to decorate these beforehand I'm just using red white and green colored nonpareils here and then you want to bake these in a preheated 350 degree oven for between nine and eleven minutes you want to make sure that they are baked all the way through however you don't want any color on them whatsoever and then let them rest for a couple minutes on the cookie sheet before you remove them to a wire rack to cool completely and then let your cooking sheet cool down and then you can press out some more cookies and continue baking but there you go hopefully I've taken some of the guesswork out of making these so go ahead and give this recipe a try let me know how you like it down below in the comments if you like this video be sure to give a thumbs up I would greatly appreciate it subscribe for more deliciousness and to keep up to date on all my latest videos thanks so much for watching and we'll see you next

getting rid of a pimple in 24 hours and I thought this is a request on Twitter and I honestly have been doing this for five years but I was thinking to myself why in the frickin ikan world have I not filmed this yet and then I realized like wow Cassandra you even need to get on top of things so if you guys have any requests be sure to tell me but this is a method that I have been using for the past five years to get rid of my blemishes overnight and I have to be honest this works about 90% of the time there sometimes it doesn't especially with cystic acne but if you have a big ol honkin Whitehead these are my tips and tricks for you and especially like before photoshoots this is what I would do and what I still do you know if something pops up really unexpectedly for a big event or for something urgent this is what I do to get rid of it in 24 hours or overnight so know that everyone's skin is different but this is what works for me the very first thing that you need to be doing it is shoving in that water you need to go to town with this water I am talking drink at least a gallon within the next 24 hours and it can be bottled it can be tapped whatever it doesn't matter preferably something that is alkaline balanced so that it you know helps your blood and doesn't have you know fluoride or the calcium or the mercury that is found in tap water but honestly hydration is more important than no hydration get that water going next it is time to attack that pesky pimple you want to apply an exfoliating face mask this is the one that I've currently been using this is the don't look at me from lush it has granules in it and today face mask that is meant to treat skin problems that also has some sort of grain in it this is what you want to use you want to pop this or a similar product onto your skin and let it sit the mask is going to penetrate to kind of break down the gunk that is in those pores and then as you step into the shower and start to wash this off that is going to help exfoliate off the top layers of dead skin normally I would suggest not taking hot showers because they can't drag the skin but in this case you want to take a super steamy shower the steam is going to help open up those pores and try to attack that pimple and when your pores are wide open when you get out you want to gently go in and try to extract that pimple now let's get something clear I am NOT you to pop your pimples popping your pimples is dangerous it can cause scarring and it can make matters worse and even more inflamed I am saying wrap your hands in toilet paper or tissue or get two q-tips so that everything is sanitary and gently lightly press on the skin maybe a centimeter apart on each side gently press on the skin and ease that little guy to come on out just the way the groundhog piques his head up a groundhog day and kind of looks around that's what you want to do to your skin you are not trying to do some NASA rocket launching here go at three o'clock and seven o'clock then go at like ten o'clock and maybe five o'clock and just try to ease that out and again if it comes out that is perfect gently push it through if it does not then it is not ready do not force it once you get that out you need to sanitize now I would recommend not washing your face washing your face could be great but it could also be a little bit irritating if you're rubbing that area a lot more I would honestly recommend taking a non alcohol toner something that is antibacterial and just lightly dropping it onto that area so you're not rubbing or excoriating the skin anymore personally love the pixie glow tonic I have loved this for years has witch hazel and aloe vera so it is healing once the gross passi stuff is removed you literally drip that on without excreting or irritating the skin with any rubbing you kind of drip that on so that everything is sanitized from there I like to make my overnight little acne mask this is a spot treatment that you wear overnight to fight the blemish this is where a lot of trial and error comes in you need to know what works good for your skin does your skin love benzoyl peroxide or does it dry you out does your skin love salicylic acid or does it cause more issues and irritation does your skin react really really really well to sulfur or does it give you an itchy feeling no button great is best for you but literally take your favorite spot concealer and mix in some pure aloe vera I would recommend taking the aloe vera plant and actually getting the gel you don't have an aloe vera plant getting some from Whole Foods its natural and jelly is what you should use pick these two products and mix just the tiniest amount on your hand take this with a q-tip and apply it onto the pimple this is going to act as a sealant to stop anything from entering an open pore and it's also going to fight the pimple overnight and any additional bacteria you're kind of using this as a sealant kind of like a liquid band-aid you know how a liquid band-aid goes over a wound and kind of seals it in you are creating your own anti acne liquid band-aid to wear all night long yes do you want to take a cold spoon that you have put in the fridge and just place this on to that area again do not sit here and tap on your head you don't want to irritate things but this cold spoon is going to help decrease inflammation and really just help close up and tighten the muscles around the skin which tightens the pore which allows this to penetrate deeper and kind of locks everything in then this is super important make sure that you get a good night's sleep take some time to relax before beds that you're not having super stressful dreams or nightmares and make sure that you are getting a good eight hours sleeping is when your body restores itself sleeping is when your mRNA and DNA are working hard to create new proteins to use for the next day and it is when your skin is rebuilding its blocks and really healing itself you're doing hormonal balance cortisol which is stress and acne control you don't want to mess that up make sure that you have a good eight hours of sound beautiful comfortable sleep when you wake up in the morning it is the big day I'm actually going to tell you not to wash your face we have this awesome acne antidote on our face you don't want to remove it and we don't want to irritate this area anymore now that we have gotten the comedone out we have decreased the redness and inflammation and we have let it heal it overnight the last thing we want to do is rub or scrub our skin promoting blood flow to that area which is going to puff it up and make it a little more irritated since it is pretty much almost gone of course you should be washing your skin every day especially if you're like me and you wake up from overnight with a sheet of oil on your face go ahead use a gentle cleanser but do it everywhere except for the pimple avoid the pimple and about a quarter radius on all sides and if this means that you need to wash your face with little cleansing pads then that's what you got to do but do not rub excrete or put anything on to that pimple area because the last thing you want to do is destroy all that hard work that your skin did it overnight that's the rest of your face is clean and ready it is time to put on your sunscreen your moisturizer and take on your day you can put on makeup but this pimple should be pretty much gone now if you did not pop too hard there should be no red marks or no scabs at most there should be a small open pore that is really on its way to being healed and again this has worked for me for about five years is work extremely well in the past years I've kind of perfected it this is my little 24-hour acne Buster secret and it's what I use so I really hope this helps you try it out tonight if you have a big event tomorrow and let me know how it goes you have other secrets on how do you treat your breakouts overnight or in 24 hours be sure to share them with me so that we can swap acne tips and have clear beautiful skin literally if there is a genie in a bottle that's like one of my three wishes my second wish would

I don't think you did try it again try and there we are boom okay let's start this thing hello my Valentines Spanky here how are you guys I hope you're having an amazing week this week I wanted to focus on a topic that a ton of you guys have asked me about and that is how to get rid of puffiness and dark circles under your eyes it's a problem that affects I think probably everybody to some degree no I got it yeah cameraman I most certainly do I have like no I don't even have bags under my eyes I have a full-on luggage like I am traveling wow I gotta take some of the causes for under-eye puppies our stress lack of sleep a bad diet weather sinus if you had too much to drink the night before if you were crying basically if you're human if you're a bot or a super human and you never get under I puppies then I loathe you dark circles are caused by some of those factors but they're also caused by the thinning of the skin underneath your eye the blood vessels underneath which have that bluish color are showing through I'm probably to sound like a broken record because I say this so often but one of the first things that you could do to counteract puffiness is water drink more water the more water you drink the less water you're going to retain therefore your under eyes aren't going to retain as much you also want to consider your salt intake salt naturally is going to dehydrate your body and make it cling to every little bit of water that comes in and create bloatedness and more puffiness getting consistent sleep is very important if you can at least go to bed around the same I'm every evening that's going to do wonders to help regulate your sleep make sure it's restful you can also try sleeping on two pillows that will elevate your head and help drain any of the extra water retention from your face and try changing your sheets and your pillowcase every week dust pet dander all kinds of allergens can collect there and can be affecting you while you're sleeping and you don't even know it okay so let's say you got a good night's sleep you wake up in the morning you look in the mirror it's still like a puffy mess going on the dark circles are just craters of badness craters of badness every morning you okay there you go here's something you can try make green or black tea now green tea has the health benefits so go ahead and drink it and then after you steeped two teabags you want to set them aside to cool you can put it in the refrigerator to do it more quickly and then you're gonna place the teabags over your eyes while you're laying down and let them sit there for about five to ten minutes this is going to allow the caffeine from the teabags to constrict the blood vessels which is going to reduce swelling and inflammation when you guys first wake up don't rub your eyes if I don't rub your eyes any time throughout the day you're also wearing out the thinnest layer of skin on the body which is under the eyes and the more that you irritate it stretch it pull it rub it the thinner it's going to be and the dark circles are going to become much more present cameraman do you like cucumbers Oh well shame on you because they're amazing for your eyes really yes who wants a cameraman makeover that would be hard to do being that no one's ever seen your face good like do a makeover where it's just the back of your head showing I'm like cameraman is totally quiet on this idea you've heard cucumbers are great over your eyes you see it done in salons cucumbers have astringent properties that actually help to reduce swelling and they kind of tighten the skin they also are great for reducing wrinkles and fine lines and brighten your skin tone you say potato I say potato whatever you guys say just like the cucumber the potato can reduce puffiness it the starch properties in potatoes our anti inflammatory who would have thought if you don't want to have to put hoodies on yo Faye's then you can try using a couple of spoons just throw some spoons in your refrigerator and then you can just place those spoons over your eyes for a few minutes this is actually something that I do quite often especially right before a shoot if I don't have time to smear food on my face photo damage from the Sun is a major culprit especially for dark circles because basically when you're damaging the skin you're lessening the collagen and sending out those layers therefore the blood vessels are going to show through so you guys it is so important to make sure you are diligent about wearing your sunscreen anytime that you're going out it is so hot it is like 90 degrees in here and it is like 11:30 at night this doesn't make any sense any time you are touching around your eye area use your ring finger it's the softest pad and the weakest finger so it's going to apply the most gently my ring finger lifts weights yeah I bet it does prove it dude that looks bad it looks like I'm flipping you off and I'm not I'm just giving you ring finger love make sure you guys remove your makeup every night before you go to sleep I don't care how tired you are makeup can get in there and clog pores overnight and cause your pores and everything to swell and expand then you're gonna wake up with a mess yeah I told you take off your makeup another cool trick I like to do take a paper towel and get it wet and then place it in your freezer overnight and then when you wake up in the morning you can take it out and let it thaw pause like pretty quickly actually and then you can just drape this across your face how does that look or underneath your eyes and it provides a great cooling sensation and also moisturizes the under eye area and of course makeup works wonders for concealing under eyes especially your dark circles you can also look for things that have reflective properties that's going to bounce light and make the area look fuller instead of sunken in and Hollow and also when applying your concealer don't put it over the entire bag you're just going to make the whole bag one new color instead put it just on the dark areas that you want to brighten and it will help even out the entire area and it look more flush if you guys want a shout-out make sure you hit me up on Instagram Facebook or Twitter I hope these tips helped you guys out reduce some of that puffiness and dark circles get them a rid of them that give it a gimmick get aa can't be it's late I'm tired it's hot cameraman is mad it's like 90 degrees in here cameraman cameraman is melting yeah he is I wish you guys could see this it's quite

which is the journey which led me to create it and the lots of other details on the dedicated website at www.att.com/biz managers cosmetic line from the others apart from being vegan allergen free a gluten free and last but not least at the launch in the giveaway to celebrate the release of the cosmetic line in the next few weeks therefore if you want to try out some of these delicious treats for your skin just stay tuned with that said I hope you'll be curious enough to check out the website and please let me have your first impression I'd love to have your feedback now let's get back to today's tutorial you asked me several times in the comments left under my windows or under social networks to make a video tutorial on how to get rid of damages and fade away acne scars well I thought it would be useful to make a short series with some quick tips and tricks on how to fade away Agnes card mother nature fortunately has been very generous and gave us lots of alternatives to take care of our skin naturally total three episodes essential oils first aid vegetable oils first sit in vitamin C first day with today's beauty tips the essential oils first aid will learn how to fight pimples using tea tree essential oil and how to apply the way at least scars and dark spots using the lemon are and venturing attention holy tea tree oil is a great natural alternative to get rid of pimples thanks to its well-known antibacterial purifying astringent and healing properties as all essential oils to tree is a powerful oil which must be used with caution and small quantities just a few drops of essential or it will be people trade the skin and will live inside the pores helping drying out in Falls and their other blemishes I wish I were aware of its amazing purifying and antibacterial properties when I was a teenager it would have saved me lots of inferiority complexes to a knife or a few drops of tea tree oil onto a cotton bud gently grab the tea tree oil onto anything from but if for a few hours or overnight the redness and swelling should displease you just make sure to use 100% pure chest pain essential oil if you find that pure underneath the tea tree oil is a little too harsh or drying on your skin try using it in a homemade spot treatment I usually pour one single drop of essential oil in my daily quantity of cream or even better if you have at hand pure Aloha tile in this way the essential oil is limited and only be applied safely on the whole face or on larger areas well you can also use the tea tree essential oil also in your home weight on face masks or this crap for antibacterial action now that we have found out how we can prevent Olivos from breaking out it could be useful to find out how we can fade away magnet scars and dark spots most of the time some new scars will fade away on their own however there are some essential oils that may help them the fade away quicker the most known for their whitening properties are the lemon essential oil and the benzene essential oil but pay attention do not use the lemon essential oil during summer or spring time as it is photosensitive and instead of getting rid of the vanishes you'll find yourself to the new dark spots on your face the vented essential oil also known as gum Benjamin has not only great anti-age property but also helps you preparing and regenerating skin reducing redness and improving your skin appearance and providing relief from itching and irritation and that was all for today I really hope you have enjoyed the tutorial and that we have found useful sleep I wait for you next week with the second series vegetable oils first aid for admin issues make sure to subscribe the channel and share the video with your friends remember sharing is caring I'll be looking forward to receiving your feedbacks in the comments area down below see you next week bye if you want to make sure you don't miss magnified negatives just make sure to select the option email with new uploads' as shown in the video thanks for watching what different threatened what differentiates differentiate right what differentiates but different differentiates ciao</span></div></div>
