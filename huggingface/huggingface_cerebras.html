The complement to the master program is usually composed by courses at the Bachelor's level in computer science and/or mathematics. The total number of credits that have to be earned in the complement to the master program and the exact list of courses (individual study plan) are defined by the branch committee on a case by case basis at the moment of treating the request for admission of the candidate. These credits can be acquired in parallel to the master studies but before starting the master thesis.\nSince courses are mainly taught in English, sometimes also in French or German, knowledge of English is required; knowledge of French or German is a plus.\nIndependent which home university a student chooses, an admission request (from an academic point of view) is only treated once by the same competent authority, the branch committee.\nThese deadlines do not apply for students who are already registered for a program at one of the BeNeFri universities.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A Tribute to Late Professor Mahlagha Ghorbanli\nThis edition of IJPP celebrates ten years of steady publication of Iranian Journal of Plant Physiology. The story of IJPP is that of a journey that started from a local forum where the researchers and scholars mainly from the Islamic Azad University could share findings of their studies, gradually developing into an international peer-reviewed journal indexed by Islamic World Science Citation Center (https://isc.gov.ir/en) and SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank (www.scimagojr.com). We heartily appreciate numerous authors, both local and international, whose contributions have led us reach this far and look forward to more original research reports to move even further.\nThis edition is dedicated to late Mahlagha Ghorbanli, the emerita full professor of plant physiology in Kharazmi University, the first institution for teacher education in Iran. With her broad range of expertise and comprehensive knowledge of various research avenues in the field of plant physiology combined with a warm, caring, and supportive personality, professor Ghorbanli was the first Editor-in-Chief of IJPP, a prominent figure who was able to lead the editorial board of IJPP through the challenges inherent in starting a scientific journal.

Medical, Dental Societies call for professional judgment in pain control\nSusan Spencer TELEGRAM &amp; GAZETTE STAFF\nMassachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Dental Society representatives say they're concerned about the misuse of prescribed medications, but also call for regulatory balance that allows prescribers to use their professional judgment to provide care that's best for patients.\n\&quot;One of the unintended consequences is where you're so regulated, you're afraid to prescribe and people won't get the pain medication they need,\&quot; said Dr. Ronald W. Dunlap, a cardiologist and president of the Medical Society. \&quot;We all have different pain thresholds. Some people have terrible pain.\&quot;\nDr. Dunlap said the Medical Society was working with regulators to make the state Department of Public Health's Prescription Monitoring Program, a database of controlled substance prescriptions, less burdensome to use.\nHe also said pharmacy chains have extensive databases that could be used with DPH's data to identify providers who prescribe a large number of opioids.\nDr. Thomas Trowbridge, an oral surgeon in Lowell and a trustee of the Dental Society, said, \&quot;It's in our interest to promote the patient's appropriate amount of pain control.\&quot;\nHe said adequately controlling pain hastens the healing process and helps patients get back to work or school.\nThe amount of medication needed varies by the weight and age of the patient, the procedure performed and other factors.\nDr. Trowbridge said that anecdotes about young people receiving large Vicodin or Percocet prescriptions after having their wisdom teeth removed needed to be taken in context.\n\&quot;Often times it will be the first time for surgery where they've had to have pain control,\&quot; Dr. Trowbridge said. But also, many people who don't share their anecdotes have wisdom teeth removed without notable post-surgery prescriptions, large or small.\n\&quot;If we give them too few, it's been harder to call in more prescriptions,\&quot; Dr. Trowbridge said, particularly for Schedule II drugs including Percocet and OxyContin, which in Massachusetts cannot be phoned in to the pharmacy.\n\&quot;It's always good to have enough medicine ahead of time and prepare them for recovery.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaCommonCrawl\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The new U.S. National Defense Strategy: A \&quot;good deal\&quot; for the Military-Industrial Complex\nFeb 9th, 2018 +\nIn this article:defense, Military Strategy, Politics, society, United States, War\nOn January 19, 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis presented in Washington the declassified version of the United States' National Defense Strategy. In his speech, he made clear the militaristic approach that will be maintained in coming years: \&quot;This strategy expands our competitive space, prioritizes preparedness for war.\&quot;\nAccording to Mattis, the fight against terrorism will continue, \&quot;but Great Power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of U.S. national security,\&quot; which means a readjustment of the approach since the attacks of September 11, 2001. In line with the National Security Strategy of December 2017, Russia and China are identified as the main threats to the U.S. On a second level, are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iran, and the most dangerous non-state actor is identified as the Islamic State.\nThe document notes, \&quot;The 2018 National Defense Strategy underpins our planned fiscal year 2019-2023 budgets, accelerating our modernization programs and devoting additional resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive advantage.\&quot; In this sense, the U.S. will prioritize nuclear modernization, and investments in cyber and missile defense.\nThis the first time, in more than 15 years, that the U.S. has explicitly stated its interest in increasing military spending to maintain superiority over Russia and China, and consolidate its global hegemony. During this period, international terrorism served as the pretext for the strengthening of U.S. military forces, since after the fall of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the supposed threat that led the United States to exponentially increase its military budget after WWII, to the benefit of influential corporations, disappeared.\nThe language used recalls the Cold War era East-West conflict. The greatest exponent of the arms race was President Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 publicly launched the Strategic Defense Initiative, in which the scientific community was asked to develop a missile defense system to guarantee the protection of U.S. territory against a nuclear attack. It was also known as \&quot;Star Wars,\&quot; like the famous film of the time. As was shown that on that occasion, the only winner was \&quot;the Military-Industrial Complex.\&quot;\nThe current Strategy also reaffirms that the use of force will be applied as a foreign policy principle: \&quot;Reinforcing America's traditional tools of diplomacy, the Department provides military options to ensure the President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength.\&quot; In addition, it is noted that states are the main actors on the global scene, but that non-state actors, such as terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, and hackers, \&quot;also threaten the security environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities.\&quot;\nThe document emphasizes that the new strategy \&quot;articulates our strategy to compete, deter, and win\&quot; in this increasingly complex environment, stressing, \&quot;The costs of not implementing this strategy are clear. Failure to meet our defense objectives will result in decreasing U.S. global influence, eroding cohesion among allies and partners, and reduced access to markets that will contribute to a decline in our prosperity and standard of living.\&quot;\nIt is noted: \&quot;A long-term strategic competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of national power – diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military,\&quot; continuing: \&quot;More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength.\&quot; At the same time, it is claimed the U.S. \&quot;is open to opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based on our national interests.\&quot;\nLatin America and the Caribbean are mentioned only twice, referring to the Western Hemisphere, and unlike the Strategy of December 2017, no specific country of the region is mentioned. The objectives of the Strategy include \&quot;maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere.\&quot;\nAs outlined, the U.S. will deepen its relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries that \&quot;contribute military capabilities to shared regional and global security challenges.\&quot; The document also notes, \&quot;The U.S. derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland.\&quot;\nAlthough not recognized in the Strategy, it is worth mentioning that Latin America and the Caribbean is the most densely populated area in the world, and that more than half a century ago, it was declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone, through the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Last month marked four years since the 33 member countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), meeting at their Second Summit, in Havana January 28-29, 2014, declared \&quot;Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.\&quot;\nThis is the \&quot;civilized\&quot; world of the 21st century – some proclaim peace while others enact war. The Pentagon has revealed it is committed to building \&quot;a more lethal force,\&quot; in clear defiance of international peace, and to justify its 700 billion dollar military budget for 2018.\nThe Strategy defends President Donald Trump's nationalist electoral platform of \&quot;America first,\&quot; which combines diplomatic isolationism and economic protectionism, with military reinforcement and the denial of the threat of climate change. A \&quot;novel\&quot; formula to try to maintain global hegemony, and another \&quot;good deal\&quot; for the Military-Industrial Complex.\n2016 NATO spending by country with percentage of total\nIn

It chronicles the life of Teresa Lohan, from her youth in rural Ireland in the 1940s through her time in New York and her return to Ireland in her sixties. Tess is seemingly unremarkable, both as a child and an adult: a shy, sensitive child; a woman with an essential loneliness (\&quot;It seemed at times that she was marooned on an island, a moat of water, wide and black, separating her from all human love.\&quot;); a mother who feels she could have done better. Nonetheless, Costello's exquisite prose conveys this life with such emotion, such care, that the reader cannot help but be moved. Costello paints her character so vividly, so completely, that the reader can identify with Tess, her feelings (\&quot;…the mark of all anxiety: the acute awareness of the endless possibilities that can simultaneously imperil and enhance us, and all that might be lost or gained.\&quot;), her ideas (\&quot;It Ireland seemed to her now to be a place without dreams, or where dreaming was prohibited. Here, life could be lived at a higher, truer pitch. Though her own was a timid life, there was, since Theo's birth, a yearning towards motion and spirit and vitality.\&quot;), her reactions (\&quot;She thought of the water that had lain quietly calm, each tiny drop, each molecule, restful, suddenly wrenched, catapulted through a metal rotary, tossed back out into the turbulent current, reeling, confounded, changed.\&quot;). In both style and content, this novel is reminiscent of Sebastian Barry's work, in particular, \&quot;On Canaan's Side\&quot;. A remarkable debut novel.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The luxury suites all face the mountain and have balconies providing a panoramic view of the area.\nDouble, Single, and Family suites are available (see below).

The voices, noises, and music all tell stories that are unparalleled in the Jewish world – and perhaps in the world at large. One I find so compelling is that of my story and the story of the \&quot;other,\&quot; which I hear simultaneously.\nThere a variety of others in Jerusalem – Arabic, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish, and Hebrew – and over the course of a week, I can listen and hear these voices and countless more. It is one of the incredible characteristics of our city.\nJoin me on a brief tour of some of the other voices I am so fortunate to hear regularly in Jerusalem.\nSaruat shared her voice honestly and directly, telling us she came to Hebrew University intent on learning, but determined never to interact with Jewish Israelis. It was a harsh message. Hearing about the challenges she faces as a person without a country was painful, too. But, we were inspired by the story of the journey that led Saruat to seek out interactions with Jewish Israelis.\nAt URJ Heller High, we make sure students have ample opportunities to hear voices of others whom they may not otherwise encounter. When they learn about contemporary Jewry, they meet an ultra-Orthodox couple (and representatives of other streams of Judaism). The encounter may be the only time students have the chance to listen to Haredi Jews talk about what they believe and represent, and how they are different from other Jews we may know.\nIt's important for students – and all of us – to listen with an open mind to people who express theological, philosophical, and practical opinions that are completely foreign to them and often contradict their own deeply held beliefs. Almost every semester, our ultra-Orthodox guests stay well past the allotted time to answer students' many questions.\nErev Shabbat, Friday night, at the Western Wall (the Kotel) is the time and place to hear your own voice and those of others at the same time. Two weeks ago, we were at the egalitarian Kotel for the first Kabbalat Shabbat service of the semester. Just as we started our service, the muezzin (Muslim prayer leader) started chanting the call to prayer over the loudspeakers of the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, and the Middle Eastern music echoed throughout the Kotel plaza. At the same time, a group of yeshiva students began their Kabbalat Shabbat prayers which rebounded off the Kotel and into the area where we were seated. From over the wall, we heard prayers of the multitude of minyanim (prayer groups) at the \&quot;classic\&quot; Kotel floating heavenward. Although there were no church bells ringing in the mix, you could easily imagine them joining in on the chorus of prayerful sounds. Sitting at the egalitarian Kotel, I asked the students to listen and take in the divine sounds of erev Shabbat at the Kotel. After listening, we added our own voices to the Friday night symphony that is the Kotel.\nThe Hebrew word \&quot;sh'ma\&quot; and its variants appear 303 times in the Torah. That one word appears so many times demands our attention. In a world in which truly listening to the other is quickly becoming a lost art, the Torah reminds us of the supreme importance of this act. Throughout the semester, our students have ample opportunities to cultivate this skill – in class with peers, in the dining hall with kibbutzniks, during mifgashim (get togethers) with Israeli high school peers, and during presentations by people who live extremely different lives than they do, including a former teacher who is now a settler and a Palestinian student who lives in East Jerusalem.\nHearing and listening to these varied sounds and voices of Jerusalem and Israel – and finding value in both those that are familiar and those that are \&quot;other\&quot; – give students their own incredible stories to tell when they return home at the end of the semester.\nRabbi Loren Sykes lives in Jerusalem, Israel, where he is the principal of URJ Heller High.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;When you have an event, and you are expecting a lot of people example for a wedding then you will need a corporate catering company that will help you by ensuring that your guests leave the place when they have enjoyed the food. The food and drinks that are always in ceremonies are of importance because the people attending the party will not have to leave early as they will be sorted out in the right manner. The corporate catering company will be able to attain that if they are experienced, and they can know the amount to be serving in case they notice the amount of food and the number of people are not adding up.\nIf you have no idea of where to find corporate catering company then you can ask around from people or companies where they get their caterers from. You will have saved yourself some time and energy. When you search online, you will get a lot of information about different corporate catering companies. The following are some of the things that you should be added when searching for a corporate catering company.\nIt should be one made of a team that is experienced. The right one to choose is the one that is well experienced as you will be at peace with them.\nThe corporate catering company should be one that takes hygiene seriously because if they mess, then they will have messed up a big congregation. It should be an independent corporate catering company that has their things. That will make them seem focused on what they are doing. They should also have excellent communication skills so that they can relate well with the people in the event.\nIt should be a caring catering team that provides that everyone has been served. That is the best way to go about it because that is how people will end up like their services.\nThe corporate catering company should have an idea of how surprises go about. They can come up with their way of surprising the guests. It difficult to get such a company but they are there.\nIt should be known by a lot of people around the city. You will be able to know that once you interview a few people around the area. You can as well ask the people who have worked with them as they will tell you according to their view.\nIt will be better when you go to the one that a friend has advised you because they might have had an experience with it. That is because of the excellent job they do once they have been asked to make a meal and serve the guests. The corporate catering company must be providing quality services.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Karen Napier, Director\nWhile studying dance, Karen grew weary of seeing Christianity removed from the art, and vowed to provide a place where Christian dancers could study classical ballet and other dance arts in a God-glorifying manner.

The students are asked which employers they feel offer the best opportunities for graduates, with the feedback used to compile the top 100 list. Santander is the highest newcomer to the awards, and the Bank of England is the biggest climber.\nIain Gallagher, Emerging Talent Senior Manager at Santander, said: \&quot;We're delighted to be included in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers and even more so because it's feedback directly from the graduates themselves. It's really important for us to appeal to young talent from all walks of life, so it's great that we've been rated so highly by UK graduates.\&quot;\nScott Reeves, Graduate Relationship Manager, joined Santander in Glasgow having graduated from University of Edinburgh this summer. He said: \&quot;I'm seeing first-hand the opportunities Santander offers graduates and these drew me to the bank in the first instance. There is a wide variety of career paths open to people joining the bank and Santander's commitment to ensuring you develop throughout your career means there are lots of opportunities as you progress.\&quot;\nThe Times Top 100 Graduate Employers has been compiled from research with 18,353 final year students who left university in the summer of 2016 and is published as a full-colour hard-backed book. 60,000 copies are distributed free-of-charge to undergraduates through local careers services at fifty leading universities.\nSarah Webster at Santander Tel: 020 7756 5533 Mob: 07568112529\nThe press office operates from 8.00am to 6.00pm.

Within minutes, deputies at a nearby sheriff's department substation entered the school and arrested the two suspects after a struggle.\n\&quot;As officers were arriving at the school, they could still hear gunshots,\&quot; Douglas County Undersheriff Holly Nicholson-Kluth said.\nAuthorities did not release the name of the student who died, but said it was an 18-year-old man.\n\&quot;I have to believe that the quick response of the officers that got inside that school helped save lives,\&quot; Spurlock said. He did not identify the suspects, but said they are an adult and a minor who were not previously known to authorities. Authorities planned to search their homes and a vehicle at the school, he said.\nThe shooting comes nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the grim 20th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre that killed 13 people. The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) in adjacent communities south of Denver. It also comes exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\nThe STEM School Highlands Ranch is a public charter school with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.\nWitness accounts\nStudent Christian Paulson told television station KMGH that he was in study hall when he saw kids running and shouting, \&quot;School shooter!\&quot;\n\&quot;And I'm like, what? Is this real or fake? And then I just went after them,\&quot; Christian Paulson said. \&quot;And apparently, this is all real. And I tried to run with my life, but I'm out of breath.\&quot;\nRocco DeChalk, who lives near the school, told television station KUSA that he saw so many students running past his house that at first he thought it was a gym class. He went outside and saw a teenage boy who had been shot in the back being helped by a teacher and another student.\nThey brought the boy into his kitchen and alerted a police officer, who sent for an ambulance.\n\&quot;He made a comment, 'Oh, I'm starting to feel it now,'\&quot; DeChalk said. \&quot;I told him that was probably the adrenaline kicking in and he was going into shock.\&quot;\nThree area hospitals reported treating eight people in connection with the attack. Two were listed in serious condition, two were listed as stable, one was in good condition and three were released.\nEvacuating students\nLines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school, and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.\nThe sheriff's office directed parents to a nearby recreational center to pick up their children. A fleet of school buses arrived and dropped off students, some of whom were crying and holding hands with their classmates as they were helped off. An ambulance also pulled up and let out a half-dozen children, none of whom appeared to be physically injured.\n\&quot;We know this is a very worrisome situation for parents,\&quot; Nicholson-Kluth said. \&quot;Relatives are worried, and we are trying to get them back together as soon as possible.\&quot;\nGov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was making state public-safety resources available to help secure the site and evacuate students.\n\&quot;The heart of all Colorado is with the victims and their families,\&quot; he said.\nDemocratic Rep. Jason Crow, a gun-control supporter whose congressional district includes STEM, said the gun violence cannot continue.\n\&quot;It is not enough to send thoughts and prayers. It is empty.

It's rare to pick up a newspaper without some reference to it. We have satirical programmes about it. But, I'm not sure there is any more of it today than when Bernard Ingham span for Margaret Thatcher, although it's probably more professionally done nowadays.\nWe shouldn't be surprised by 'spin', for it is simply 'putting the best gloss on your story'. Surely nobody expects that anyone, whose reputation is in the public arena, would deliberately go out to 'put the worst gloss' on what they want to say?\nBut there is a big difference between 'spin' and 'telling whoppers'. I only wish our media became more obsessed with the latter than the former. In that way, they would do a public service by properly holding public representatives to account.\nMy Barnsley colleague, Michael Dugher, has just published a long list of 'Whoppers' that David Cameron has told at Prime Ministers' Questions over the last 12 months. Of course, we all occasionally make mistakes. Last week, my friend David Blunkett got something wrong in an interview on Radio 4; but, discovering his mistake, he was back on the radio within 30 minutes to apologise and to correct his error. But, to the best of my knowledge, David Cameron hasn't once set about correcting one of his 'whoppers'. He does us all a dis-service.\nAnd these things are not unimportant, because our Prime Ministers's statements are publicised throughout the world and, if left uncorrected, give a clearly wrong impression of what is happening. Judge for yourself, with these examples of what Mr Cameron said at PMQs on January 25th and what the facts actually are:\nDavid Cameron: \&quot;Hospital waiting times are down\&quot;\nFact: The number of patients not being treated within 18 weeks has soared by 43% since Mr Cameron became PM\nDavid Cameron: \&quot;Disabled children will not have their benefits cut.\&quot;\nFact: Department for Work and Pensions' assessment on the new universal credit showing that the rate paid to disabled children will fall from £53.84 to £26.75 a week.\nDavid Cameron: \&quot;There are more people in work today than there were at the time of the last election\&quot;\nFact: The Office for National Statistics says there are now 26,000 fewer people in work than at the last election.\nI'd prefer more spin and fewer whoppers.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaCommonCrawl\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Inquest into Albanian seaman's death postponed as official investigation continues\nBethany Whymark\nPublished: 4:37 PM February 8, 2019\nAlfred Ismaili at home in Albania with his three young children.

These narrators — including phone manufacturers in China, copper miners in Zambia, garment workers in Bangladesh, and farmers around the world — reveal the secret history of the things we buy, including lives and communities devastated by low wages, environmental degradation, and political repression. Sweeping in scope and rich in detail, these stories capture the interconnectivity of all people struggling to support themselves and their families. Narrators include Kalpona, a leading Bangladeshi labor organizer who led her first strike at 15; Han, who, as a teenager, began assembling circuit boards for an international electronics company based in Seoul; Albert, a copper miner in Zambia who, during a wage protest, was shot by representatives of the Chinese-owned mining company that he worked for; and Sanjay, who grew up in the shadow of the Bhopal chemical disaster, one of the worst industrial accidents in history.\n\&quot;A compelling message about the plight of labor workers worldwide...Hope for change comes in various forms throughout Goria's collection, including the strides made by Bangladesh worker Kalpona Akter, who, after years working in a textile mill, became a staunch activist and labor rights advocate. Their common trait, aside from a laborious livelihood, is a marked desire to initiate a movement to bar unreasonable and perilous working conditions and unfair wages. Goria dramatically acknowledges the legion of overlooked workers who 'produce the things we use every day,'expressed through the carefully chosen words of crusaders who share each other's individual hopes and hardships. Powerful and revealing testimony to the injustices of manual labor, infused with inspiration for global change.\&quot; —Kirkus Reviews\n\&quot;Compiled and edited by lawyer Goria, these oral accounts of labor abuses and the struggles of the working poor cover most corners of the globalized economy. Stories from workers and labor activists in far-flung locations, including Mexico, Zambia, Bangladesh, China, and South Korea, convey a sobering uniformity of harsh working conditions, low wages, coerced labor, and ruthless retribution against unions and advocates for workers' rights. Readers hear from Bangladeshi garment workers who struggled to get monthly minimum wages raised from $15 in 1994 to $43 by 2010; Indian farmers trapped in a cycle of borrowing, debt, and bankruptcy; and the Chinese factory worker whose journey to the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen started with excitement and ended with an accident that cost him a hand. A more hopeful strain about the resilience of labor emerges in some narratives: 'Never think that you're less than the boss,' counsels Ana Juarez, a Mexican garment worker and activist. As Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor rights advocate, says: 'It was hard for me to tell my story for this book and to make my life so public' but . . . 'if it lets another woman who has faced exploitation and repression feel that she is not alone, and even encourages her to speak up, then it is worth it.'\&quot; —Publishers Weekly\n\&quot;This book, edited by attorney Goria, uses oral history to introduce readers to 16 disadvantaged employees working in agriculture, the garment industry, natural resources, and electronics manufacturing in countries including India, Zambia, and the United States. These workers discuss their experiences with unsafe workplace conditions, organized labor, poor wages, and immigration. The interviews serve to educate readers about the working conditions of low-wage workers around the world and draw their attention to the challenges faced by employees toiling in less than desirable—and often unsafe—conditions. The book includes a time line of modern industrialization, a glossary, historical capsules providing context for the oral histories in the book, and an overview of the global decline of garment-industry wages. Readers interested in the plight of disadvantaged workers worldwide as well as the undesirable effects of globalization will be likewise interested in this book.

I've been looking into some corner cases for loading python (2.7 on osx) files as configuration files. I wanted to see what the behavior was if I circularly ran execfile.

Why does it stop after executing execfile ~1000 times?\n\nA: From the Python source code, Objects/dictobject.c:\n\n/* Note that, for historical reasons, PyDict_GetItem() suppresses all errors\n * that may occur (originally dicts supported only string keys, and exceptions\n * weren't possible).  So, while the original intent was that a NULL return\n * meant the key wasn't present, in reality it can mean that, or that an error\n * (suppressed) occurred while computing the key's hash, or that some error\n * (suppressed) occurred when comparing keys in the dict's internal probe\n * sequence.  A nasty example of the latter is when a Python-coded comparison\n * function hits a stack-depth error, which can cause this to return NULL\n * even if the key is present.\n */\n\nSo, PyDict_GetItem() does not always report errors correctly.  Interesting... so in the following code in Python/symtable.c,\nv = PyDict_GetItem(st->st_blocks, k);\nif (v) {\n    assert(PySTEntry_Check(v));\n    Py_INCREF(v);\n}\nelse {\n    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_KeyError,\n                    \&quot;unknown symbol table entry\&quot;);\n}\n\nAny error that occurs when looking up a symbol (including out-of-memory errors) will be turned into a KeyError.  This is probably a bug.\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaStackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Bully-boy pro lifers stake out prime minister's home - shameful tactics do nothing but fuel anger in abortion debate\nDaniel O'Carroll\nEnda Kenny: Irish Taoiseach target of aggressive abuse over abortion legislation.\nPro life campaigners aggrieved at proposed legislation which would legalize abortion under limited circumstances have been mounting a vitriolic campaign of abuse against Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny in recent weeks.\nIn doing so they have seriously undermined the cause they profess to serve and sustained images of a vigilante mob attempting to suppress dissenting views through crude intimidation.\nThe latest in a series of disquieting incidents has seen masked men campaigning outside the Castlebar home of the Taoiseach while his wife and son were at home yesterday before being removed by police.\nEarlier that day, Kenny was repeatedly heckled as he tried to conduct an opening ceremony at a completely unrelated commemoration ceremony in County Longford where he faced charges that he was proposing to \&quot;kill the unborn\&quot; in supporting the Bill.\nLast week he disclosed to the Dáil how he had received letter written in blood, sarcastic medals, plastic fetuses, and medical scapulars as result of the legislation, now in draft stage, which would allow abortions to be performed where the mother's life was in imminent danger as a result of the pregnancy.\nDespite Kenny's fervent Catholicism, he has sustained his mantra that \&quot;my book is the Constitution\&quot; and has refused to back down in the face of the often unsavory methodologies being employed by those opposed to the passage of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.\nOther politicians have been similarly inundated with phone calls from both legitimate pro-life lobbyists and more dubious vigilante crooks.\nOne politician described the concerted effort as a programme of \&quot;widespread intimidation\&quot;, saying that politicians had been spat at and people had been turning up at their homes at unusual hours in desperate attempts to convince them to vote against the proposals.\nOne female TD, allegedly, received a threat that her throat would be cut. should she vote with the government.\nEach TD (member of parliament) is estimated to be receiving 50 telephone calls a week from those opposed to the idea -- a relatively vast volume in a country with a comparatively small tradition of organized political lobbying.\nLast December the communications regulator was forced to intervene after members of the public reported a spate of automated telephone calls beseeching them to lobby their TDs to oppose the Bill. The 'robo calls' were accompanied by graphic anti-abortion posters, some targeting individual TDs.\nThose opposing the legislation are usually referred to as the 'pro-life' movement and comprise a broad swathe of religious Catholic voters as well as those opposed to the idea of any kind of abortion on atheist moral grounds.\nThey either argue that any kind of abortion is tantamount to murder or that the legislation is the first step on a road towards abortion on demand.\n'Pro choice' activists, the legislation's proponents, support a woman's right to chose to have an abortion or not.\nThe legislation represents the government's decision to legislate on the X case after the untimely demise of Savita Halappanavar. The hospital patient died of complications following doctors' refusal to grant her an abortion.\nWhile pro life activists' views resonate with a significant proportion of the population, even many of their supporters would question the propriety of intimidating members of the Taoiseach's family at their private home.\nOn the rare occasions where protests do take place outside a politician's family dwelling -- such as a similar anti-abortion demonstration outside Justice Minister Alan Shatter's private residence -- they are usually roundly condemned; I believe rightly so.\nMaking a case against abortion is a perfectly legitimate activity and on such a divisive issue was guaranteed to happen.\nBut resorting to the kind of sustained intimidation leveled against public representatives in recent weeks generates endless negative PR for the pro-life campaign and casts them in the prototypical role of agents of the controlling Catholic church which dominated the Ireland of yesteryear.\nLeader of the opposition party Fianna Fáil's decision to remove his party's whip system for the vote (effectively, allowing TDs to vote with their conscience and contravene party policy without the prospect of consequences) was an inspired move which removes personal responsibility accruing to TDs and ensures that they won't be forced to compromise their religious beliefs on the issue.\nHopefully the party's representatives as well as those voting along party lines can cast their ballot without having suffered through such abuse.\n(Correction: Subsequent to this post being sent for publication, a fathers' rights group, not affiliated with the pro life movement, claimed responsibility for the protest.)&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaCommonCrawl\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Niels Jacobsen (14 September 1865 - 31 January 1935) was a Danish architect and politician who worked primarily in Odense. He was also the Chairman of The Lego Group until his death.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Aabenraa, Jacobsen was the son of shipbuilder Niels Jacobsen and Marie Kjaer. Jacobsen initially trained as a bricklayer. In September 1884, he began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where he studied under Hans Jørgen Holm. Graduating in 1890, he was subsequently employed by Johan Daniel Herholdt, Ferdinand Meldahl, and Martin Nyrop. He opened his own design studio in Odense in 1893. From 1894 to 1908, he taught at Odense Technical College, served on the Board of Directors 1909-25, and participated in architectural competitions as a judge.

They slaughter various animals corresponding to the different types of offerings, they splatter blood on the altar and fire consumes the corpses. Aaron and his sons then bless the people and the people fall on their faces.\nThe second half of the portion is an explication of the dietary laws. We are told specifically which animals are kosher and which are not: we learn that kosher land animals have cloven hooves and are ruminants, kosher birds are not birds of prey and kosher sea creatures have fins and scales. We also learn some other regulations as to what may or may not be eaten.\nThere are many questions raised by this short passage, but we can understand from the text that Nadav and Avihu did something wrong, and they were punished for their transgression.\nPut in context with the passage that came before, we can have an understanding of what perhaps their transgression was. The Torah says they offered \&quot;alien fire, which God had not enjoined upon them.\&quot; Earlier in the parasha, when describing the initial sacrifices, the Torah says, at various times, \&quot;this is what God has commanded,\&quot; and \&quot;according to regulation\&quot; and \&quot;as Moses had commanded.\&quot; What the Torah is telling us is that while the first set of sacrifices was what was commanded, what Nadav and Avihu offered was not. Essentially what they were doing was offering a sacrifice that was outside the norm of the ordained and organized system of sacrifices.\nIt seems very extreme, though. Did they really deserve death for a slight deviation from the norm? And besides, is what they did so wrong? It can be argued that what Nadav and Avihu did when they offered the additional sacrifice was to further glorify God—they were not offering something in contradistinction to, but rather in addition to, what was proscribed, due to their zeal, or desire to serve, or love of Torah.\nThis may be, but what perhaps the Torah is trying to teach us in this story is the perils of individualism. The extreme nature of the story aside—and this isn't the first time a story in the Torah is extreme it its details—the Torah is showing us that by branching off on their own Nadav and Avihu were violating their communal responsibility and trust to the detriment of the whole. They system of sacrifices for the entire Israelite community was set. In making their own offering outside these norms, Nadav and Avihu were placing their own desires above the norms of the community. They were acting in their own self-interest. But for Nadav and Avihu, who were leaders and priests, it can't just be about them. It has to be about the whole.\nThis mindset does not just fall upon our leaders, but upon all of us who live in community. When we fail to take into account our communal responsibility, and we privilege ourselves over others, we privilege individualism over communalism, we weaken our social bonds.\nIndividualism is different than individuality. We are of course all individuals, we have our own likes and dislikes, ideas and dreams, needs and desires. We make our own choices and set our own path. But we do not live in a vacuum, we are part of a communal whole. We pursue our own paths within the context of others, and we have a responsibility and obligation to keep the needs and desires of others in mind as we seek to fulfill our own needs and desires.\nIn our day this can take many forms. The recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland brought the issue of vaccinations—and those who opt-out—to the fore. Locally the issue led to the public revelation of vaccination rates, and Yohanna and I discovered that Erez's elementary school had one of the highest unvaccinated rates. This was startling and unnerving. I don't need to get into issues of \&quot;herd immunity\&quot; or scientific detail, but to simply say that vaccines work because we all agree to use them. They are part of a social contract—we agree to abide by certain guidelines when we live in community, and when we privilege the self over the other—individualism over communalism—then we violate that contract.\nYes, we need to honor the individuality of each person, and do what we can to support those individual journeys. But we need to be mindful so that individuality does not become individualism.\nNadav and Avihu broke the rules. There are times we go must outside the box, and we need to do things differently. There are times we must think creatively, and we need to challenge the existing norms. But we must ask, to what end? If it is to serve others and a greater good, then that is something we should pursue. But if it is to serve our own self interest at the expense of others, then, as in the case of Nadav and Avihu, it is a transgression and there will be consequences.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cookies are small files placed on your device or held in your browser memory, when you visit our website.

I will go to a trucking web site for instance and get half the advertisements for internet design. Domain identify is the web site URL, the link or handle that needs to be entered within the deal with bar of your browser to open an internet site.\nThe templates are prime quality, but nobody desires to have an internet site which appears to be like like another.

Customers can use it with any well-liked browser.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This beautiful DIY Citrus Mint hand soap is made with essential oils and makes a great gift!\nSo who says that soap needs to be purely utilitarian? I don't know about you, but when it comes to my hand soap, I am drawn to two key things; scent and packaging, hands down. I have always been a packaging junkie and just a sucker for beautiful design. I love to go to stores and just look at all of the different ways companies have branded their products. I pay special attention to the colors, patterns and textures of the paper used. I think it's the marketer in me or maybe I'm just a geek… there's that.\nOne other important area that we just can't avoid is the topic of chemicals. Yes, those nasty chemicals that have found their way into all of our health and beauty products. Do you remember the antibacterial craze? OMG! It was like the companies and the media were telling us to live in a sterile bubble. It was so bad that people were ready to go add a hazmat suit to their daily wardrobe. There were antibacterial soaps, wipes, you name it. We became this germophobe society where \&quot;pass the Purell\&quot; became a thing at every social event.\nSo why is all this so bad? Well you see, we need our immune systems to keep us healthy, and by over using all of these antibacterial products, we start to kill those natural fighters in our bodies. Last year the FDA finally announced that there was not enough scientific evidence to show that over-the-counter antibacterial soaps were better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. If you want to find out more about the nasty chemicals, just google Triclosan, but make sure you are sitting down when you read about what types of chemicals have been allowed in our products. It is not pretty!\nWell enough of being a Debbie downer. Let's get on with the good stuff. This hand soap could not be easier to make with just a hand full of ingredients, that won't compromise your immune system.\nWe will be scenting our soap with essential oils which not only smell amazing, but have some great health benefits. I spoke about essential oils in my Essential Oils 101 post. This is a awesome place to start, especially if you are new to essential oils.\nFor this blend, I chose peppermint, lemon, lemongrass and tea tree essential oils. I love the citrusy aroma of the lemon and the lemongrass, paired with the peppermint, and the tea tree acts as an antibacterial. I like the addition of a little almond or jojoba oil to the blend to make sure that the soap doesn't dry out our hands. I mean, I live in MN so we do not need any extra dryness to our hands, especially in the winter.\nSo let's talk about these labels. Aren't they lovely? I made them especially for you….awe. You can print them here Citrus Mint Hand Soap Label. I couldn't give you a recipe for this great soap and leave you with some boring labeless vessel to put it in. Remember, it's all about the packaging. If you go the label route, you're definitely going to want to make sure you waterproof them, so please see the instructions in the recipe card found at the bottom of this post. You don't want to spend time making this beautiful handmade loveliness and then one pump of the soap and your ink has runneth away.\nI always make a couple extra bottles when I make a batch, because you never know when you need a quick last minute hostess gift. Pair this soap with a couple of nice dish or hand towels in a pretty basket and you have a fabulous, stylish, handmade gift. Who doesn't love something handmade?\nThis luxurious, DIY hand soap is made with essential oils, is easy to make, and makes a great gift.\nPlace water and liquid soap in a glass container with a spout. Mix together until blended.\nAdd essential oils and almond/jojoba oil. Blend until combined. Pour into glass jar with pump.\nRemove label from backing and attach to your pump bottle.\nIf the ingredients become slightly separated, tilt the bottle a couple of times before pumping.\nCarla – will this work with a foam soap pump?\nI have not tried this in a foaming soap pump. The pump bottle will need to be glass since the essential oils can erode plastic over time. Let me know if you try it. I would love to hear how it turns out.\nWorks in a foam pump.\nWhat size glass pump bottle?\nThe bottle is an 8oz. size. Thanks for the question. I updated the blog post to reflect the size.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Note: Javascript is disabled or is not supported by your browser.

Office of the Director.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting today that a small amount of material from an Ebola virus experiment that was securely transported from a Select‐Agent‐approved BSL‐4 lab to a Select‐Agent‐ approved BSL‐2 lab may have contained live virus. The material was on a sealed plate but should not have been moved into the BSL‐2 laboratory. We cannot rule out possible exposure of the one laboratory technician who worked with the material in the BSL‐2 laboratory.\tThere was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public. The event was discovered by the laboratory scientists yesterday, December 23, and reported to leadership within an hour of the discovery.\tThe event is under internal investigation by CDC, was reported to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, and reporting to the internal and national Select Agent Programs has been initiated. CDC will provide a report on the event when the investigation concludes. The BSL‐2 laboratory area had already been decontaminated and the material destroyed as a routine procedure before the error was identified. The laboratory was decontaminated for a second time, and is now closed and transfers from the BSL‐4 lab have been stopped while the review is taking place.\t\&quot;I am troubled by this incident in our Ebola research laboratory in Atlanta,\&quot; said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \&quot;We are monitoring the health of one technician who could possibly have been exposed and I have directed that there be a full review of every aspect of the incident and that CDC take all necessary measures. Thousands of laboratory scientists in more than 150 labs throughout CDC have taken extraordinary steps in recent months to improve safety. No risk to staff is acceptable, and our efforts to improve lab safety are essential ‐‐the safety of our employees is our highest priority.\&quot;\tCDC will continue to provide support during the Ebola epidemic through its research and diagnostic lab work. Skilled lab scientists in the Ebola response are valued contributors to ending this epidemic.\tBased on what was learned during the lab science and safety reviews earlier this year, CDC has taken several immediate actions in this incident including closure of the laboratory, notification of staff, initiation of a complete internal review, and notifications of regulatory oversight agencies. This review will give us a clear understanding of what happened in this case and what can be done to further improve laboratory safety.\tCDC has established a CDC‐wide single point of accountability for laboratory science and safety and this will aid in ensuring accountability in this situation.\tCDC will also report this event to its external advisory committee which provides ongoing advice and direction for laboratory science and safety.\nContainment Of Biohazards\nHemorrhagic Fever, Ebola\nLaboratory Infection/prevention &amp; Control\nStephen B.

Instead of turning this valve all the way open you can try opening it only ½ to ¾ of the way.\nIs the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system PT500 approved for use in California and other EPA regulated States?\nYes this system has been approved for sale in California and all EPA regulated states.\nCan the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system be used with Diesel?\nNo this system is designed to only work on gasoline applications.\nHow do I know if the PT500 Truck/Van Gas Transfer System will work with my vehicle?\nThe system was designed to work on any Fuel Injected Truck or Van that has factory installed quick disconnect Fuel Lines. Most trucks from the Late 1990's and newer have these connections. If you are not sure you can take a look at your vehicle Fuel Line to see if it is equipped with quick disconnects.\nWill the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system work on my motorcycle?\nThe system uses the factory quick disconnect fuel lines on 2001 and Newer Fuel-Injected Harley Davidson bikes; therefore it will only connect to those motorcycles. However you can still pump fuel into any brand motorcycle as long as the host bike is a Fuel Injected Harley.\nIs the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system a permanent installation?\nNo, the systems uses quick disconnects which allows it to be installed and removed in just seconds. After use just simply pack the system away in the provided storage pouch.\nWhat should I do if there is fuel leaking from where I connected the MC100 system to my motorcycle?\nFirst turn off the motorcycle and remove the MC100 system. Take a look up inside the motorcycles factory quick disconnect check valve and inspect the lower O-Ring. The majority of the time this O-Ring will be dried up or damaged from the Ethanol in fuels available today that eat away at the factory O-Rings. We sell replacement Viton O-Rings (MC200-5) or entire check valve rebuild kits (MC300) on our website which include everything you need to rebuild your factory check valve.\nI am using the MC400 Check Valve Repair Tools and keep bending the hooks, what am I doing wrong?\nIf you are bending the hooks it is mostly likely caused by applying too much pressure when inserting the tool up into the Check Valve. Try to apply only a slight amount of pressure while rotating the handle with the hook clockwise. You will feel the hook grab the O-Ring and then at this point you can pull straight down and the O-Ring should come right out. This may take a few tries to get the proper feel.

A slight 57-year-old from the nearby village of Colaba, Sawant is in his 30th year as a dabbawala (\&quot;one who carries the box\&quot;), part of an army of white-clad men who deliver about 200,000 homecooked lunches to Mumbai's workers each day.\nSince the 1890s, dabbawalas have navigated this city's crowded, chaotic streets, riding heavy bicycles with lunch tins—picked up from various workers' homes—dangling from the handlebars. Endurance is vital, as is an encyclopedic knowledge of the city: Mumbai's dabbawalas are said to make one error per 6 million deliveries, and any deviation from this rate is not taken lightly.\nThe traffic, as ever, is terrible, but the car eventually glides to a stop at the set of a Bollywood musical. Followed by a videographer, Sawant hands food to the young dancers, punctuating his delivery with the same courteous bow he always offers his customers. And that's that. The camera is switched off. The tins are handed back.

Would it put anyone in danger? What if there was a rumor the student was a gang member?\nThese are the questions the Ohio Supreme Court recently answered in the case of a Columbus high school student who was charged with possession of a deadly weapon after leaving his bag unattended on a bus.\nA little background: The U.S. Supreme Court had already found in the 1991 case of Florida v. Bostick that bag searches on buses are constitutionally doubtful in the best of circumstances. However, that differs somewhat from the one heard by the Ohio Supreme Court. Moreover, students have less privacy rights than adults.\nCouldn't any unattended bag contain a bomb?\nAccording to the Courthouse News Service, on one February morning in 2013, a student left his backpack on a bus. A school security guard found it and opened it only enough to identify its probable owner. Based on a rumor that the student was a gang member, however, he brought the backpack to the school principal instead of returning it to the student.\nThe school principal felt free to empty the bag, and inside they found bullets. The pair then contacted a police officer.\nThe principal, the security guard and the police officer confronted the student in a hallway, where the police officer executed a take-down and incapacitated the student.\nThey then searched another bag the student had on his person. Inside there was a gun.\nThe student was charged with possession of a deadly weapon, and argued that these searches were unreasonable — and therefore illegal under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He asked for the evidence to be suppressed, and both the trial court and the Franklin County Appeals Court agreed.\nThe Ohio Supreme Court disagreed and sent his case back to trial. First, the court reaffirmed that schools are \&quot;special needs\&quot; settings that allow more warrantless searches than would be allowed for adults.\nNext, they reasoned that at each step, the child's right to privacy was outweighed by the \&quot;In compelling governmental interest in protecting public-school students from physical harm.\&quot;\nAfter all, they reasoned, any unattended bag could contain a tiny explosive device fashioned out of carbon dioxide cartridges called a 'cricket bomb' like those attempted by the Columbine High School shooters. Such a bomb might not be noticed in a cursory search meant merely to identify the owner of the bag.\nUnder circumstances like those — however unlikely they might seem — surely the search was reasonable?\nLiquor Laws (3)\nOVI (77)\nOVI Defense (8)\nTraffic Law (4)\nWhy new parents need an estate plan\nEasing the financial stress of co-parenting after a divorce\nWhen should an estate plan be updated?\nCreating an estate plan amidst a major crisis in life\nOhio's Administrative License Suspension may sound unjust\nA Nationally Recognized Law Firm\nStart Fighting Today\n98 North Union Street\nMt.

Given the changes in the media landscape in the last decades, should the BBC move to another status?\nBBC, plc 2017\nIn a set of articles earlier in the year, I investigated the BBC as a public company, sometimes run by subscription and other times by adverts and by subscription.\nBritish Broadcasting Charity\nOne option that must be on the table is the change in the BBC from having a Royal Charter to being a charity.\nThe claims for the BBC's Royal Charter seem to be rather bust these days. Aside from the democratic implications in the 21st century of the head of state being able to make law by proclamation, the claimed benefits are long since gone.\nThe last three Prime Ministers have done away with once-treasured the BBC News independence.\nTony Blair used the strategy of a judge-lead whitewash (using the logic \&quot;the Prime Minister cannot lie because he is the Prime Minister\&quot;) to weaken the independent broadcaster.\nGordon Brown, by providing \&quot;free\&quot; TV Licences to pensioners allowed the state to co-opt a sizable part of the funds supposedly hypothecated from the TV Fee. He could have provided pensioners with a £150 uplift in their pensions.\nThis pensioner allocation was used by Prime Minister David Cameron to strong arm DG Thompson into cutting back the BBC in an egregious funding settlement.\nIt is clear that the BBC is no longer independent of government, the Royal Charter special guarantee no longer respected by Ministers \&quot;of the Crown\&quot;.\nSo, perhaps it would be sensible to do away with the 10-year cycle of renegotiation and move the Broadcaster to the status of the British Broadcasting Charity, and hope that the Charity Commission can provide a better protection for our national broadcaster than elderly monarch does.\nBBC salami-slicing returns to overnight services? 1\n#GreatBBC campaign launched 2\nGoodbye BBC Red Button! 3\nWant to know how much the BBC spend in England, Scotland, Wales and NI per home? 4\nS4C and Welsh Exceptionalism? 5\nBBC future: make sure you make the deadline 6\nSandra Blickem\nI am constantly disappointed with the BBC\nThe news is sparse in content and appears very biased\nThe scheduling is terrible putting one programme type on two or three channels at the same time, ie sport\nInstead of putting sport specials on the \&quot;secondary\&quot; channels 3 or 4 they remove other popular regulars altogether, very annoying\nTheir presenters are becoming less and less able, amicable, too serious, biased and non-entertaining!\nThey ignore complaints and criticism and simply carry on as before\nTheir sound is often compromised ie Jamaica Inn and I've noticed several others that are too loud, too quiet, too mumbled!\nI seriously wonder what is going on with them as a previously non-biased, friendly, intelligent people's\&quot; channel!\nSandra Blickem's 1 post\nMartin Baines\nIt seems to me, no-one really wants to ask the hard question: what is the BBC for?\nIt seems to me that the only rational justification for a compulsory tax given to just one broadcaster is to do the things the market does not do but are somehow considered a universal good.\nIf we deconstruct this, it used to be argued the BBC was the only way quality drama got made, not nasty populist stuff. Yet today, while the BBC still makes good programmes, it cannot claim a monopoly of good output - in fact I think one could argue it has been left behind by US subscription and internet makers like HBO, Showtime, ANC and NETFLIX.\nSimilarly in sport - once the BBC was felt necessary to ensure \&quot;national\&quot; sporting events got coverage, yet again that is clearly no longer the case. Yes the BBC still does a good job but its fund are such that it often is behind its commercial rivals. Perhaps sport would actually be better served by not having the BBC do it at all and regulating for free to air access for those supposed \&quot;national\&quot; events?\nSimilar arguments can be made on things like the arts, yet again we now have whole channels devoted to them that do as good (if not better) jobs of covering niche material.\nSo that finally leave The News. It is often argued the BBC is the gold standard of unbiased coverage with unrivalled worldwide news gathering. Yet the \&quot;unbiased\&quot; is clearly not true: in the name of spurious \&quot;balance\&quot; it veers between bland no reporting and biased coverage to plate whoever last called foul against them. Just look at the current controversy around UKIP - the BBC went from treating them as fringe party worthy of little but a joke to now being accused of ever coverage by virtually all other parties. And can we really say the BBC on screen news does a better job than ITV News, Channel 4 News, Sky News or Al Jazeera?\nNow none of that says the BBC is bad. In fact I think it is (generally) very good at what it does, but I cannot honestly see how we can justify the compulsion element any longer. My own view is that it would have better future as some sort of independent organisation or even split up. I am pretty sure the Drama output would survive in its own right (just look at how well BBC Worldwide does). Similarly news gathering is first class, and may, if freed from its government shackles, do even better providing either its own channels globally or perhaps as a source provider like Reuters. Perhaps keep The World Service as a state global propaganda arm funded by the Foreign Office as it was until the last charter settlement.\nMartin Baines's 14 posts\nSandra Blickem: Do you have actual data to support any of those very vague accusations? Biased? To who?\nI hate sport, but at the weekend, there is a lot of sport, and they only have two channels to show it (BBC3 &amp; 4 share with CBBC &amp; Cbeebies) - in reality they dont show sport on all channels all day.\nAnd if someone is covering a terrible disaster or questioning a politician, why would I want them to be other than 'too serious'. And the sound not being perfect on Jamica Inn is no more than a storm in a teacup. Sound is generally worse on all TV's these day - try listening to the other channels - the BBC is no better or worse.\nMartin Baines: Think of what would happen if there was no BBC. No Proms, no real kids TV (trust me, Cbeebies and CBBC are fantastic), but lots of reality shows, soaps and 'dramas'. I dont always like the BBC either, but when I look at other countries output, I'm not always impressed either. I think Roy Greenslade made an excellent argument as to why the BBC should contine in its current form: Why the public must rally to support the BBC licence fee | Media | theguardian.com\nI'm sick of the 'American TV is best/we have Netflix's' arguement. Firstly, we get the cream of the crop of US shows. Much of its is dross. In fact most shows dont make it past the pilot, never mind the first series. And while there is a lot of fantastic drama from the US, its a media market at least five times larger than our own. I'd expect more great drama.\nHBO, Showtime, ANC, etc are all cable channels where you subscribe, and where the programme makers are often allowed to take risks without fear of advertisers, language, content, etc. Have a look at the main US broadcast channels. Do you really think Hawaii 50 is better than Line of Duty?\nNetflix's? Netflix is a distributor of content, although like most other distributors, from the time of the 2 reelers, its moved into production as well. Its first big production? An adapation of a set of books made famous on TV by an TV adaption from the BBC...\nNetflix is great if you have fast broadband, and you want to watch a lot of different stuff (although relative poor compared with what the US site has to offer). Yet the huge majority of TV watched in the UK is live - its not even recorded.\nSport? I hate sport generally, but if the alternative is paying money to Rupert Murdoch, then the BBC should be allowed to cover sports.\nDrama? There are fantastic drama's on the BBC. Its been a really good year. Yes, some want more risk-taking, but overall, its been great. There should be no need to say US is better than UK - both have great stuff, but do things in slightly different ways, as this article pointed out: American vs British drama: why do we have to pick a side? | Television &amp; radio | theguardian.com\nArts? The BBC produces a huge amounts of stuff on the arts - and although Sky has two channels devoted to it, you have to pay more than your licence fee to watch them, and I suspect that they (and Sky Atlantic) are loss leaders to encourage people people like me to make the leap to Sky. If there was no BBC, then I suspect they would go in an instant.\nNews? Not always great - and I complain when its isn't. But overall, its has a huge range and can be brilliant. I have no desire to get my news in the same way as the US - which is perhaps why NPR uses the World Service so much. Are there really shackles on its news gathering? The joy of the World Serive is that it is seen as not just government propaganda. It might be the cheapest 'soft power' weapon the UK has, and its would better if the Foriegn Office coughed up for its upkeep, but thats not the BBC's fault.\nYou yourself admit that the BBC is very good at what it does, and I'm in total agreement. But you then say it should be broken up because the market can do it better, and that its a compulsory tax. I'm not sure the market can do it better, and if doesn't, then it will impossible to put the BBC back together again.\nThe tax thing is a bit like the whinging you get from libertarian types - 'its because of 'fredum' and 'rights'. Its rational, but only within a very particular worldview, and totally misses the point. Your 'made' to pay for lots of stuff you might never use via taxation, but why pick on something that you do use?\nSince 99.9% of people in the UK use the BBC on a weekly basis, and 98% use BBC1, we have made our choice, and its seems to work. We get relatively high quality stuff to watch and to listen to, with no adverts, on an 'all you can eat' basis. For 40p per household, per day. Can the market come up with a better offer - I doubt it. If we did slice and dice, for what are purely ideological reasons, I suspect, as the song says, we dont know what we've got til its gone.\nThe BBC gives us a mix of great TV, has a huge cultural reach, and keeps the rest honest.\nMikeB's 2,579 posts\nsentiment_satisfiedGold\nI think the best drama now comes from ITV\nIan's 497 posts\nPETER HUGHES\nThe licence fee equates to about 40 (forty) pence per day---less than a daily newspaper. For that we all receive ADVERT FREE Television AND Radio channels around the clock Listen to some of the programmes on BBC Radio 4----no commercial station would even consider covering this diverse range---why not? Because they have to keep THE ADVERTISERS HAPPY by delivering as a big an audience as possible.\nCurrently I am absolutely fed up with the Christmas adverts (Tesco one says \&quot;It's Christma)) but I thought Christmas was on 25th December !!\nA friend, who spent some time in USA, on his return said he missed the BBC's full output across tv and radio---so there you have it..\nPETER HUGHES's 13 posts\nLorna Smith\nWe only have Freeview and happily pay the 40p or so that allows us to watch the BBC and any other available channels. As pensioners, who still pay for our licence, we would not like to be forced to pay more ... and if the BBC lost the licence, we would certainly have to pay far more and probably be able to access fewer channels.\nPeople over the channel can pick up the BBC and watch in preference to the own stations ... Think that suggests familiarity breeds contempt. The BBC is really an asset we cannot afford to lose.\nLorna Smith's 11 posts\nFred Perkins\nI think most would agree that the BBC is good value for the licence fee.\nBut as Martin Baines has put very well, We (and even more, the BBC), has forgotten its purpose. It has become selectively very 'commercial', and being the recipient of a huge amount of what is in effect a 'tax', is going far beyond its original remit.\nThe BBC is now competing heavily with commercial broadcasters which can and do achieve much of what the BBC chooses to dip its toes into, and without the constraints or disciplines of a commercial company, but able to distort the commercial market in ways which don't necessarily benefit the viewer. Almost by definition, the BBC's success in achieving its remit should NOT result in a quest for audience ratings - but it does so, because it can afford to do so. It is also stifling innovation in the creative industries, by virtue of its scale. It benefits from legally-enforced additional licence 'fees', index linked, and further supported by it providing 'free' licences to pensioners - which government 'pays' for, even though it doesn't cost the BBC a penny to provide the service to them. Smoke and mirrors!!\nThe BBC has substantially abandoned the part of its remit that is about 'educating' the public. It appears to be leading the 'dumbing down' of TV, rather than focusing on higher ideals.\nMost countries have a 'state broadcaster' - and nowadays that is mainly about producing news, which is expensive to do properly, and difficult for commercial broadcasters anyway.\nIncredibly, Ofcom doesn't even regulate the BBC as to whether it's biased - the BBC is its own judge and jury. That too, surely needs to be changed - all other broadcasters who broadcast news have to abide by Ofcom rules.\nArguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus.\nLet's just accept that the BBC must be provided with state funding for its core remit, but must be prevented from interfering in areas beyond that, either by cross-subsidy or excessive cash in its coffers to 'play' in other areas.\nFred Perkins's 13 posts\nFred Perkins: You've allowed youself to be seduced by an ideological viewpoint, rather than a practical one, even though you admit that the BBC is good value for money.\nIs the BBC actually 'crowding out' the commercial sector, and has it strayed from its original remit? If we take its original remit to be the Reithian \&quot;inform, educate and entertain\&quot;, then the answer is no. Entertain means just that, and there is nothing wrong with the BBC producing programmes that we might actually want to watch and listen to. I'm sure there must have been people tutting that the BBC played light music and had comedy back in the 1930's, but we all seem to have survived. Think of all those classic BBC comedy programmes over the years - did that mean there were no decent comedies anywhere else on TV? Or drama?\nAs for crowding out, this is one of those free market bits of nonsense which pops up a lot, especially in the US. Thomas Frank basically has a whole chapter in 'The Wtecking Crew' devoted to shooting this meme down - pointing out that if you think 'guvment' is the problem, then anything it does well is bad, because government is bad. If the BBC is crowding out the private sector, then by that logic, so is the NHS, police, HM Revenue and the Army - all of which could be done by the private sector.\nIn reality, governemnt tends to help the private sector a great deal, as the book 'The Entreprenerial State' explains.\nThe BBC trains huge numbers of technicians, actors and directors. Think just how much drama the BBC makes each year - they are the single largest producer of drama on the planet - and then think what would happen if the BBC wasn't there. Brianist pointed out the results of such a report a while back - the conclusions were not good for the UK economy. And a huge amount of talent got their first break on the BBC. Anthony Mingella didn't start writing Oscar winners immediately - he started writing scripts for Grange Hill.\nIf the BBC was to produce only non commercial programmes, what would it look like?\nWe would perhaps have a 38 part series on the atonal composers from 1948-1982, documentaries on cheese making (just like National Lampoon's European Vacation), endless round table discussions on coastal erosion in Namibia and perhaps programmes on Mongolian throat singing. Possibly a film or two from the Swedish national film collection, showing the early works of a particularly gloomy director, obscure Scottish poets, and redubbed vintage Eastern Bloc animation (and a documentary on said animation). Cheap and very worthy children's prgrammes (here's bran, kids!), a series about the abandoned footwear found on Hadrian's Wall (actually, I would happily watch this), and an adaption of a famous 1923 Slovak play all about peasants, in the orginal Slovak. And dont forget the OU!\nOf course as soon as you put on this deeply high-brow stuff, the free-marketeers would immediately say that nobody watches this, and if they do, they should pay for it. Head they win, tails you lose.\nIn fact Sky was cheeky enough to try this argument some years ago about Eastenders - its popular, therefore commecial. In which case, it should be on Sky, which, although commercial, has produced remarkably few popular programmes.\nThe BBC has to supply a mixture, so as to inform, educate and entertain. Thats fine. I dont always want serious stuff. But, for those who think the BBC is dumbing down, this is the serious stuff from Radio 4 today. Thinking Allowed, Tweet of the Day, Start the Week (really good today), A Book of the Week about living in different houses, a drama about Syria, a documentary about horses on a housing estate. A History of Ideas, a series about the history of Mossad, an afternoon drama, a music quiz (with a lot of classical music), The Food Programme, a series about Scottish poets, Beyond Belief, a programme about the word Mongol(!), Crossing Continents, Shared Planet (about mangroves), The Book at Bedtime, and a programme about 'The Queen of African Music'. And of course Today, The World at One, PM, The World Tonight, and all the hourly news.\nAs for TV - have you seen BBC4? And there are some really good stuff on BBC3 - their Afghan programme is incrediably powerful.\n'Arguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus. ' - Thats saloon bar handwaving. C5 has currently a £200m budget. Its makes bascially no content itself, buys its news in, and of course has no radio operation of any sort. And most of it is rubbish. You get what you pay for. BBC radio currently costs £650m - so almost double the £350m you suggest would cover everything. Your entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. Lets see the data behind your thinking.\nI think that the BBC makes a good case here - BBC - Blogs - About the BBC - Why the licence fee is the best way to fund the BBC\nWhat I find is that those who argue against the licence fee is that they have no workable alternative, and seem largely to have an ideological problem with it, rather than anything fundermentally practical.\n@MikeB: I don't want to get into a slanging match throwing insults at each other.\nI said that I respect the BBC. I'm a broadcaster myself, and have been for 11 years. I know what broadcasting costs, and haven't been 'seduced by an ideological viewpoint'.\nMy point is simply that much has changed since the Public Service Broadcasting remit of the BBC (and our other PSBs) was originally set up.\nAny single organisation handed close to £4 Billion a year by the state cannot fail to have an impact on its sector. We in the UK have one of the finest broadcasting regimes in the world, and the creative industries collectively contribute around 8% of our GDP.\nBriant Butterworth opened this thread with some valid reasoning for change. The last few years have seen immense disruption and change in 'television' in its many forms.\nThe BBC has no monopoly of truth nor of wisdom. Nor indeed do politicians. It must surely therefore be time for a re-examination of the BBC's role in what is a much wider canvas than could ever have been envisaged when it was set up. In most industries, the Competition Authorities worry about dominance of any single organisation over the sector.\nGeordie lad\nLorna Smith: Would that what you say about \&quot;Advert Free\&quot; was true; far from it! Program start and stop times are now disrupted by the Beeb's adverts for its own programs.

This is important as living and breathing in this city,\&quot; COB chair Ashlee Davis said Monday. \&quot;That's how important this is. That's not OK.\&quot;\nThe board plans to issue a formal policy recommendation soon explaining their focus on transparency, as well as urging other departments to research possibly less expensive ways to store data and effectively use labor in processing video.\nThe board's executive team met Monday afternoon to assess a draft version of the recommendation they plan to issue to other stakeholders.\nThe board, which was established via a 2018 referendum approved by Nashville voters, is tasked with investigating allegations of police misconduct. The board also can recommend policy changes for the department.\nBody, dash cameras on hold\nA day after the board meeting, Mayor John Cooper announced plans to roll out a limited number of body cameras in 2020 while policy and cost questions are answered.\nThe city pulled back from a department-wide roll out last month amid a budget crisis and concerns over a mounting price tag.\nCooper's policy director John Buntin said it could cost more than $40 million per year to operate the cameras and analyze their footage, which he said was \&quot;deeply concerning\&quot; in the midst of a budget shortfall.\nThe delay has been tied to the state comptroller's urgent report to city leaders in November that Nashville was running out of money to pay its bills. The comptroller said officials must close a $41 million budget gap, or the state would take over the city's coffers.\nThe police department has about $10 million set aside to buy cameras, which have been a city priority since 2016. But city leaders have not decided how to handle millions in additional funds that could be needed as the body camera footage makes its way through the rest of the criminal justice system.\nDownstream costs could come from outside the mayor's office and MNPD; prosecutors and public defenders said they'll need funding to review thousands of hours of footage that becomes relevant in criminal cases.\nMonday's board meeting also included an update on the progress of the so-called Negotiation Task Force set up to allow representatives from the COB, mayor's office and MNPD to meet and negotiate the draft Memorandum of Understanding between the COB and MNPD.\nAlthough the COB representative to the task force, Phyllis Hildreth, was not present at the meeting, due to being out of town, board member Matthew Sweeney confirmed the task force is making progress on discussing the articles of the MOU.\nAlso not present Monday was the board staff's newly-appointed Executive Director Jill Fitcheard, who was tied up at another meeting, the board was informed.\nFitcheard was named the new director last week after the unexpected resignation of William Weeden, announced Nov. 18.\nDavis confirmed Monday that Fitcheard's salary would be updated to reflect her new position, effective as of the day last week she was named to the role.\n\&quot;I have had a conversation with Director Fitcheard since our last meeting. I wanted to ensure she has all the support she needs,\&quot; Davis said.\n\&quot;Mrs. Fitcheard's commitment to the mission and purpose of the Community Oversight Board, and most importantly to the Nashville community, is unparalleled and her leadership has been instrumental to the success and continuity of the COB's efforts,\&quot; Davis said in a statement last week. \&quot;The COB congratulates her on this deserving appointment and looks forward to this continued work and progress with her as our Executive Director.\&quot;\nIncludes reporting by Adam Tamburin.\nReach reporter Mariah Timms at mtimms@tennessean.com or 615-259-8344 and on Twitter @MariahTimms.\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2019/12/10/nashville-community-oversight-board-police-body-cameras/2633823001/\nLawsuit: Sumner schools failed to protect child sexually assaulted by classmate\nSenate passes anti-LGBT adoption bill\nNashville-to-Atlanta train service?

I just started experiencing with the framework, and not everything is clear for me at the moment, so excuse me if my problem can be solved in some obvious way.\nIn my app I have login view controller with simple form contains two text fields (username and password) and a button. I would like the button to be disabled if any of two text fields is empty. So, I wrote this code:\nRAC(self.loginButton, enabled) = \n[RACSignal combineLatest:@[self.userTextField.rac_textSignal,\n                           self.passwordTextField.rac_textSignal]\n                  reduce:^(NSString *username,\n                           NSString *password) {\n                      BOOL valid = (username.length > 0 &amp;&amp; password.length > 0);\n                      return @(valid);\n                  }];\n\nIt's very simple and it's working. The problem is that one of my text fields (the password field) has secureTextEntry and clearsOnBeginEditing properties set to YES. I will try to explain unwanted behavior that I am experiencing with this configuration:\nLet's assume that both username and password fields are NOT empty. In this case the button is enabled. When user taps on password field, it becomes first responder (keyboard appears and user can enter his password), but because of clearsOnBeginEditing being set to YES for that field, the previously entered password is cleared from the text field. That's way password field is now empty. The problem is that signal is not being sent, so the button remains enabled, despite the password field is empty.\nMy first idea to solve this issue (well, more like workaround solution) was to observe isFirstResponder property on password field beside observing text changes. That's way the block that checks if button should be enabled would be called when password field becomes first responder. I don't know if this solution works, because I have no idea how to implement it using ReactiveCocoa. I have looking for creating a signal for isFirstResponder property changes, but without a luck. It might be not the best approach in order to solve this issue, but nothing comes to my mind at this point.\nThen, the question is: how to observe isFirstResponder property with ReactiveCocoa?\nAnd more general question: how to observe text field's text changes when clearsOnBeginEditing is set to YES?\nUPDATE:\nI found out that I can create signal for UIControlEventEditingDidBegin event that should give me substitution of observing isFirstResponder property changes:\n[self.passwordTextField rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingDidBegin]\n\nUnfortunately this does not solve the issue. Now I understand that field is cleared AFTER it becomes first responder, and clearing field automatically after it becomes first responder does not send signal for text changes. That's way when validation block is executed it still thinks that password field is not empty, and the button remains enabled despite password field was cleared and it's empty.\n\nA: Unfortunately the -rac_textSignal only listens for UIControlEventEditingChanged. If  UIControlEventEditingDidBegin were added, you'd be all set.\nI suppose you could patch this into it and submit a pull request?\n- (RACSignal *)rac_textSignal {\n    @weakify(self);\n    return [[[[[RACSignal\n        defer:^{\n            @strongify(self);\n            return [RACSignal return:self];\n        }]\n        concat:[self rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingChanged|UIControlEventEditingDidBegin]]\n        map:^(UITextField *x) {\n            return x.text;\n        }]\n        takeUntil:self.rac_willDeallocSignal]\n        setNameWithFormat:@\&quot;%@ -rac_textSignal\&quot;, [self rac_description]];\n}\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaStackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;package com.basho.riak.client.itest;\n\nimport static org.junit.Assert.*;\n\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.URIException;\n\nimport com.basho.riak.client.request.RequestMeta;\nimport com.basho.riak.client.response.HttpResponse;\n\npublic class Utils {\n\n    public static RequestMeta WRITE_3_REPLICAS() { return RequestMeta.writeParams(3, 3); }\n\n    public static void assertSuccess(HttpResponse response) {\n        if (!response.isSuccess()) {\n            StringBuilder msg = new StringBuilder(\&quot;Failed \&quot;);\n            msg.append(response.getHttpMethod().getName()).append(\&quot; \&quot;);\n            try {\n                msg.append(response.getHttpMethod().getURI().toString());\n            } catch (URIException e) {\n                msg.append(response.getHttpMethod().getPath());\n            }\n            msg.append(\&quot; -- \&quot;)\n                .append(response.getHttpMethod().getStatusLine()).append(\&quot;; \&quot;)\n                .append(\&quot;Response headers: \&quot;).append(response.getHttpHeaders().toString()).append(\&quot;; \&quot;)\n                .append(\&quot;Response body: \&quot;).append(response.getBody());\n            fail(msg.toString());\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaGithub\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:48,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Riverside Youth Theatre (RYT) was started in 1982 to provide opportunities for young people aged between 12 and 18 who have an interest in drama.\nMembers can join the acting team or the technical, and many members choose to experience both.\nProductions range from period costume drama to musicals and are always demanding.We aim to encourage an interest and develop skills and experience in all aspects of theatre.

Charlie Baker says he's satisfied with the rollout of the state's first recreational marijuana retail stores.\n\&quot;I think it's gone what I would describe, I guess, as mostly according to plan, which is a good thing,\&quot; Baker told MassLive.\nTwo stores, Cultivate in Leicester and New England Treatment Access (NETA) in Northampton, opened on Nov. 20, the first retail pot shops east of the Mississippi.\nThe Cannabis Control Commission released figures Tuesday showing consumers spent $2.2 million at the two shops over their first five days operation, as Leicester residents complained of traffic problems. The Worcester county town's police chief, James Hurley, told residents at a Monday night emergency meeting that novelty of the new pot shop will eventually fade away.\nThe five-member commission and the new agency's staffers are processing applications for additional retail shops across the state.\n\&quot;I think obviously for the commission this is the beginning and I'm anticipating that they'll learn as they go and if they need to make adjustments, they will,\&quot; Baker said after an unrelated holiday event at Faneuil Hall. \&quot;But as I've said before, I thought the fact that they were deliberate in their approach to the rollout was the right way to pursue it.\&quot;\nRecreational marijuana sales begin last week at two stores in Massachusetts, the first to open on the East Coast.\nBaker, who opposed marijuana legalization when the issue was on the 2016 ballot, said drugged driving remains his \&quot;biggest concern.\&quot;\n\&quot;It's very important that people recognize and appreciate the fact that this is not something they should be doing if they're planning to be driving,\&quot; Baker said, pointing to ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as public transportation.\n\&quot;I just hope people take that part seriously,\&quot; he said.\nIn a public awareness campaign on impaired driving, Massachusetts public safety officials sought to equate operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana with doing so under the influence of alcohol.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaC4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:50,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;home bar top ideas.

Even so, relationships between citizens and their representatives were precisely what those early patriots were helping to define, and the traditionally poor service the government has delivered in the two centuries since would have had many of them scratching their wigs.\nAccording to the latest scores from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), the federal government still lags behind the private sector when it comes to keeping people happy. This year, the feds scored a 68.9 out of a possible 100 points, while their commercial counterparts weighed in with a 75. The 68.9 score represented a 1.6 percent increase from last year, but the gap still remains. That turns out to be unsurprising, given rising consumer demands. \&quot;Look at most enterprises today and you can [almost always] get 24/7 service,\&quot; explains Ben Madgett, an analyst for New York–based research firm Datamonitor. \&quot;There's an expectation there now that you should get the same from government.\&quot;\nThe increasing expectations are also seen by Lisa Sherwin-Wulf, public-sector industry solutions manager for RightNow Technologies, a provider of on-demand customer experience solutions. Working with RightNow's 155 government-agency customers, there is growing pressure to increase operational efficiencies while at the same time ensuring that citizens can access any necessary information in their preferred channels. \&quot;People are expecting things like timely response by chat, interactive voice response, email, and Web forums…something in addition to just walking into an office or calling on the telephone,\&quot; she explains. \&quot;The bar has definitely been raised.\&quot;\nGovernment agencies on all levels, though, may have quite a bit of catching up to do. Ken Landoline, vice president of research for Reno, Nev.–based analyst firm Synergy Research Group, declares the public sector \&quot;15 to 20 years behind the customer care contact center world.\&quot; There is no doubt that many agencies are trying to improve their service offerings, but with a looming economic recession, less money to invest, and an ever-increasing population, will governments be able to catch up or just continue to run in place in the effort to provide citizen service? CRM takes a look at some agencies making the investment, amid others continuing to languish under the premise of \&quot;business as usual.\&quot;\nMadgett points to the e-government initiative that started approximately a decade ago as the moment when agencies determined they needed to bolster service to match what consumers were increasingly expecting from their retailers and other commercial engagements. \&quot;Certainly in the last five years there has been more of an uptake in this initiative,\&quot; he says. \&quot;Governments are starting to realize what's out there and take advantage of using the Internet at its most basic level to provide service.\&quot;\nThis can be seen as a win-win situation for many agencies, as technological innovations allow them to not only optimize their own processes but also cater to an increasingly Internet-fluent constituency. \&quot;Local government offices started to progress to online payments such as filing taxes,\&quot; Madgett says. \&quot;As that relationship has evolved, [agencies are] now looking for something to manage that process—hence CRM—and so it's about providing that level of service and then cracking it as well with analytics to find out how many people are paying online, the issues they're having, and how agencies can help [provide a resolution].\&quot;\nWhen it comes to CRM vendors able to hit the ground running with government outlets, Madgett points to typical big-name players including Oracle and SAP, but says others in the CRM world can cater to specific needs of different agencies on all levels. \&quot;You also have RightNow, Consona, and other smaller players who can hit more certain geographical markets, local government, and processes specific to them,\&quot; he says.\nSince government has been slower to adopt CRM, it has made many organizations loathe to stray from on-premises deployments to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Madgett's research finds there are more on-premises deployments in government than on-demand ones at this point—but that may start to change. \&quot;There are some [chief information officers] out there who have encouraged agencies to look more toward SaaS,\&quot; he says. \&quot;There's a lot of possibility there. We're not totally there yet, but there's certainly a movement [developing]…. We're cautiously optimistic.\&quot;\nRightNow's Sherwin-Wulf says the movement's already arrived, with most of the 150 government agencies on her company's client list having already gone with SaaS, thanks to its lower costs, speed of deployment, and scalability. She reports that many of her company's customers decide to focus on the channel which will have the most significant impact first—generally Web self-service. After that, the customer can scale up as usage grows—similar to how the private sector does it. \&quot;Government agencies need to deal with these rising challenges in a timely manner,\&quot; she says. \&quot;So they are becoming much more comfortable with that.\&quot;\nCRM ROADBLOCKS\nSo if government agencies are starting to grow more comfortable with deploying CRM to gain a more comprehensive view of the customer, then why haven't they all caught on? Madgett says there are several reasons: legal, operational, and cultural. It can start with terminology. \&quot;A lot of what we're talking about here is customer service, and the private sector–driven mentality to things,\&quot; he says. \&quot;In the government space, there is a [reluctance] to refer to the citizen as a customer, and that mindset has to go away. You have to be comfortable with thinking of your citizens as customers, even if you don't call them that.\&quot;\nMadgett also says it gets back to barriers traditionally set up in government agencies sensitive to data they've been charged to collect and maintain. He explains that sharing information across agencies—for example, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense—is not necessarily a given. This runs counter to the traditional argument that CRM provides a 360-degree view of the customer (or in government's case, the constituent). There are also some restrictions on sharing private, sensitive data among different funnels. Add that to the siloed nature of many offices, and even when it's legal to share information, many will not come together, regardless of whether they're local, state, or federal. \&quot;There's a challenge there because there is tension between creating a comprehensive view and avoiding 'Big Brother,' \&quot; Madgett says.\nMadgett says that, generally speaking, the government culture is already a slow adopter of technology. Implementing a CRM system at all can be an issue: At heart, CRM is a strategic solution before a technological one. To Madgett, it doesn't matter whether you're a government agency or a retail chain, recklessly adding new capabilities without first thinking about business benefits can lead to a doomed implementation. \&quot;You need someone who [understands] to champion this like [New York City Mayor Michael] Bloomberg with the 311 system,\&quot; he says, referring to the city's citizen-information call-in number. \&quot;You can't just implement a call center or throw in a CRM system. You have to know your end goal and take the proper steps to figure out how to best allocate resources based on that.\&quot; (See the NYC 311 chart, at right.)\nDIAL 311 FOR EVOLUTION\nFew cities have a larger constituency than New York City does. Boasting a population of more than 8 million people, the city decided back in 2002 to create a phone line for those living—and visiting—The Big Apple to be able to call for quick information. The service has never looked back since going live in 2003. \&quot;This is a great example of a concrete application of CRM,\&quot; Madgett proclaims. \&quot;At 3 a.m., you can still call up 311 if you have a noise complaint, if something is wrong, there's a leak in your apartment…you can find out instantaneously. This is the type of service we have come to expect.\&quot;\nWhile the system has been deemed a success so far, that doesn't mean it hasn't had to make some adjustments, according to Joe Morrisroe, the deputy commissioner and executive director of 311 and www.nyc.gov, the city's official Web site. There have been many lessons learned during the continual efforts at service improvement, Morrisroe says. One maxim was to prepare ahead of time depending on the particular season. In the winter months, he explains, 311 puts information at the beginning of the interactive voice response (IVR) recording about guidelines concerning heat and hot-water complaints. \&quot;It's a way of educating the populace,\&quot; he says.\nMorrisroe says that pushing information to the beginning of the IVR allows callers to either ignore the message if it doesn't apply to them, or avoid having to wait for a representative to take the call. He admits call spikes can put a strain on the 311 system, but insists the city doesn't blindly rely upon the IVR—there are other safeguards in place to avoid a backlog of calls, he says. \&quot;We're staffed very well to ensure calls are answered quickly,\&quot; he says. \&quot;We have organic growth in our call center; a lot of people in staff support—be it supervisors or team leaders—are former call-takers or have that skill set. We can mobilize people quickly and put them on the phones if necessary to help with the volume.\&quot;\nThis can come into play as the economic recession threatens to freeze or cut the budgets of many government agencies. While it is not yet clear if the 311 system will be affected, Morrisroe says he's already taking safeguards to maintain high service quality. \&quot;The goal we have is not a lower-cost channel, but more of a self-service channel that can yield lower cost results,\&quot; he says.\nHe explains that after being open for business the past five years, there is plenty of robust content that can be available to the populace via the IVR and Web in order to lessen the barrage of calls for live agents.\n\&quot;We have answers to virtually any question someone in New York may have, and it is vetted by our organization as well as the requisite city agencies,\&quot; Morrisroe says. \&quot;That's one of our main goals—and the economic pressure helps facilitate that a bit more: to push more information into the IVR and Web than we did in the past.\&quot;\nFor Morrisroe, this is all in pursuit of the organization's mission. \&quot;Customer service is public service in action,\&quot; he says. \&quot;That's a motto we carry with us.\&quot;\nROCKY MOUNTAIN SELF-SERVICE\nRo Silva, public information and education manager in the taxpayer service division of the Colorado Department of Revenue (CODR), could be deemed a visionary for her time. Back in 1995, her agency began accepting email from stressed-out individuals who needed to send questions about tax inquiries without clogging the phone lines. \&quot;We were answering these [using] Microsoft Outlook,\&quot; she recalls. \&quot;In 2000, we were getting and answering 14,000 emails a year, which was a lot for that time. I knew it was going to evolve into asking the same questions over and over again.\&quot;\nShe turned to RightNow Technologies to create a Web self-service channel. Now, Colorado residents with questions come tax season can go to the department's Web site and look for answers before trying to email or call. In fact, Silva says, the system is set up so that Web-site visitors have to check out the \&quot;frequently asked questions\&quot; before being able to access the CODR email interface. Of course, that doesn't prevent residents from calling immediately. \&quot;People can make a phone call because those numbers are listed on our homepage, telephone book,\&quot; she insists. \&quot;You can call us no matter what.\&quot;\nAs a result of utilizing SaaS for its Web self-service, Silva was able to boost CODR's productivity, satisfaction, and cost-efficiency. The department has realized a return on investment of 8,732 percent, email volume has dropped by 45 percent, and the unit saved $700,000 over an 18-month period. And that doesn't even account for the peace of mind many residents have now when they can either find an answer quickly online, or be able to get through quickly to an agent with a more-complex question. \&quot;Our wait times are pretty good for a government agency…. They are about four minutes,\&quot; she says. \&quot;Before RightNow, during peak season people waited for 20 minutes to speak with a tax representative.\&quot;\nWhile there are no plans to innovate further with RightNow at this time, Silva says that it lays the groundwork for what could be an extra-difficult season, with the recession hitting the state of Colorado particularly hard—a hiring freeze on all state employees started in October 2008. \&quot;We're not able to hire any new [employees], which works against us even though we have all these great services people can self-service through,\&quot; she says. \&quot;It's going to hurt because…you still have people who have specific issues that need to be addressed, and it might mean they may not be able to get through as quickly.\&quot;\nSilva remains thankful that she has RightNow's system in place. Otherwise, they would have to shut down the email channel just to alleviate the pressure placed on the agents. \&quot;We just wouldn't be able to get to it all,\&quot; she says.\nGOVERNMENT 2.0—NEXT ON THE AGENDA?\nThe 800-pound gorilla in the room comes in the form of Web 2.0 technologies, including blogs, chat, forums, social networking sites, Twitter, and wikis. Filtering into the CRM world via the private sector, this is the next opportunity for innovation, according to Madgett. But, just as with traditional CRM deployments, strategy must be in place first. \&quot;Governments are slow to adopt, and especially with something like Web 2.0—where you get into using utilities like Twitter—they are experimenting with it but haven't captured what they want to do with it yet,\&quot; he says. \&quot;It's good to adopt the technology but without a strategic framework the practical usage of it can be lost.\&quot; (See this month's \&quot;CRM on Twitter,\&quot; page 16, for a quick snapshot of some government twitterers.)\nKaren Trebon, a program analyst with the General Services Administration's Office of Citizen Services, cites a plethora of examples of agencies at all levels starting to adopt varying forms of Web 2.0 technology to help inform and interact with their respective constituents. The examples run all the way to the top: With President Barack Obama in the White House now, she expects government to delve even deeper. From the Obama campaign's Web site to the transition team's efforts with www.change.gov to its revitalized www.whitehouse.gov, community participation clearly ranks high on the national public-policy scene. \&quot;One of the things that is driving this and will continue to [do so] is Obama coming into office,\&quot; she says. \&quot;I think everybody can agree that he outclassed [Senator John] McCain in the use of the Web and technology. For the first time, I think we'll have a president…who is just as smart as all of us about technology.\&quot;\nBeyond Obama's potential, Trebon admits she also feels the heat from constituents demanding equality in the service they receive from both the public and private sectors. \&quot;People love Amazon.com and they expect to go on our Web site and love it just as much,\&quot; she says. \&quot;We don't get allowances for being the government, so we have to keep up with what people want on the Web.\&quot;\nBy Trebon's count, there are 37 active, public-facing, federal agency blogs right now, plus an untold number of efforts at the lower levels of government. \&quot;[Blogging] seems to be the most adopted form of Web 2.0 at this time,\&quot; she says. \&quot;But a lot of these technologies are free or low-cost, so there is no worry about ROI or going and asking anyone for money.\&quot;\nSo if that's the case, why aren't more agencies picking up on Web 2.0? She believes it has to do with bandwidth concerns, potential viruses, and actionable strategy. \&quot;I spoke with representatives from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and they deal with very serious information including the [number] of people who are incarcerated and on death row…and they're not sure how to take this information and use it on something like Facebook,\&quot; she says. \&quot;To them, [that context] seems very lighthearted.\&quot;\nWhile that may be an extreme case, Trebon points to several instances in which using Web 2.0 can serve the people well. The bloggers at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) determined through blog comments that passengers were experiencing different rules at different airports, making unclear what rules were optional and which were absolutely mandatory, such as removing shoes before going through security. \&quot;[The TSA] actually used that information to tighten up the mandate across the country,\&quot; she says. \&quot;That's an example of how Web 2.0 can actually achieve results. The TSA didn't just take comments from people on the Web, but actually made a process improvement.\&quot;\nLike blogs, Trebon says Twitter can also provide an opportunity to continue a dialogue with constituents, particularly during times of crisis. \&quot;We used it here in our office during the Mumbai incident,\&quot; she says, referring to the December 2008 terrorist attacks. \&quot;People can follow our tweets to keep up to date on what's going on, where and how to call if you have family or friends in an area that's being affected by some form of calamity.\&quot;\nWhile still in its nascent stages, Government 2.0 has the potential to not only increase citizen satisfaction, but to offer a sense of transparency and, as a consequence, trust—a trait that's sometimes lacking but always essential to the democratic process. \&quot;The Obama team has been talking to us a lot about transparency and just putting more information out there,\&quot; Trebon says. \&quot;The interactive nature of these technologies increases trust in government and makes people feel like they're being listened to because we're responding back to them.\&quot;\nSIDEBAR: 2 Tips to Contact Center Implementation Bliss\nGary Peckham, director of the contact center for the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Service, knows a thing or two about quickly revamping a contact center to adjust to a quick mandate. Back in 2000, his department was charged with providing landlord and tenant issues to an additional 800,000 Calgary citizens when the city decided to cease offering the services on its own. Peckham had four months to make it happen, and he says he turned to Avaya to \&quot;bring us into the new century.\&quot;\nLooking back at the pain of the initial implementation, he has a couple of tips for government agencies now looking to revamp their contact centers:\nMake sure you listen to your employees. \&quot;We spent a lot of time dealing with Avaya's staff and making sure that we were understanding of them,\&quot; he recalls. \&quot;However, we didn't spend enough time explaining to our workers why things had to happen in a certain sequence.\&quot;\nWeigh all the purchasing options, even if you don't want to \&quot;reinvent the wheel.\&quot; \&quot;Government's mindset isn't necessarily the same as private business where you're always upgrading on an ongoing basis,\&quot; he explains. \&quot;When we purchase a product we anticipate that it will last a certain period of time. Consistent upgrades are not built into the budget process. Had we leased the product, we could have had an easier time when we had to keep up with the changing times. We needed to look at other options and how that would have been beneficial to the taxpayer in the long haul.\&quot;\nSIDEBAR: NYC 311: Call Volumes, Performance Levels, and Resolutions\nAgency Transfer or Referral: Caller is transferred to the appropriate agency or is referred to and provided with the appropriate agency's telephone number.\nInformation Provided: Caller has been provided with all of the requested information for their specific inquiry and no further action is required.\nService Request: Caller's request is entered into the City's Citizen Service Center tracking system and the request is forwarded to the appropriate agency for completion.\nTransfer to 911: Call is deemed an emergency, a crime in progress, or a Police Department 911 matter and is immediately transferred to 911.\nOther: Calls to follow-up on an existing service request or those that are not completed prior to the caller disconnection are classified as other.\nSource: www.nyc.gov; Mayor's Office of Operations\nPerformance Measure Performance Goal Fiscal 2009 Year-to-Date November 2008\nTotal Incoming Calls * 6,837,442 1,465,016\nAverage Weekday Call Volume * 53,049 60,816\nAverage Wait Time 30 seconds 7 seconds 6 seconds\n% of Calls Answered within 30 seconds 90% 94% 95%\n% of Language-Assisted Calls * 2.1%\n* No performance goal available\nAssistant Editor Christopher Musico can be reached at cmusico@destinationCRM.com.\nEvery month, CRM magazine covers the customer relationship management industry and beyond.

USA came into the final defeating England 2-1 whereas Netherlands entered the final courtesy a 1-0 win over Sweden.\nPreview, prediction, schedule\nThe three-time world champions USA are coming into the final riding high on a hard fought win against England. They have been in magnificent form throughout the tournament and have not lost a single match. However, their star player and probably the player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe was out of the semi-final clash due to a hamstring injury. But the USA team management have announced that she will be fit for the final. The loss of such a big player would have been a major setback for the team. With her in the team, they will be looking forward to adding another trophy to their collection.\nOn the other hand, Netherlands who are now oozing with confidence after qualifying for the final, came into the cup decider by beating Sweden in a hard fought 1-0 win. The sole goal of the match came in the 99th minute. The 2017 European champions will be hoping that their star player Lieke Martens performs up to her usual high standard and gets fit for the final. She was one of the reasons behind the 2017 triumph so her presence will be very vital for the Orange Brigade.\nThe USA definitely have the upper hand over first time finalist Netherlands and are, definitely, the favourite to win. But Netherlands, who have been unbeaten for the last 12 matches, will not let them win easily. An exciting match is on the cards.\nThe USA-Netherlands match will start at 5 PM on July 7 according to local time and 11 pm, July 7 according to SGT.\nGlobal TV listings\nUSA: Fox, FS1 (English)\nUSA: Universo, Telemundo (Spanish)\nUK: BBC\nAustralia: Optus Sport\nCanada: CTV, RDS, TSN\nSub-Saharan Africa: DirecTV Sports\nCristiano Ronaldo visits Singapore before Juventus' arrival\nSweden defeats Germany 2-1 to enter Women's world cup semis\nWomen's World cup: Dutch women beat Italy to reach semis for 1st time\nCricket World Cup final: ICC brazenly refuses to comment on umpires' big mistake\nAfter staying silent for two days, cricket's chief governing body finally...\nWimbledon, British GP and Cricket World Cup all happened in one Sunday [PHOTOS]\nIt was one of the best as well as exciting Sundays as all these three...\nNovak Djokovic takes 5th Wimbledon trophy beating Roger Federer\nThe Wimbledon men's tennis final ended after more than four hours of a...\nDramatic British GP ends with Lewis Hamilton's victory [VIDEO]\nThe British GP was supposed to be the battle for the top place, but the...\nSimona Halep wins Wimbledon 2019 Women's singles title\nThe Romanian became the first singles champion at the oldest Grand Slam...\nSerena Williams vs Simona Halep match details: Watch Wimbledon women's final Live\nCheck here to know Serena Williams vs Simona Halep match details and how...\nSlow batting, a bad shot and two magical deliveries!

That \&quot;small event\&quot; launched the great war in Europe, said Michael S. Neiberg, chair of war studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College. And once war begins, \&quot;it can be virtually impossible to get out.\&quot;\nIt took several years for the U.S. to agree to join the war, with politics playing a major role in that hesitation, Neiberg said. Once Congress agreed to enter the war on April 6, 1917, the U.S. military was unable to deploy quickly and took a year to be effective in Europe, he said.\nAmong the myths of the war is that the U.S. Army resisted working under French and British command, said Edward Lengel, chief historian of the White House Historical Association. In fact, \&quot;amalgamation\&quot; was happening by November 1917, \&quot;but the collaboration was not an easy one,\&quot; he said.\nThe U.S. Army proved to be exceptionally adaptable as the war went on, he said.\nThe April 6 discussion was co-hosted by AUSA and the Center for Military Diplomatic History, which promotes the application of history to contemporary problems.\nAusa Twitter\nTweets by AUSAorg\nSoldier Tests Speed Fielding of New Equipment\nMcPherson: Army Will Make Recruiting Goal This Year\nThe George Washington Chapter AUSA 2020 Scholarship Program\nAUSA VP for Veteran Affairs Raises $$$$ for Fisher House Charleston\nFuture Army Contributions to Space Force Discussed\nMcCarthy Seeks to Delay Military Hospital Merger\nMcConville: Army Must Innovate to Succeed\nArmy Expands Presence, Partnerships in Indo-Pacific\nLeaders Committed to Housing Improvements\nLab Highlights Science, Tech Advances&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;redpajama_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;RedPajamaCommonCrawl\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:60,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Handmade Natural Australian Parti Sapphire Solitaire Ring.\nCentre stone is an approx 1.20ct - 6.30 Round Cut Australian Sapphire from Rubyvale QLD in a simple 6 claw setting.\nBand Thickness: 1.70mm softly half rounded.\nThis piece is handmade to order especially fo you.

The Force was with J.J. Abrams when he launched the new set of "Star Wars" films with "The Force Awakens," so now Disney is bringing him back.
As Deadline reported on Tuesday, and according to a press release on StarWars.com, Abrams will return to write and direct "Star Wars: Episode IX." The statement reads:
A post shared by Star Wars (@starwars) on Sep 12, 2017 at 7:28am PDT
After Disney unexpectedly parted ways with former "Episode IX" director Colin Trevorrow earlier this month, rumors that Rian Johnson, who is directing "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," would take over surfaced. But Deadline reports that Johnson decided not to take the offer to direct.
On Abrams' hiring, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said, "With 'The Force Awakens,' J.J. delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy."
After what we saw in "Force Awakens," we're pretty excited about it, too. We just hope they call it "The Return of the J.J."

Holders of a Bachelor's degree in computer science from a University of Applied Sciences (with, in principle, a grade average of at least 5.0 in their Bachelor studies), or holders of a different type of University degree (in particular holders of a bachelor degree with a minor in computer science) can also submit an application to the matriculation services for consideration for admission. In such cases, the applications are considered on a case by case basis and the branch committee may require the applicant to earn additional ECTS credits (a maximum of 60) from courses at the Bachelor's level in a so-called "complement to the master program".
The goal of the complement to the master program is to complete the knowledge and skills of the previous studies to be prepared to the master program. The complement to the master program is usually composed by courses at the Bachelor's level in computer science and/or mathematics. The total number of credits that have to be earned in the complement to the master program and the exact list of courses (individual study plan) are defined by the branch committee on a case by case basis at the moment of treating the request for admission of the candidate. These credits can be acquired in parallel to the master studies but before starting the master thesis.
Since courses are mainly taught in English, sometimes also in French or German, knowledge of English is required; knowledge of French or German is a plus.
Independent which home university a student chooses, an admission request (from an academic point of view) is only treated once by the same competent authority, the branch committee.
These deadlines do not apply for students who are already registered for a program at one of the BeNeFri universities.</span></div></div>

This edition of IJPP celebrates ten years of steady publication of Iranian Journal of Plant Physiology. The story of IJPP is that of a journey that started from a local forum where the researchers and scholars mainly from the Islamic Azad University could share findings of their studies, gradually developing into an international peer-reviewed journal indexed by Islamic World Science Citation Center (https://isc.gov.ir/en) and SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank (www.scimagojr.com). We heartily appreciate numerous authors, both local and international, whose contributions have led us reach this far and look forward to more original research reports to move even further.
This edition is dedicated to late Mahlagha Ghorbanli, the emerita full professor of plant physiology in Kharazmi University, the first institution for teacher education in Iran. With her broad range of expertise and comprehensive knowledge of various research avenues in the field of plant physiology combined with a warm, caring, and supportive personality, professor Ghorbanli was the first Editor-in-Chief of IJPP, a prominent figure who was able to lead the editorial board of IJPP through the challenges inherent in starting a scientific journal. We owe much of what we have achieved to her scholarship and visions. May her soul rest in peace!

Medical, Dental Societies call for professional judgment in pain control
Susan Spencer TELEGRAM &amp; GAZETTE STAFF
Massachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Dental Society representatives say they're concerned about the misuse of prescribed medications, but also call for regulatory balance that allows prescribers to use their professional judgment to provide care that's best for patients.
"One of the unintended consequences is where you're so regulated, you're afraid to prescribe and people won't get the pain medication they need," said Dr. Ronald W. Dunlap, a cardiologist and president of the Medical Society. "We all have different pain thresholds. Some people have terrible pain."
Dr. Dunlap said the Medical Society was working with regulators to make the state Department of Public Health's Prescription Monitoring Program, a database of controlled substance prescriptions, less burdensome to use.
He also said pharmacy chains have extensive databases that could be used with DPH's data to identify providers who prescribe a large number of opioids.
Dr. Thomas Trowbridge, an oral surgeon in Lowell and a trustee of the Dental Society, said, "It's in our interest to promote the patient's appropriate amount of pain control."
He said adequately controlling pain hastens the healing process and helps patients get back to work or school.
The amount of medication needed varies by the weight and age of the patient, the procedure performed and other factors.
Dr. Trowbridge said that anecdotes about young people receiving large Vicodin or Percocet prescriptions after having their wisdom teeth removed needed to be taken in context.
"Often times it will be the first time for surgery where they've had to have pain control," Dr. Trowbridge said. But also, many people who don't share their anecdotes have wisdom teeth removed without notable post-surgery prescriptions, large or small.
"If we give them too few, it's been harder to call in more prescriptions," Dr. Trowbridge said, particularly for Schedule II drugs including Percocet and OxyContin, which in Massachusetts cannot be phoned in to the pharmacy.
"It's always good to have enough medicine ahead of time and prepare them for recovery."</span></div></div>

Feb 9th, 2018 +
In this article:defense, Military Strategy, Politics, society, United States, War
On January 19, 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis presented in Washington the declassified version of the United States' National Defense Strategy. In his speech, he made clear the militaristic approach that will be maintained in coming years: "This strategy expands our competitive space, prioritizes preparedness for war."
According to Mattis, the fight against terrorism will continue, "but Great Power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of U.S. national security," which means a readjustment of the approach since the attacks of September 11, 2001. In line with the National Security Strategy of December 2017, Russia and China are identified as the main threats to the U.S. On a second level, are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iran, and the most dangerous non-state actor is identified as the Islamic State.
The document notes, "The 2018 National Defense Strategy underpins our planned fiscal year 2019-2023 budgets, accelerating our modernization programs and devoting additional resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive advantage." In this sense, the U.S. will prioritize nuclear modernization, and investments in cyber and missile defense.
This the first time, in more than 15 years, that the U.S. has explicitly stated its interest in increasing military spending to maintain superiority over Russia and China, and consolidate its global hegemony. During this period, international terrorism served as the pretext for the strengthening of U.S. military forces, since after the fall of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the supposed threat that led the United States to exponentially increase its military budget after WWII, to the benefit of influential corporations, disappeared.
The language used recalls the Cold War era East-West conflict. The greatest exponent of the arms race was President Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 publicly launched the Strategic Defense Initiative, in which the scientific community was asked to develop a missile defense system to guarantee the protection of U.S. territory against a nuclear attack. It was also known as "Star Wars," like the famous film of the time. As was shown that on that occasion, the only winner was "the Military-Industrial Complex."
The current Strategy also reaffirms that the use of force will be applied as a foreign policy principle: "Reinforcing America's traditional tools of diplomacy, the Department provides military options to ensure the President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength." In addition, it is noted that states are the main actors on the global scene, but that non-state actors, such as terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, and hackers, "also threaten the security environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities."
The document emphasizes that the new strategy "articulates our strategy to compete, deter, and win" in this increasingly complex environment, stressing, "The costs of not implementing this strategy are clear. Failure to meet our defense objectives will result in decreasing U.S. global influence, eroding cohesion among allies and partners, and reduced access to markets that will contribute to a decline in our prosperity and standard of living."
It is noted: "A long-term strategic competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of national power – diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military," continuing: "More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength." At the same time, it is claimed the U.S. "is open to opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based on our national interests."
Latin America and the Caribbean are mentioned only twice, referring to the Western Hemisphere, and unlike the Strategy of December 2017, no specific country of the region is mentioned. The objectives of the Strategy include "maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere."
As outlined, the U.S. will deepen its relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries that "contribute military capabilities to shared regional and global security challenges." The document also notes, "The U.S. derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland."
Although not recognized in the Strategy, it is worth mentioning that Latin America and the Caribbean is the most densely populated area in the world, and that more than half a century ago, it was declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone, through the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Last month marked four years since the 33 member countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), meeting at their Second Summit, in Havana January 28-29, 2014, declared "Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace."
This is the "civilized" world of the 21st century – some proclaim peace while others enact war. The Pentagon has revealed it is committed to building "a more lethal force," in clear defiance of international peace, and to justify its 700 billion dollar military budget for 2018.
The Strategy defends President Donald Trump's nationalist electoral platform of "America first," which combines diplomatic isolationism and economic protectionism, with military reinforcement and the denial of the threat of climate change. A "novel" formula to try to maintain global hegemony, and another "good deal" for the Military-Industrial Complex.

Academy Street is the first novel by Irish author, Mary Costello. It chronicles the life of Teresa Lohan, from her youth in rural Ireland in the 1940s through her time in New York and her return to Ireland in her sixties. Tess is seemingly unremarkable, both as a child and an adult: a shy, sensitive child; a woman with an essential loneliness ("It seemed at times that she was marooned on an island, a moat of water, wide and black, separating her from all human love."); a mother who feels she could have done better. Nonetheless, Costello's exquisite prose conveys this life with such emotion, such care, that the reader cannot help but be moved. Costello paints her character so vividly, so completely, that the reader can identify with Tess, her feelings ("…the mark of all anxiety: the acute awareness of the endless possibilities that can simultaneously imperil and enhance us, and all that might be lost or gained."), her ideas ("It Ireland seemed to her now to be a place without dreams, or where dreaming was prohibited. Here, life could be lived at a higher, truer pitch. Though her own was a timid life, there was, since Theo's birth, a yearning towards motion and spirit and vitality."), her reactions ("She thought of the water that had lain quietly calm, each tiny drop, each molecule, restful, suddenly wrenched, catapulted through a metal rotary, tossed back out into the turbulent current, reeling, confounded, changed."). In both style and content, this novel is reminiscent of Sebastian Barry's work, in particular, "On Canaan's Side". A remarkable debut novel.</span></div></div>

The voices, noises, and music all tell stories that are unparalleled in the Jewish world – and perhaps in the world at large. One I find so compelling is that of my story and the story of the "other," which I hear simultaneously.
There a variety of others in Jerusalem – Arabic, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish, and Hebrew – and over the course of a week, I can listen and hear these voices and countless more. It is one of the incredible characteristics of our city.
Join me on a brief tour of some of the other voices I am so fortunate to hear regularly in Jerusalem.
Saruat shared her voice honestly and directly, telling us she came to Hebrew University intent on learning, but determined never to interact with Jewish Israelis. It was a harsh message. Hearing about the challenges she faces as a person without a country was painful, too. But, we were inspired by the story of the journey that led Saruat to seek out interactions with Jewish Israelis.
At URJ Heller High, we make sure students have ample opportunities to hear voices of others whom they may not otherwise encounter. When they learn about contemporary Jewry, they meet an ultra-Orthodox couple (and representatives of other streams of Judaism). The encounter may be the only time students have the chance to listen to Haredi Jews talk about what they believe and represent, and how they are different from other Jews we may know.
It's important for students – and all of us – to listen with an open mind to people who express theological, philosophical, and practical opinions that are completely foreign to them and often contradict their own deeply held beliefs. Almost every semester, our ultra-Orthodox guests stay well past the allotted time to answer students' many questions.
Erev Shabbat, Friday night, at the Western Wall (the Kotel) is the time and place to hear your own voice and those of others at the same time. Two weeks ago, we were at the egalitarian Kotel for the first Kabbalat Shabbat service of the semester. Just as we started our service, the muezzin (Muslim prayer leader) started chanting the call to prayer over the loudspeakers of the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, and the Middle Eastern music echoed throughout the Kotel plaza. At the same time, a group of yeshiva students began their Kabbalat Shabbat prayers which rebounded off the Kotel and into the area where we were seated. From over the wall, we heard prayers of the multitude of minyanim (prayer groups) at the "classic" Kotel floating heavenward. Although there were no church bells ringing in the mix, you could easily imagine them joining in on the chorus of prayerful sounds. Sitting at the egalitarian Kotel, I asked the students to listen and take in the divine sounds of erev Shabbat at the Kotel. After listening, we added our own voices to the Friday night symphony that is the Kotel.
The Hebrew word "sh'ma" and its variants appear 303 times in the Torah. That one word appears so many times demands our attention. In a world in which truly listening to the other is quickly becoming a lost art, the Torah reminds us of the supreme importance of this act. Throughout the semester, our students have ample opportunities to cultivate this skill – in class with peers, in the dining hall with kibbutzniks, during mifgashim (get togethers) with Israeli high school peers, and during presentations by people who live extremely different lives than they do, including a former teacher who is now a settler and a Palestinian student who lives in East Jerusalem.
Hearing and listening to these varied sounds and voices of Jerusalem and Israel – and finding value in both those that are familiar and those that are "other" – give students their own incredible stories to tell when they return home at the end of the semester.

The food and drinks that are always in ceremonies are of importance because the people attending the party will not have to leave early as they will be sorted out in the right manner. The corporate catering company will be able to attain that if they are experienced, and they can know the amount to be serving in case they notice the amount of food and the number of people are not adding up.
If you have no idea of where to find corporate catering company then you can ask around from people or companies where they get their caterers from. You will have saved yourself some time and energy. When you search online, you will get a lot of information about different corporate catering companies. The following are some of the things that you should be added when searching for a corporate catering company.
It should be one made of a team that is experienced. The right one to choose is the one that is well experienced as you will be at peace with them.
The corporate catering company should be one that takes hygiene seriously because if they mess, then they will have messed up a big congregation. It should be an independent corporate catering company that has their things. That will make them seem focused on what they are doing. They should also have excellent communication skills so that they can relate well with the people in the event.
It should be a caring catering team that provides that everyone has been served. That is the best way to go about it because that is how people will end up like their services.
The corporate catering company should have an idea of how surprises go about. They can come up with their way of surprising the guests. It difficult to get such a company but they are there.
It should be known by a lot of people around the city. You will be able to know that once you interview a few people around the area. You can as well ask the people who have worked with them as they will tell you according to their view.
It will be better when you go to the one that a friend has advised you because they might have had an experience with it. That is because of the excellent job they do once they have been asked to make a meal and serve the guests. The corporate catering company must be providing quality services.</span></div></div>

1 Dead, 8 Hurt in Colorado School Shooting; 2 in Custody
Two students opened fire Tuesday inside a charter school in an affluent suburban Denver community not far from Columbine High School, killing a teenager, wounding eight and spreading terror before they were taken into custody with no injuries, authorities said.
Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said the pair walked into the STEM School Highlands Ranch and began shooting students in two classrooms. Within minutes, deputies at a nearby sheriff's department substation entered the school and arrested the two suspects after a struggle.
"As officers were arriving at the school, they could still hear gunshots," Douglas County Undersheriff Holly Nicholson-Kluth said.
Authorities did not release the name of the student who died, but said it was an 18-year-old man.
"I have to believe that the quick response of the officers that got inside that school helped save lives," Spurlock said. He did not identify the suspects, but said they are an adult and a minor who were not previously known to authorities. Authorities planned to search their homes and a vehicle at the school, he said.
The shooting comes nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the grim 20th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre that killed 13 people. The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) in adjacent communities south of Denver. It also comes exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
The STEM School Highlands Ranch is a public charter school with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.
Witness accounts
Student Christian Paulson told television station KMGH that he was in study hall when he saw kids running and shouting, "School shooter!"
"And I'm like, what? Is this real or fake? And then I just went after them," Christian Paulson said. "And apparently, this is all real. And I tried to run with my life, but I'm out of breath."
Rocco DeChalk, who lives near the school, told television station KUSA that he saw so many students running past his house that at first he thought it was a gym class. He went outside and saw a teenage boy who had been shot in the back being helped by a teacher and another student.
They brought the boy into his kitchen and alerted a police officer, who sent for an ambulance.
"He made a comment, 'Oh, I'm starting to feel it now,'" DeChalk said. "I told him that was probably the adrenaline kicking in and he was going into shock."
Three area hospitals reported treating eight people in connection with the attack. Two were listed in serious condition, two were listed as stable, one was in good condition and three were released.
Evacuating students
Lines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school, and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.
The sheriff's office directed parents to a nearby recreational center to pick up their children. A fleet of school buses arrived and dropped off students, some of whom were crying and holding hands with their classmates as they were helped off. An ambulance also pulled up and let out a half-dozen children, none of whom appeared to be physically injured.
"We know this is a very worrisome situation for parents," Nicholson-Kluth said. "Relatives are worried, and we are trying to get them back together as soon as possible."
Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was making state public-safety resources available to help secure the site and evacuate students.
"The heart of all Colorado is with the victims and their families," he said.
Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, a gun-control supporter whose congressional district includes STEM, said the gun violence cannot continue.
"It is not enough to send thoughts and prayers. It is empty. It is weak, and it does an injustice to our children who are on the front lines of this violence," he said.

Over the last decade, the media have become obsessed with 'spin'. It's rare to pick up a newspaper without some reference to it. We have satirical programmes about it. But, I'm not sure there is any more of it today than when Bernard Ingham span for Margaret Thatcher, although it's probably more professionally done nowadays.
We shouldn't be surprised by 'spin', for it is simply 'putting the best gloss on your story'. Surely nobody expects that anyone, whose reputation is in the public arena, would deliberately go out to 'put the worst gloss' on what they want to say?
But there is a big difference between 'spin' and 'telling whoppers'. I only wish our media became more obsessed with the latter than the former. In that way, they would do a public service by properly holding public representatives to account.
My Barnsley colleague, Michael Dugher, has just published a long list of 'Whoppers' that David Cameron has told at Prime Ministers' Questions over the last 12 months. Of course, we all occasionally make mistakes. Last week, my friend David Blunkett got something wrong in an interview on Radio 4; but, discovering his mistake, he was back on the radio within 30 minutes to apologise and to correct his error. But, to the best of my knowledge, David Cameron hasn't once set about correcting one of his 'whoppers'. He does us all a dis-service.
And these things are not unimportant, because our Prime Ministers's statements are publicised throughout the world and, if left uncorrected, give a clearly wrong impression of what is happening. Judge for yourself, with these examples of what Mr Cameron said at PMQs on January 25th and what the facts actually are:
David Cameron: "Hospital waiting times are down"
Fact: The number of patients not being treated within 18 weeks has soared by 43% since Mr Cameron became PM
David Cameron: "Disabled children will not have their benefits cut."
Fact: Department for Work and Pensions' assessment on the new universal credit showing that the rate paid to disabled children will fall from £53.84 to £26.75 a week.
David Cameron: "There are more people in work today than there were at the time of the last election"
Fact: The Office for National Statistics says there are now 26,000 fewer people in work than at the last election.
I'd prefer more spin and fewer whoppers.</span></div></div>

An inquest into the death of an Albanian seaman in west Norfolk has been postponed again while investigations continue into the accident which led to the death.
Alfred Ismaili, 36, died on February 1, 2018 while working on a cargo ship at Alexandra Dock in King's Lynn.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is undertaking an investigation into his death, in which suspected breaches of regulation have been uncovered.
Johanna Thompson, assistant coroner for Norfolk, said that additional evidence needed to be submitted in the on-going investigation including on safe hatch lifting practises.
Mr Ismaili's inquest opening heard he died from a blunt force trauma injury.
A previous inquest review heard that the investigation into his death could lead to a criminal prosecution.
A further pre-inquest review was scheduled for May 2, 2019.</span></div></div>

VOICES FROM THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
Edited by Corrine Goria Foreword by Kalpona Akter
The men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy.
The men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy. These narrators — including phone manufacturers in China, copper miners in Zambia, garment workers in Bangladesh, and farmers around the world — reveal the secret history of the things we buy, including lives and communities devastated by low wages, environmental degradation, and political repression. Sweeping in scope and rich in detail, these stories capture the interconnectivity of all people struggling to support themselves and their families. Narrators include Kalpona, a leading Bangladeshi labor organizer who led her first strike at 15; Han, who, as a teenager, began assembling circuit boards for an international electronics company based in Seoul; Albert, a copper miner in Zambia who, during a wage protest, was shot by representatives of the Chinese-owned mining company that he worked for; and Sanjay, who grew up in the shadow of the Bhopal chemical disaster, one of the worst industrial accidents in history.
"A compelling message about the plight of labor workers worldwide...Hope for change comes in various forms throughout Goria's collection, including the strides made by Bangladesh worker Kalpona Akter, who, after years working in a textile mill, became a staunch activist and labor rights advocate. Their common trait, aside from a laborious livelihood, is a marked desire to initiate a movement to bar unreasonable and perilous working conditions and unfair wages. Goria dramatically acknowledges the legion of overlooked workers who 'produce the things we use every day,'expressed through the carefully chosen words of crusaders who share each other's individual hopes and hardships. Powerful and revealing testimony to the injustices of manual labor, infused with inspiration for global change." —Kirkus Reviews
"Compiled and edited by lawyer Goria, these oral accounts of labor abuses and the struggles of the working poor cover most corners of the globalized economy. Stories from workers and labor activists in far-flung locations, including Mexico, Zambia, Bangladesh, China, and South Korea, convey a sobering uniformity of harsh working conditions, low wages, coerced labor, and ruthless retribution against unions and advocates for workers' rights. Readers hear from Bangladeshi garment workers who struggled to get monthly minimum wages raised from $15 in 1994 to $43 by 2010; Indian farmers trapped in a cycle of borrowing, debt, and bankruptcy; and the Chinese factory worker whose journey to the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen started with excitement and ended with an accident that cost him a hand. A more hopeful strain about the resilience of labor emerges in some narratives: 'Never think that you're less than the boss,' counsels Ana Juarez, a Mexican garment worker and activist. As Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor rights advocate, says: 'It was hard for me to tell my story for this book and to make my life so public' but . . . 'if it lets another woman who has faced exploitation and repression feel that she is not alone, and even encourages her to speak up, then it is worth it.'" —Publishers Weekly
"This book, edited by attorney Goria, uses oral history to introduce readers to 16 disadvantaged employees working in agriculture, the garment industry, natural resources, and electronics manufacturing in countries including India, Zambia, and the United States. These workers discuss their experiences with unsafe workplace conditions, organized labor, poor wages, and immigration. The interviews serve to educate readers about the working conditions of low-wage workers around the world and draw their attention to the challenges faced by employees toiling in less than desirable—and often unsafe—conditions. The book includes a time line of modern industrialization, a glossary, historical capsules providing context for the oral histories in the book, and an overview of the global decline of garment-industry wages. Readers interested in the plight of disadvantaged workers worldwide as well as the undesirable effects of globalization will be likewise interested in this book. VERDICT: Recommended for a wide range of readers, from those served by high school libraries and public and academic ones as well." —Nathan Rupp, Library Journal</span></div></div>

I've been looking into some corner cases for loading python (2.7 on osx) files as configuration files. I wanted to see what the behavior was if I circularly ran execfile. I expected a out of memory error or a lot of swapping to occur, but I was rather surprised when I got a different result.
I setup a test scenario as follows:
'd' python script with:
#!/usr/bin/python
x = 0
execfile("d1")

'd1' python script with:
#!/usr/bin/python
x += 1
print "x = %d" % x
execfile("d2")

'd2' python script with:
#!/usr/bin/python
x += 1
print "x = %d" % x
execfile("d1")

The result:
$ ./d
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
... removed for brevity ...
x = 997
x = 998
x = 999
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./d", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d1")
  File "d1", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d2")
  File "d2", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d1")
... removed for brevity ...
  File "d1", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d2")
  File "d2", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d1")
  File "d1", line 5, in &lt;module>
    execfile("d2")
KeyError: 'unknown symbol table entry'

I was just curious if there was someone who could explain what is happening here? Why does it stop after executing execfile ~1000 times?

A: From the Python source code, Objects/dictobject.c:

/* Note that, for historical reasons, PyDict_GetItem() suppresses all errors
 * that may occur (originally dicts supported only string keys, and exceptions
 * weren't possible).  So, while the original intent was that a NULL return
 * meant the key wasn't present, in reality it can mean that, or that an error
 * (suppressed) occurred while computing the key's hash, or that some error
 * (suppressed) occurred when comparing keys in the dict's internal probe
 * sequence.  A nasty example of the latter is when a Python-coded comparison
 * function hits a stack-depth error, which can cause this to return NULL
 * even if the key is present.
 */

So, PyDict_GetItem() does not always report errors correctly.  Interesting... so in the following code in Python/symtable.c,
v = PyDict_GetItem(st->st_blocks, k);
if (v) {
    assert(PySTEntry_Check(v));
    Py_INCREF(v);
}
else {
    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_KeyError,
                    "unknown symbol table entry");
}

Any error that occurs when looking up a symbol (including out-of-memory errors) will be turned into a KeyError.  This is probably a bug.

Daniel O'Carroll
Enda Kenny: Irish Taoiseach target of aggressive abuse over abortion legislation.
Pro life campaigners aggrieved at proposed legislation which would legalize abortion under limited circumstances have been mounting a vitriolic campaign of abuse against Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny in recent weeks.
In doing so they have seriously undermined the cause they profess to serve and sustained images of a vigilante mob attempting to suppress dissenting views through crude intimidation.
The latest in a series of disquieting incidents has seen masked men campaigning outside the Castlebar home of the Taoiseach while his wife and son were at home yesterday before being removed by police.
Earlier that day, Kenny was repeatedly heckled as he tried to conduct an opening ceremony at a completely unrelated commemoration ceremony in County Longford where he faced charges that he was proposing to "kill the unborn" in supporting the Bill.
Last week he disclosed to the Dáil how he had received letter written in blood, sarcastic medals, plastic fetuses, and medical scapulars as result of the legislation, now in draft stage, which would allow abortions to be performed where the mother's life was in imminent danger as a result of the pregnancy.
Despite Kenny's fervent Catholicism, he has sustained his mantra that "my book is the Constitution" and has refused to back down in the face of the often unsavory methodologies being employed by those opposed to the passage of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.
Other politicians have been similarly inundated with phone calls from both legitimate pro-life lobbyists and more dubious vigilante crooks.
One politician described the concerted effort as a programme of "widespread intimidation", saying that politicians had been spat at and people had been turning up at their homes at unusual hours in desperate attempts to convince them to vote against the proposals.
One female TD, allegedly, received a threat that her throat would be cut. should she vote with the government.
Each TD (member of parliament) is estimated to be receiving 50 telephone calls a week from those opposed to the idea -- a relatively vast volume in a country with a comparatively small tradition of organized political lobbying.
Last December the communications regulator was forced to intervene after members of the public reported a spate of automated telephone calls beseeching them to lobby their TDs to oppose the Bill. The 'robo calls' were accompanied by graphic anti-abortion posters, some targeting individual TDs.
Those opposing the legislation are usually referred to as the 'pro-life' movement and comprise a broad swathe of religious Catholic voters as well as those opposed to the idea of any kind of abortion on atheist moral grounds.
They either argue that any kind of abortion is tantamount to murder or that the legislation is the first step on a road towards abortion on demand.
'Pro choice' activists, the legislation's proponents, support a woman's right to chose to have an abortion or not.
The legislation represents the government's decision to legislate on the X case after the untimely demise of Savita Halappanavar. The hospital patient died of complications following doctors' refusal to grant her an abortion.
While pro life activists' views resonate with a significant proportion of the population, even many of their supporters would question the propriety of intimidating members of the Taoiseach's family at their private home.
On the rare occasions where protests do take place outside a politician's family dwelling -- such as a similar anti-abortion demonstration outside Justice Minister Alan Shatter's private residence -- they are usually roundly condemned; I believe rightly so.
Making a case against abortion is a perfectly legitimate activity and on such a divisive issue was guaranteed to happen.
But resorting to the kind of sustained intimidation leveled against public representatives in recent weeks generates endless negative PR for the pro-life campaign and casts them in the prototypical role of agents of the controlling Catholic church which dominated the Ireland of yesteryear.
Leader of the opposition party Fianna Fáil's decision to remove his party's whip system for the vote (effectively, allowing TDs to vote with their conscience and contravene party policy without the prospect of consequences) was an inspired move which removes personal responsibility accruing to TDs and ensures that they won't be forced to compromise their religious beliefs on the issue.
Hopefully the party's representatives as well as those voting along party lines can cast their ballot without having suffered through such abuse.
(Correction: Subsequent to this post being sent for publication, a fathers' rights group, not affiliated with the pro life movement, claimed responsibility for the protest.)</span></div></div>

He was also the Chairman of The Lego Group until his death.

Biography
Born in Aabenraa, Jacobsen was the son of shipbuilder Niels Jacobsen and Marie Kjaer. Jacobsen initially trained as a bricklayer. In September 1884, he began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where he studied under Hans Jørgen Holm. Graduating in 1890, he was subsequently employed by Johan Daniel Herholdt, Ferdinand Meldahl, and Martin Nyrop. He opened his own design studio in Odense in 1893. From 1894 to 1908, he taught at Odense Technical College, served on the Board of Directors 1909-25, and participated in architectural competitions as a judge. Jacobsen was a member of the Odense City Council 1909-25, and chairman from 1911. He was honored as a Knight of the Dannebrog. Jacobsen was in Italy in 1891. He exhibited at Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1898, the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900, the City Hall exhibition in Copenhagen in 1901, as well as the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin in 1910.

On August 11, 1893, he married Christiane Sophie Magdalene Bertram Petersen Møller (born 1872, Gråsten). He died in 1935 and is buried in Odense.

The first half of the portion is the initiation of the sacrificial cult: the Torah describes in dramatic fashion the first sacrifices Aaron and his sons carry out in their role as priests. They slaughter various animals corresponding to the different types of offerings, they splatter blood on the altar and fire consumes the corpses. Aaron and his sons then bless the people and the people fall on their faces.
The second half of the portion is an explication of the dietary laws. We are told specifically which animals are kosher and which are not: we learn that kosher land animals have cloven hooves and are ruminants, kosher birds are not birds of prey and kosher sea creatures have fins and scales. We also learn some other regulations as to what may or may not be eaten.
There are many questions raised by this short passage, but we can understand from the text that Nadav and Avihu did something wrong, and they were punished for their transgression.
Put in context with the passage that came before, we can have an understanding of what perhaps their transgression was. The Torah says they offered "alien fire, which God had not enjoined upon them." Earlier in the parasha, when describing the initial sacrifices, the Torah says, at various times, "this is what God has commanded," and "according to regulation" and "as Moses had commanded." What the Torah is telling us is that while the first set of sacrifices was what was commanded, what Nadav and Avihu offered was not. Essentially what they were doing was offering a sacrifice that was outside the norm of the ordained and organized system of sacrifices.
It seems very extreme, though. Did they really deserve death for a slight deviation from the norm? And besides, is what they did so wrong? It can be argued that what Nadav and Avihu did when they offered the additional sacrifice was to further glorify God—they were not offering something in contradistinction to, but rather in addition to, what was proscribed, due to their zeal, or desire to serve, or love of Torah.
This may be, but what perhaps the Torah is trying to teach us in this story is the perils of individualism. The extreme nature of the story aside—and this isn't the first time a story in the Torah is extreme it its details—the Torah is showing us that by branching off on their own Nadav and Avihu were violating their communal responsibility and trust to the detriment of the whole. They system of sacrifices for the entire Israelite community was set. In making their own offering outside these norms, Nadav and Avihu were placing their own desires above the norms of the community. They were acting in their own self-interest. But for Nadav and Avihu, who were leaders and priests, it can't just be about them. It has to be about the whole.
This mindset does not just fall upon our leaders, but upon all of us who live in community. When we fail to take into account our communal responsibility, and we privilege ourselves over others, we privilege individualism over communalism, we weaken our social bonds.
Individualism is different than individuality. We are of course all individuals, we have our own likes and dislikes, ideas and dreams, needs and desires. We make our own choices and set our own path. But we do not live in a vacuum, we are part of a communal whole. We pursue our own paths within the context of others, and we have a responsibility and obligation to keep the needs and desires of others in mind as we seek to fulfill our own needs and desires.
In our day this can take many forms. The recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland brought the issue of vaccinations—and those who opt-out—to the fore. Locally the issue led to the public revelation of vaccination rates, and Yohanna and I discovered that Erez's elementary school had one of the highest unvaccinated rates. This was startling and unnerving. I don't need to get into issues of "herd immunity" or scientific detail, but to simply say that vaccines work because we all agree to use them. They are part of a social contract—we agree to abide by certain guidelines when we live in community, and when we privilege the self over the other—individualism over communalism—then we violate that contract.
Yes, we need to honor the individuality of each person, and do what we can to support those individual journeys. But we need to be mindful so that individuality does not become individualism.
Nadav and Avihu broke the rules. There are times we go must outside the box, and we need to do things differently. There are times we must think creatively, and we need to challenge the existing norms. But we must ask, to what end? If it is to serve others and a greater good, then that is something we should pursue. But if it is to serve our own self interest at the expense of others, then, as in the case of Nadav and Avihu, it is a transgression and there will be consequences.</span></div></div>

So who says that soap needs to be purely utilitarian? I don't know about you, but when it comes to my hand soap, I am drawn to two key things; scent and packaging, hands down. I have always been a packaging junkie and just a sucker for beautiful design. I love to go to stores and just look at all of the different ways companies have branded their products. I pay special attention to the colors, patterns and textures of the paper used. I think it's the marketer in me or maybe I'm just a geek… there's that.
One other important area that we just can't avoid is the topic of chemicals. Yes, those nasty chemicals that have found their way into all of our health and beauty products. Do you remember the antibacterial craze? OMG! It was like the companies and the media were telling us to live in a sterile bubble. It was so bad that people were ready to go add a hazmat suit to their daily wardrobe. There were antibacterial soaps, wipes, you name it. We became this germophobe society where "pass the Purell" became a thing at every social event.
So why is all this so bad? Well you see, we need our immune systems to keep us healthy, and by over using all of these antibacterial products, we start to kill those natural fighters in our bodies. Last year the FDA finally announced that there was not enough scientific evidence to show that over-the-counter antibacterial soaps were better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. If you want to find out more about the nasty chemicals, just google Triclosan, but make sure you are sitting down when you read about what types of chemicals have been allowed in our products. It is not pretty!
Well enough of being a Debbie downer. Let's get on with the good stuff. This hand soap could not be easier to make with just a hand full of ingredients, that won't compromise your immune system.
We will be scenting our soap with essential oils which not only smell amazing, but have some great health benefits. I spoke about essential oils in my Essential Oils 101 post. This is a awesome place to start, especially if you are new to essential oils.
For this blend, I chose peppermint, lemon, lemongrass and tea tree essential oils. I love the citrusy aroma of the lemon and the lemongrass, paired with the peppermint, and the tea tree acts as an antibacterial. I like the addition of a little almond or jojoba oil to the blend to make sure that the soap doesn't dry out our hands. I mean, I live in MN so we do not need any extra dryness to our hands, especially in the winter.
So let's talk about these labels. Aren't they lovely? I made them especially for you….awe. You can print them here Citrus Mint Hand Soap Label. I couldn't give you a recipe for this great soap and leave you with some boring labeless vessel to put it in. Remember, it's all about the packaging. If you go the label route, you're definitely going to want to make sure you waterproof them, so please see the instructions in the recipe card found at the bottom of this post. You don't want to spend time making this beautiful handmade loveliness and then one pump of the soap and your ink has runneth away.
I always make a couple extra bottles when I make a batch, because you never know when you need a quick last minute hostess gift. Pair this soap with a couple of nice dish or hand towels in a pretty basket and you have a fabulous, stylish, handmade gift. Who doesn't love something handmade?
This luxurious, DIY hand soap is made with essential oils, is easy to make, and makes a great gift.
Place water and liquid soap in a glass container with a spout. Mix together until blended.
Add essential oils and almond/jojoba oil. Blend until combined. Pour into glass jar with pump.
Remove label from backing and attach to your pump bottle.
If the ingredients become slightly separated, tilt the bottle a couple of times before pumping.
Carla – will this work with a foam soap pump?
I have not tried this in a foaming soap pump. The pump bottle will need to be glass since the essential oils can erode plastic over time. Let me know if you try it. I would love to hear how it turns out.
Works in a foam pump.
What size glass pump bottle?
The bottle is an 8oz. size. Thanks for the question. I updated the blog post to reflect the size.</span></div></div>

Lab safety report on Ebola virus transfer
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.). Office of the Director.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting today that a small amount of material from an Ebola virus experiment that was securely transported from a Select‐Agent‐approved BSL‐4 lab to a Select‐Agent‐ approved BSL‐2 lab may have contained live virus. The material was on a sealed plate but should not have been moved into the BSL‐2 laboratory. We cannot rule out possible exposure of the one laboratory technician who worked with the material in the BSL‐2 laboratory.	There was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public. The event was discovered by the laboratory scientists yesterday, December 23, and reported to leadership within an hour of the discovery.	The event is under internal investigation by CDC, was reported to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, and reporting to the internal and national Select Agent Programs has been initiated. CDC will provide a report on the event when the investigation concludes. The BSL‐2 laboratory area had already been decontaminated and the material destroyed as a routine procedure before the error was identified. The laboratory was decontaminated for a second time, and is now closed and transfers from the BSL‐4 lab have been stopped while the review is taking place.	"I am troubled by this incident in our Ebola research laboratory in Atlanta," said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. "We are monitoring the health of one technician who could possibly have been exposed and I have directed that there be a full review of every aspect of the incident and that CDC take all necessary measures. Thousands of laboratory scientists in more than 150 labs throughout CDC have taken extraordinary steps in recent months to improve safety. No risk to staff is acceptable, and our efforts to improve lab safety are essential ‐‐the safety of our employees is our highest priority."	CDC will continue to provide support during the Ebola epidemic through its research and diagnostic lab work. Skilled lab scientists in the Ebola response are valued contributors to ending this epidemic.	Based on what was learned during the lab science and safety reviews earlier this year, CDC has taken several immediate actions in this incident including closure of the laboratory, notification of staff, initiation of a complete internal review, and notifications of regulatory oversight agencies. This review will give us a clear understanding of what happened in this case and what can be done to further improve laboratory safety.	CDC has established a CDC‐wide single point of accountability for laboratory science and safety and this will aid in ensuring accountability in this situation.	CDC will also report this event to its external advisory committee which provides ongoing advice and direction for laboratory science and safety.

The maintenance is usually organised by a third party, such as a landlord or a management company.
Usually an estimate as to the charge is given at the beginning of a pre-defined year and a payment on account made. At the end of the year, accounts are produced and balancing credits or additional payments made.
The service charge costs can be significant and you need to consider this when purchasing. You need to consider the history of payments and future payments. Buildings with flat roofs or lifts can produce particularly high service charges.

"Yeah man, Cee Lo owed me a favor from way back," Joe Budden joked and laughed.
Goodie Mob probably feels the same. Cee Lo, a permanent vocal coach on the NBC reality show, The Voice, reunited with Goodie Mob, his longtime crew, for a performance on the mainstream American show last month. That performance came months after he shared the worldwide Super Bowl XLVI halftime stage with Madonna in February.

No, it will not void your vehicle warranty.
Is the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system a permanent installation?
Yes the system is meant to be permanently installed, however it can easily be removed and installed onto another vehicle if needed.
What kind of flow can I expect from the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system?
Since the system relies on the vehicles fuel pump the flow will be directly determined by the factory fuel pump that is on your vehicle. The majority of vehicles we have tested will flow over 1 gallon per minute.
What should I do if the Truck/Van Gas Transfer System causes my vehicle to stall when I use it?
Although this situation is very rare, you can prevent your vehicle from stalling by adjusting the Flow Valve on the back of the unit. Instead of turning this valve all the way open you can try opening it only ½ to ¾ of the way.
Is the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system PT500 approved for use in California and other EPA regulated States?
Yes this system has been approved for sale in California and all EPA regulated states.
Can the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system be used with Diesel?
No this system is designed to only work on gasoline applications.
How do I know if the PT500 Truck/Van Gas Transfer System will work with my vehicle?
The system was designed to work on any Fuel Injected Truck or Van that has factory installed quick disconnect Fuel Lines. Most trucks from the Late 1990's and newer have these connections. If you are not sure you can take a look at your vehicle Fuel Line to see if it is equipped with quick disconnects.
Will the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system work on my motorcycle?
The system uses the factory quick disconnect fuel lines on 2001 and Newer Fuel-Injected Harley Davidson bikes; therefore it will only connect to those motorcycles. However you can still pump fuel into any brand motorcycle as long as the host bike is a Fuel Injected Harley.
Is the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system a permanent installation?
No, the systems uses quick disconnects which allows it to be installed and removed in just seconds. After use just simply pack the system away in the provided storage pouch.
What should I do if there is fuel leaking from where I connected the MC100 system to my motorcycle?
First turn off the motorcycle and remove the MC100 system. Take a look up inside the motorcycles factory quick disconnect check valve and inspect the lower O-Ring. The majority of the time this O-Ring will be dried up or damaged from the Ethanol in fuels available today that eat away at the factory O-Rings. We sell replacement Viton O-Rings (MC200-5) or entire check valve rebuild kits (MC300) on our website which include everything you need to rebuild your factory check valve.
I am using the MC400 Check Valve Repair Tools and keep bending the hooks, what am I doing wrong?
If you are bending the hooks it is mostly likely caused by applying too much pressure when inserting the tool up into the Check Valve. Try to apply only a slight amount of pressure while rotating the handle with the hook clockwise. You will feel the hook grab the O-Ring and then at this point you can pull straight down and the O-Ring should come right out. This may take a few tries to get the proper feel. If you need replacement Hooks please feel free to contact us.</span></div></div>

A slight 57-year-old from the nearby village of Colaba, Sawant is in his 30th year as a dabbawala ("one who carries the box"), part of an army of white-clad men who deliver about 200,000 homecooked lunches to Mumbai's workers each day.
Since the 1890s, dabbawalas have navigated this city's crowded, chaotic streets, riding heavy bicycles with lunch tins—picked up from various workers' homes—dangling from the handlebars. Endurance is vital, as is an encyclopedic knowledge of the city: Mumbai's dabbawalas are said to make one error per 6 million deliveries, and any deviation from this rate is not taken lightly.
The traffic, as ever, is terrible, but the car eventually glides to a stop at the set of a Bollywood musical. Followed by a videographer, Sawant hands food to the young dancers, punctuating his delivery with the same courteous bow he always offers his customers. And that's that. The camera is switched off. The tins are handed back. Sawant leaves the set quietly, on foot, heading off to catch the crowded train that will take him home.</span></div></div>

Ohio Supreme Court: Warrantless search of student backpack was OK
On behalf of The Law Offices of Saia &amp; Piatt, Inc. | May 18, 2017 | Criminal Defense
If a high school student leaves his backpack on the bus, would it be fair for him or her to expect it to be left unopened? Would it put anyone in danger? What if there was a rumor the student was a gang member?
These are the questions the Ohio Supreme Court recently answered in the case of a Columbus high school student who was charged with possession of a deadly weapon after leaving his bag unattended on a bus.
A little background: The U.S. Supreme Court had already found in the 1991 case of Florida v. Bostick that bag searches on buses are constitutionally doubtful in the best of circumstances. However, that differs somewhat from the one heard by the Ohio Supreme Court. Moreover, students have less privacy rights than adults.
Couldn't any unattended bag contain a bomb?
According to the Courthouse News Service, on one February morning in 2013, a student left his backpack on a bus. A school security guard found it and opened it only enough to identify its probable owner. Based on a rumor that the student was a gang member, however, he brought the backpack to the school principal instead of returning it to the student.
The school principal felt free to empty the bag, and inside they found bullets. The pair then contacted a police officer.
The principal, the security guard and the police officer confronted the student in a hallway, where the police officer executed a take-down and incapacitated the student.
They then searched another bag the student had on his person. Inside there was a gun.
The student was charged with possession of a deadly weapon, and argued that these searches were unreasonable — and therefore illegal under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He asked for the evidence to be suppressed, and both the trial court and the Franklin County Appeals Court agreed.
The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed and sent his case back to trial. First, the court reaffirmed that schools are "special needs" settings that allow more warrantless searches than would be allowed for adults.
Next, they reasoned that at each step, the child's right to privacy was outweighed by the "In compelling governmental interest in protecting public-school students from physical harm."
After all, they reasoned, any unattended bag could contain a tiny explosive device fashioned out of carbon dioxide cartridges called a 'cricket bomb' like those attempted by the Columbine High School shooters. Such a bomb might not be noticed in a cursory search meant merely to identify the owner of the bag.
Under circumstances like those — however unlikely they might seem — surely the search was reasonable?

The BBC exists because, every ten years, the monarch has granted another Charter. Given the changes in the media landscape in the last decades, should the BBC move to another status?
BBC, plc 2017
In a set of articles earlier in the year, I investigated the BBC as a public company, sometimes run by subscription and other times by adverts and by subscription.
British Broadcasting Charity
One option that must be on the table is the change in the BBC from having a Royal Charter to being a charity.
The claims for the BBC's Royal Charter seem to be rather bust these days. Aside from the democratic implications in the 21st century of the head of state being able to make law by proclamation, the claimed benefits are long since gone.
The last three Prime Ministers have done away with once-treasured the BBC News independence.
Tony Blair used the strategy of a judge-lead whitewash (using the logic "the Prime Minister cannot lie because he is the Prime Minister") to weaken the independent broadcaster.
Gordon Brown, by providing "free" TV Licences to pensioners allowed the state to co-opt a sizable part of the funds supposedly hypothecated from the TV Fee. He could have provided pensioners with a £150 uplift in their pensions.
This pensioner allocation was used by Prime Minister David Cameron to strong arm DG Thompson into cutting back the BBC in an egregious funding settlement.
It is clear that the BBC is no longer independent of government, the Royal Charter special guarantee no longer respected by Ministers "of the Crown".
So, perhaps it would be sensible to do away with the 10-year cycle of renegotiation and move the Broadcaster to the status of the British Broadcasting Charity, and hope that the Charity Commission can provide a better protection for our national broadcaster than elderly monarch does.

I am constantly disappointed with the BBC
The news is sparse in content and appears very biased
The scheduling is terrible putting one programme type on two or three channels at the same time, ie sport
Instead of putting sport specials on the "secondary" channels 3 or 4 they remove other popular regulars altogether, very annoying
Their presenters are becoming less and less able, amicable, too serious, biased and non-entertaining!
They ignore complaints and criticism and simply carry on as before
Their sound is often compromised ie Jamaica Inn and I've noticed several others that are too loud, too quiet, too mumbled!
I seriously wonder what is going on with them as a previously non-biased, friendly, intelligent people's" channel!

Martin Baines
It seems to me, no-one really wants to ask the hard question: what is the BBC for?
It seems to me that the only rational justification for a compulsory tax given to just one broadcaster is to do the things the market does not do but are somehow considered a universal good.
If we deconstruct this, it used to be argued the BBC was the only way quality drama got made, not nasty populist stuff. Yet today, while the BBC still makes good programmes, it cannot claim a monopoly of good output - in fact I think one could argue it has been left behind by US subscription and internet makers like HBO, Showtime, ANC and NETFLIX.
Similarly in sport - once the BBC was felt necessary to ensure "national" sporting events got coverage, yet again that is clearly no longer the case. Yes the BBC still does a good job but its fund are such that it often is behind its commercial rivals. Perhaps sport would actually be better served by not having the BBC do it at all and regulating for free to air access for those supposed "national" events?
Similar arguments can be made on things like the arts, yet again we now have whole channels devoted to them that do as good (if not better) jobs of covering niche material.
So that finally leave The News. It is often argued the BBC is the gold standard of unbiased coverage with unrivalled worldwide news gathering. Yet the "unbiased" is clearly not true: in the name of spurious "balance" it veers between bland no reporting and biased coverage to plate whoever last called foul against them. Just look at the current controversy around UKIP - the BBC went from treating them as fringe party worthy of little but a joke to now being accused of ever coverage by virtually all other parties. And can we really say the BBC on screen news does a better job than ITV News, Channel 4 News, Sky News or Al Jazeera?
Now none of that says the BBC is bad. In fact I think it is (generally) very good at what it does, but I cannot honestly see how we can justify the compulsion element any longer. My own view is that it would have better future as some sort of independent organisation or even split up. I am pretty sure the Drama output would survive in its own right (just look at how well BBC Worldwide does). Similarly news gathering is first class, and may, if freed from its government shackles, do even better providing either its own channels globally or perhaps as a source provider like Reuters. Perhaps keep The World Service as a state global propaganda arm funded by the Foreign Office as it was until the last charter settlement.

Sandra Blickem: Do you have actual data to support any of those very vague accusations? Biased? To who?
I hate sport, but at the weekend, there is a lot of sport, and they only have two channels to show it (BBC3 &amp; 4 share with CBBC &amp; Cbeebies) - in reality they dont show sport on all channels all day.
And if someone is covering a terrible disaster or questioning a politician, why would I want them to be other than 'too serious'. And the sound not being perfect on Jamica Inn is no more than a storm in a teacup. Sound is generally worse on all TV's these day - try listening to the other channels - the BBC is no better or worse.
Martin Baines: Think of what would happen if there was no BBC. No Proms, no real kids TV (trust me, Cbeebies and CBBC are fantastic), but lots of reality shows, soaps and 'dramas'. I dont always like the BBC either, but when I look at other countries output, I'm not always impressed either. I think Roy Greenslade made an excellent argument as to why the BBC should contine in its current form: Why the public must rally to support the BBC licence fee | Media | theguardian.com
I'm sick of the 'American TV is best/we have Netflix's' arguement. Firstly, we get the cream of the crop of US shows. Much of its is dross. In fact most shows dont make it past the pilot, never mind the first series. And while there is a lot of fantastic drama from the US, its a media market at least five times larger than our own. I'd expect more great drama.
HBO, Showtime, ANC, etc are all cable channels where you subscribe, and where the programme makers are often allowed to take risks without fear of advertisers, language, content, etc. Have a look at the main US broadcast channels. Do you really think Hawaii 50 is better than Line of Duty?
Netflix's? Netflix is a distributor of content, although like most other distributors, from the time of the 2 reelers, its moved into production as well. Its first big production? An adapation of a set of books made famous on TV by an TV adaption from the BBC...
Netflix is great if you have fast broadband, and you want to watch a lot of different stuff (although relative poor compared with what the US site has to offer). Yet the huge majority of TV watched in the UK is live - its not even recorded.
Sport? I hate sport generally, but if the alternative is paying money to Rupert Murdoch, then the BBC should be allowed to cover sports.
Drama? There are fantastic drama's on the BBC. Its been a really good year. Yes, some want more risk-taking, but overall, its been great. There should be no need to say US is better than UK - both have great stuff, but do things in slightly different ways, as this article pointed out: American vs British drama: why do we have to pick a side? | Television &amp; radio | theguardian.com
Arts? The BBC produces a huge amounts of stuff on the arts - and although Sky has two channels devoted to it, you have to pay more than your licence fee to watch them, and I suspect that they (and Sky Atlantic) are loss leaders to encourage people people like me to make the leap to Sky. If there was no BBC, then I suspect they would go in an instant.
News? Not always great - and I complain when its isn't. But overall, its has a huge range and can be brilliant. I have no desire to get my news in the same way as the US - which is perhaps why NPR uses the World Service so much. Are there really shackles on its news gathering? The joy of the World Serive is that it is seen as not just government propaganda. It might be the cheapest 'soft power' weapon the UK has, and its would better if the Foriegn Office coughed up for its upkeep, but thats not the BBC's fault.
You yourself admit that the BBC is very good at what it does, and I'm in total agreement. But you then say it should be broken up because the market can do it better, and that its a compulsory tax. I'm not sure the market can do it better, and if doesn't, then it will impossible to put the BBC back together again.
The tax thing is a bit like the whinging you get from libertarian types - 'its because of 'fredum' and 'rights'. Its rational, but only within a very particular worldview, and totally misses the point. Your 'made' to pay for lots of stuff you might never use via taxation, but why pick on something that you do use?
Since 99.9% of people in the UK use the BBC on a weekly basis, and 98% use BBC1, we have made our choice, and its seems to work. We get relatively high quality stuff to watch and to listen to, with no adverts, on an 'all you can eat' basis. For 40p per household, per day. Can the market come up with a better offer - I doubt it. If we did slice and dice, for what are purely ideological reasons, I suspect, as the song says, we dont know what we've got til its gone.
The BBC gives us a mix of great TV, has a huge cultural reach, and keeps the rest honest.

The licence fee equates to about 40 (forty) pence per day---less than a daily newspaper. For that we all receive ADVERT FREE Television AND Radio channels around the clock Listen to some of the programmes on BBC Radio 4----no commercial station would even consider covering this diverse range---why not? Because they have to keep THE ADVERTISERS HAPPY by delivering as a big an audience as possible.
Currently I am absolutely fed up with the Christmas adverts (Tesco one says "It's Christma)) but I thought Christmas was on 25th December !!
A friend, who spent some time in USA, on his return said he missed the BBC's full output across tv and radio---so there you have it..

We only have Freeview and happily pay the 40p or so that allows us to watch the BBC and any other available channels. As pensioners, who still pay for our licence, we would not like to be forced to pay more ... and if the BBC lost the licence, we would certainly have to pay far more and probably be able to access fewer channels.
People over the channel can pick up the BBC and watch in preference to the own stations ... Think that suggests familiarity breeds contempt. The BBC is really an asset we cannot afford to lose.

I think most would agree that the BBC is good value for the licence fee.
But as Martin Baines has put very well, We (and even more, the BBC), has forgotten its purpose. It has become selectively very 'commercial', and being the recipient of a huge amount of what is in effect a 'tax', is going far beyond its original remit.
The BBC is now competing heavily with commercial broadcasters which can and do achieve much of what the BBC chooses to dip its toes into, and without the constraints or disciplines of a commercial company, but able to distort the commercial market in ways which don't necessarily benefit the viewer. Almost by definition, the BBC's success in achieving its remit should NOT result in a quest for audience ratings - but it does so, because it can afford to do so. It is also stifling innovation in the creative industries, by virtue of its scale. It benefits from legally-enforced additional licence 'fees', index linked, and further supported by it providing 'free' licences to pensioners - which government 'pays' for, even though it doesn't cost the BBC a penny to provide the service to them. Smoke and mirrors!!
The BBC has substantially abandoned the part of its remit that is about 'educating' the public. It appears to be leading the 'dumbing down' of TV, rather than focusing on higher ideals.
Most countries have a 'state broadcaster' - and nowadays that is mainly about producing news, which is expensive to do properly, and difficult for commercial broadcasters anyway.
Incredibly, Ofcom doesn't even regulate the BBC as to whether it's biased - the BBC is its own judge and jury. That too, surely needs to be changed - all other broadcasters who broadcast news have to abide by Ofcom rules.
Arguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus.
Let's just accept that the BBC must be provided with state funding for its core remit, but must be prevented from interfering in areas beyond that, either by cross-subsidy or excessive cash in its coffers to 'play' in other areas.

Fred Perkins: You've allowed youself to be seduced by an ideological viewpoint, rather than a practical one, even though you admit that the BBC is good value for money.
Is the BBC actually 'crowding out' the commercial sector, and has it strayed from its original remit? If we take its original remit to be the Reithian "inform, educate and entertain", then the answer is no. Entertain means just that, and there is nothing wrong with the BBC producing programmes that we might actually want to watch and listen to. I'm sure there must have been people tutting that the BBC played light music and had comedy back in the 1930's, but we all seem to have survived. Think of all those classic BBC comedy programmes over the years - did that mean there were no decent comedies anywhere else on TV? Or drama?
As for crowding out, this is one of those free market bits of nonsense which pops up a lot, especially in the US. Thomas Frank basically has a whole chapter in 'The Wtecking Crew' devoted to shooting this meme down - pointing out that if you think 'guvment' is the problem, then anything it does well is bad, because government is bad. If the BBC is crowding out the private sector, then by that logic, so is the NHS, police, HM Revenue and the Army - all of which could be done by the private sector.
In reality, governemnt tends to help the private sector a great deal, as the book 'The Entreprenerial State' explains.
The BBC trains huge numbers of technicians, actors and directors. Think just how much drama the BBC makes each year - they are the single largest producer of drama on the planet - and then think what would happen if the BBC wasn't there. Brianist pointed out the results of such a report a while back - the conclusions were not good for the UK economy. And a huge amount of talent got their first break on the BBC. Anthony Mingella didn't start writing Oscar winners immediately - he started writing scripts for Grange Hill.
If the BBC was to produce only non commercial programmes, what would it look like?
We would perhaps have a 38 part series on the atonal composers from 1948-1982, documentaries on cheese making (just like National Lampoon's European Vacation), endless round table discussions on coastal erosion in Namibia and perhaps programmes on Mongolian throat singing. Possibly a film or two from the Swedish national film collection, showing the early works of a particularly gloomy director, obscure Scottish poets, and redubbed vintage Eastern Bloc animation (and a documentary on said animation). Cheap and very worthy children's prgrammes (here's bran, kids!), a series about the abandoned footwear found on Hadrian's Wall (actually, I would happily watch this), and an adaption of a famous 1923 Slovak play all about peasants, in the orginal Slovak. And dont forget the OU!
Of course as soon as you put on this deeply high-brow stuff, the free-marketeers would immediately say that nobody watches this, and if they do, they should pay for it. Head they win, tails you lose.
In fact Sky was cheeky enough to try this argument some years ago about Eastenders - its popular, therefore commecial. In which case, it should be on Sky, which, although commercial, has produced remarkably few popular programmes.
The BBC has to supply a mixture, so as to inform, educate and entertain. Thats fine. I dont always want serious stuff. But, for those who think the BBC is dumbing down, this is the serious stuff from Radio 4 today. Thinking Allowed, Tweet of the Day, Start the Week (really good today), A Book of the Week about living in different houses, a drama about Syria, a documentary about horses on a housing estate. A History of Ideas, a series about the history of Mossad, an afternoon drama, a music quiz (with a lot of classical music), The Food Programme, a series about Scottish poets, Beyond Belief, a programme about the word Mongol(!), Crossing Continents, Shared Planet (about mangroves), The Book at Bedtime, and a programme about 'The Queen of African Music'. And of course Today, The World at One, PM, The World Tonight, and all the hourly news.
As for TV - have you seen BBC4? And there are some really good stuff on BBC3 - their Afghan programme is incrediably powerful.
'Arguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus. ' - Thats saloon bar handwaving. C5 has currently a £200m budget. Its makes bascially no content itself, buys its news in, and of course has no radio operation of any sort. And most of it is rubbish. You get what you pay for. BBC radio currently costs £650m - so almost double the £350m you suggest would cover everything. Your entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. Lets see the data behind your thinking.
I think that the BBC makes a good case here - BBC - Blogs - About the BBC - Why the licence fee is the best way to fund the BBC
What I find is that those who argue against the licence fee is that they have no workable alternative, and seem largely to have an ideological problem with it, rather than anything fundermentally practical.
@MikeB: I don't want to get into a slanging match throwing insults at each other.
I said that I respect the BBC. I'm a broadcaster myself, and have been for 11 years. I know what broadcasting costs, and haven't been 'seduced by an ideological viewpoint'.
My point is simply that much has changed since the Public Service Broadcasting remit of the BBC (and our other PSBs) was originally set up.
Any single organisation handed close to £4 Billion a year by the state cannot fail to have an impact on its sector. We in the UK have one of the finest broadcasting regimes in the world, and the creative industries collectively contribute around 8% of our GDP.
Briant Butterworth opened this thread with some valid reasoning for change. The last few years have seen immense disruption and change in 'television' in its many forms.
The BBC has no monopoly of truth nor of wisdom. Nor indeed do politicians. It must surely therefore be time for a re-examination of the BBC's role in what is a much wider canvas than could ever have been envisaged when it was set up. In most industries, the Competition Authorities worry about dominance of any single organisation over the sector.

Lorna Smith: Would that what you say about "Advert Free" was true; far from it! Program start and stop times are now disrupted by the Beeb's adverts for its own programs. As a retired broadcasting engineer, it was drummed into me at an early age that program schedule times MUST be adhered to, even if it meant using a stop watch and time signals.

Even under the strain of a budget crisis, the Community Oversight Board plans to continue its push for body cameras on all Nashville police officers as soon as possible.
"It's not enough anymore to say you don't have the money. This is important as living and breathing in this city," COB chair Ashlee Davis said Monday. "That's how important this is. That's not OK."
The board plans to issue a formal policy recommendation soon explaining their focus on transparency, as well as urging other departments to research possibly less expensive ways to store data and effectively use labor in processing video.
The board's executive team met Monday afternoon to assess a draft version of the recommendation they plan to issue to other stakeholders.
The board, which was established via a 2018 referendum approved by Nashville voters, is tasked with investigating allegations of police misconduct. The board also can recommend policy changes for the department.
Body, dash cameras on hold
A day after the board meeting, Mayor John Cooper announced plans to roll out a limited number of body cameras in 2020 while policy and cost questions are answered.
The city pulled back from a department-wide roll out last month amid a budget crisis and concerns over a mounting price tag.
Cooper's policy director John Buntin said it could cost more than $40 million per year to operate the cameras and analyze their footage, which he said was "deeply concerning" in the midst of a budget shortfall.
The delay has been tied to the state comptroller's urgent report to city leaders in November that Nashville was running out of money to pay its bills. The comptroller said officials must close a $41 million budget gap, or the state would take over the city's coffers.
The police department has about $10 million set aside to buy cameras, which have been a city priority since 2016. But city leaders have not decided how to handle millions in additional funds that could be needed as the body camera footage makes its way through the rest of the criminal justice system.
Downstream costs could come from outside the mayor's office and MNPD; prosecutors and public defenders said they'll need funding to review thousands of hours of footage that becomes relevant in criminal cases.
Monday's board meeting also included an update on the progress of the so-called Negotiation Task Force set up to allow representatives from the COB, mayor's office and MNPD to meet and negotiate the draft Memorandum of Understanding between the COB and MNPD.
Although the COB representative to the task force, Phyllis Hildreth, was not present at the meeting, due to being out of town, board member Matthew Sweeney confirmed the task force is making progress on discussing the articles of the MOU.
Also not present Monday was the board staff's newly-appointed Executive Director Jill Fitcheard, who was tied up at another meeting, the board was informed.
Fitcheard was named the new director last week after the unexpected resignation of William Weeden, announced Nov. 18.
Davis confirmed Monday that Fitcheard's salary would be updated to reflect her new position, effective as of the day last week she was named to the role.
"I have had a conversation with Director Fitcheard since our last meeting. I wanted to ensure she has all the support she needs," Davis said.
"Mrs. Fitcheard's commitment to the mission and purpose of the Community Oversight Board, and most importantly to the Nashville community, is unparalleled and her leadership has been instrumental to the success and continuity of the COB's efforts," Davis said in a statement last week. "The COB congratulates her on this deserving appointment and looks forward to this continued work and progress with her as our Executive Director."

I am using TCL version 8.5. I read text file through tcl script and count similar words frequency. I used for loop and dictionary to count similar words and their frequency but output of the program print like this: alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 1 delta 1
But I want to print it in one column each key, value pair of dictionary or we could say each key, value pair print line by line in output. Following is my script in tcl and its output at the end.
set f [open input.txt]
set text [read $f]
foreach word [split $text] {
    dict incr words $word
}
 puts $words

Output of the above script:
alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 1 delta 1

A: You would do:
dict for {key value} $words {
    puts "$key $value"
}

When reading the dict documentation, take care about which subcommands require a dictionaryVariable (like dict incr) and which require a dictionaryValue (like dict for)

For nice formatting, as suggested by Donal, here's a very terse method:
set maxWid [tcl::mathfunc::max {*}[lmap w [dict keys $words] {string length $w}]]
dict for {word count} $words {puts [format "%-*s = %s" $maxWid $word $count]}

Or, look at the source code for the parray command for further inspiration:
parray tcl_platform  ;# to load the proc
info body parray

I just started experiencing with the framework, and not everything is clear for me at the moment, so excuse me if my problem can be solved in some obvious way.
In my app I have login view controller with simple form contains two text fields (username and password) and a button. I would like the button to be disabled if any of two text fields is empty. So, I wrote this code:
RAC(self.loginButton, enabled) = 
[RACSignal combineLatest:@[self.userTextField.rac_textSignal,
                           self.passwordTextField.rac_textSignal]
                  reduce:^(NSString *username,
                           NSString *password) {
                      BOOL valid = (username.length > 0 &amp;&amp; password.length > 0);
                      return @(valid);
                  }];

It's very simple and it's working. The problem is that one of my text fields (the password field) has secureTextEntry and clearsOnBeginEditing properties set to YES. I will try to explain unwanted behavior that I am experiencing with this configuration:
Let's assume that both username and password fields are NOT empty. In this case the button is enabled. When user taps on password field, it becomes first responder (keyboard appears and user can enter his password), but because of clearsOnBeginEditing being set to YES for that field, the previously entered password is cleared from the text field. That's way password field is now empty. The problem is that signal is not being sent, so the button remains enabled, despite the password field is empty.
My first idea to solve this issue (well, more like workaround solution) was to observe isFirstResponder property on password field beside observing text changes. That's way the block that checks if button should be enabled would be called when password field becomes first responder. I don't know if this solution works, because I have no idea how to implement it using ReactiveCocoa. I have looking for creating a signal for isFirstResponder property changes, but without a luck. It might be not the best approach in order to solve this issue, but nothing comes to my mind at this point.
Then, the question is: how to observe isFirstResponder property with ReactiveCocoa?
And more general question: how to observe text field's text changes when clearsOnBeginEditing is set to YES?
UPDATE:
I found out that I can create signal for UIControlEventEditingDidBegin event that should give me substitution of observing isFirstResponder property changes:
[self.passwordTextField rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingDidBegin]

Unfortunately this does not solve the issue. Now I understand that field is cleared AFTER it becomes first responder, and clearing field automatically after it becomes first responder does not send signal for text changes. That's way when validation block is executed it still thinks that password field is not empty, and the button remains enabled despite password field was cleared and it's empty.

A: Unfortunately the -rac_textSignal only listens for UIControlEventEditingChanged. If  UIControlEventEditingDidBegin were added, you'd be all set.
I suppose you could patch this into it and submit a pull request?
- (RACSignal *)rac_textSignal {
    @weakify(self);
    return [[[[[RACSignal
        defer:^{
            @strongify(self);
            return [RACSignal return:self];
        }]
        concat:[self rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingChanged|UIControlEventEditingDidBegin]]
        map:^(UITextField *x) {
            return x.text;
        }]
        takeUntil:self.rac_willDeallocSignal]
        setNameWithFormat:@"%@ -rac_textSignal", [self rac_description]];
}

Charlie Baker says he's satisfied with the rollout of the state's first recreational marijuana retail stores.
"I think it's gone what I would describe, I guess, as mostly according to plan, which is a good thing," Baker told MassLive.
Two stores, Cultivate in Leicester and New England Treatment Access (NETA) in Northampton, opened on Nov. 20, the first retail pot shops east of the Mississippi.
The Cannabis Control Commission released figures Tuesday showing consumers spent $2.2 million at the two shops over their first five days operation, as Leicester residents complained of traffic problems. The Worcester county town's police chief, James Hurley, told residents at a Monday night emergency meeting that novelty of the new pot shop will eventually fade away.
The five-member commission and the new agency's staffers are processing applications for additional retail shops across the state.
"I think obviously for the commission this is the beginning and I'm anticipating that they'll learn as they go and if they need to make adjustments, they will," Baker said after an unrelated holiday event at Faneuil Hall. "But as I've said before, I thought the fact that they were deliberate in their approach to the rollout was the right way to pursue it."
Recreational marijuana sales begin last week at two stores in Massachusetts, the first to open on the East Coast.
Baker, who opposed marijuana legalization when the issue was on the 2016 ballot, said drugged driving remains his "biggest concern."
"It's very important that people recognize and appreciate the fact that this is not something they should be doing if they're planning to be driving," Baker said, pointing to ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as public transportation.
"I just hope people take that part seriously," he said.
In a public awareness campaign on impaired driving, Massachusetts public safety officials sought to equate operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana with doing so under the influence of alcohol.</span></div></div>

You love the outdoors. The beauty. The adventure. The chance to unplug. The quality time with family and friends, or even by yourself. Whether you choose to explore the wilds by hiking, on the water, with a fishing rod in hand, or up a mountain road with your camper, the remoteness and rawness of it all is likely part of the appeal.

Snakebites: Myth vs. Reality
By Ben Lerman on 6/4/18 11:40 AM
In the movies, snakes bite constantly, fly through the air to strike, and kill their victims almost instantly with their venomous bites. Those involved respond in all manner of ways, from trying to photograph and identify the snakes' species in 2006's Snakes on a Plane to cutting open the bite wound and attempting to suck out the poison in 2010's True Grit. Needless to say, these sensationalized portrayals can be misleading.

"Wound care is wound care, regardless of the type of mammal. I find that knowing the patient assessment system and other treatment principles is helpful, even with a dog. Pup has diarrhea? Palpate the abdomen to see if there's specific tenderness. Dog is lethargic? Consider 'ins and outs' and if that's affecting energy level. Reluctant to use an extremity? Try a usability test." - Missy White, NOLS Instructor

It's the first fair-weather Saturday of the month. Most people are sleeping in—but not you. It's time to fish!
Typically, you fish a barbless fly because you know it's easier to get the hook out of the fish's mouth, but today you and your buddy are trying to catch your limit for a fish-fry later. You choose an obnoxiously large streamer with the biggest, nastiest, barb you have in your fly-box.

The notion of CRM may not have been specifically top-of-mind among the Founding Fathers as they congregated during the unbearably hot summer of 1776 to hammer out the Declaration of Independence. Even so, relationships between citizens and their representatives were precisely what those early patriots were helping to define, and the traditionally poor service the government has delivered in the two centuries since would have had many of them scratching their wigs.
According to the latest scores from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), the federal government still lags behind the private sector when it comes to keeping people happy. This year, the feds scored a 68.9 out of a possible 100 points, while their commercial counterparts weighed in with a 75. The 68.9 score represented a 1.6 percent increase from last year, but the gap still remains. That turns out to be unsurprising, given rising consumer demands. "Look at most enterprises today and you can [almost always] get 24/7 service," explains Ben Madgett, an analyst for New York–based research firm Datamonitor. "There's an expectation there now that you should get the same from government."
The increasing expectations are also seen by Lisa Sherwin-Wulf, public-sector industry solutions manager for RightNow Technologies, a provider of on-demand customer experience solutions. Working with RightNow's 155 government-agency customers, there is growing pressure to increase operational efficiencies while at the same time ensuring that citizens can access any necessary information in their preferred channels. "People are expecting things like timely response by chat, interactive voice response, email, and Web forums…something in addition to just walking into an office or calling on the telephone," she explains. "The bar has definitely been raised."
Government agencies on all levels, though, may have quite a bit of catching up to do. Ken Landoline, vice president of research for Reno, Nev.–based analyst firm Synergy Research Group, declares the public sector "15 to 20 years behind the customer care contact center world." There is no doubt that many agencies are trying to improve their service offerings, but with a looming economic recession, less money to invest, and an ever-increasing population, will governments be able to catch up or just continue to run in place in the effort to provide citizen service? CRM takes a look at some agencies making the investment, amid others continuing to languish under the premise of "business as usual."
Madgett points to the e-government initiative that started approximately a decade ago as the moment when agencies determined they needed to bolster service to match what consumers were increasingly expecting from their retailers and other commercial engagements. "Certainly in the last five years there has been more of an uptake in this initiative," he says. "Governments are starting to realize what's out there and take advantage of using the Internet at its most basic level to provide service."
This can be seen as a win-win situation for many agencies, as technological innovations allow them to not only optimize their own processes but also cater to an increasingly Internet-fluent constituency. "Local government offices started to progress to online payments such as filing taxes," Madgett says. "As that relationship has evolved, [agencies are] now looking for something to manage that process—hence CRM—and so it's about providing that level of service and then cracking it as well with analytics to find out how many people are paying online, the issues they're having, and how agencies can help [provide a resolution]."
When it comes to CRM vendors able to hit the ground running with government outlets, Madgett points to typical big-name players including Oracle and SAP, but says others in the CRM world can cater to specific needs of different agencies on all levels. "You also have RightNow, Consona, and other smaller players who can hit more certain geographical markets, local government, and processes specific to them," he says.
Since government has been slower to adopt CRM, it has made many organizations loathe to stray from on-premises deployments to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Madgett's research finds there are more on-premises deployments in government than on-demand ones at this point—but that may start to change. "There are some [chief information officers] out there who have encouraged agencies to look more toward SaaS," he says. "There's a lot of possibility there. We're not totally there yet, but there's certainly a movement [developing]…. We're cautiously optimistic."
RightNow's Sherwin-Wulf says the movement's already arrived, with most of the 150 government agencies on her company's client list having already gone with SaaS, thanks to its lower costs, speed of deployment, and scalability. She reports that many of her company's customers decide to focus on the channel which will have the most significant impact first—generally Web self-service. After that, the customer can scale up as usage grows—similar to how the private sector does it. "Government agencies need to deal with these rising challenges in a timely manner," she says. "So they are becoming much more comfortable with that."
CRM ROADBLOCKS
So if government agencies are starting to grow more comfortable with deploying CRM to gain a more comprehensive view of the customer, then why haven't they all caught on? Madgett says there are several reasons: legal, operational, and cultural. It can start with terminology. "A lot of what we're talking about here is customer service, and the private sector–driven mentality to things," he says. "In the government space, there is a [reluctance] to refer to the citizen as a customer, and that mindset has to go away. You have to be comfortable with thinking of your citizens as customers, even if you don't call them that."
Madgett also says it gets back to barriers traditionally set up in government agencies sensitive to data they've been charged to collect and maintain. He explains that sharing information across agencies—for example, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense—is not necessarily a given. This runs counter to the traditional argument that CRM provides a 360-degree view of the customer (or in government's case, the constituent). There are also some restrictions on sharing private, sensitive data among different funnels. Add that to the siloed nature of many offices, and even when it's legal to share information, many will not come together, regardless of whether they're local, state, or federal. "There's a challenge there because there is tension between creating a comprehensive view and avoiding 'Big Brother,' " Madgett says.
Madgett says that, generally speaking, the government culture is already a slow adopter of technology. Implementing a CRM system at all can be an issue: At heart, CRM is a strategic solution before a technological one. To Madgett, it doesn't matter whether you're a government agency or a retail chain, recklessly adding new capabilities without first thinking about business benefits can lead to a doomed implementation. "You need someone who [understands] to champion this like [New York City Mayor Michael] Bloomberg with the 311 system," he says, referring to the city's citizen-information call-in number. "You can't just implement a call center or throw in a CRM system. You have to know your end goal and take the proper steps to figure out how to best allocate resources based on that." (See the NYC 311 chart, at right.)
DIAL 311 FOR EVOLUTION
Few cities have a larger constituency than New York City does. Boasting a population of more than 8 million people, the city decided back in 2002 to create a phone line for those living—and visiting—The Big Apple to be able to call for quick information. The service has never looked back since going live in 2003. "This is a great example of a concrete application of CRM," Madgett proclaims. "At 3 a.m., you can still call up 311 if you have a noise complaint, if something is wrong, there's a leak in your apartment…you can find out instantaneously. This is the type of service we have come to expect."
While the system has been deemed a success so far, that doesn't mean it hasn't had to make some adjustments, according to Joe Morrisroe, the deputy commissioner and executive director of 311 and www.nyc.gov, the city's official Web site. There have been many lessons learned during the continual efforts at service improvement, Morrisroe says. One maxim was to prepare ahead of time depending on the particular season. In the winter months, he explains, 311 puts information at the beginning of the interactive voice response (IVR) recording about guidelines concerning heat and hot-water complaints. "It's a way of educating the populace," he says.
Morrisroe says that pushing information to the beginning of the IVR allows callers to either ignore the message if it doesn't apply to them, or avoid having to wait for a representative to take the call. He admits call spikes can put a strain on the 311 system, but insists the city doesn't blindly rely upon the IVR—there are other safeguards in place to avoid a backlog of calls, he says. "We're staffed very well to ensure calls are answered quickly," he says. "We have organic growth in our call center; a lot of people in staff support—be it supervisors or team leaders—are former call-takers or have that skill set. We can mobilize people quickly and put them on the phones if necessary to help with the volume."
This can come into play as the economic recession threatens to freeze or cut the budgets of many government agencies. While it is not yet clear if the 311 system will be affected, Morrisroe says he's already taking safeguards to maintain high service quality. "The goal we have is not a lower-cost channel, but more of a self-service channel that can yield lower cost results," he says.
He explains that after being open for business the past five years, there is plenty of robust content that can be available to the populace via the IVR and Web in order to lessen the barrage of calls for live agents.
"We have answers to virtually any question someone in New York may have, and it is vetted by our organization as well as the requisite city agencies," Morrisroe says. "That's one of our main goals—and the economic pressure helps facilitate that a bit more: to push more information into the IVR and Web than we did in the past."
For Morrisroe, this is all in pursuit of the organization's mission. "Customer service is public service in action," he says. "That's a motto we carry with us."
ROCKY MOUNTAIN SELF-SERVICE
Ro Silva, public information and education manager in the taxpayer service division of the Colorado Department of Revenue (CODR), could be deemed a visionary for her time. Back in 1995, her agency began accepting email from stressed-out individuals who needed to send questions about tax inquiries without clogging the phone lines. "We were answering these [using] Microsoft Outlook," she recalls. "In 2000, we were getting and answering 14,000 emails a year, which was a lot for that time. I knew it was going to evolve into asking the same questions over and over again."
She turned to RightNow Technologies to create a Web self-service channel. Now, Colorado residents with questions come tax season can go to the department's Web site and look for answers before trying to email or call. In fact, Silva says, the system is set up so that Web-site visitors have to check out the "frequently asked questions" before being able to access the CODR email interface. Of course, that doesn't prevent residents from calling immediately. "People can make a phone call because those numbers are listed on our homepage, telephone book," she insists. "You can call us no matter what."
As a result of utilizing SaaS for its Web self-service, Silva was able to boost CODR's productivity, satisfaction, and cost-efficiency. The department has realized a return on investment of 8,732 percent, email volume has dropped by 45 percent, and the unit saved $700,000 over an 18-month period. And that doesn't even account for the peace of mind many residents have now when they can either find an answer quickly online, or be able to get through quickly to an agent with a more-complex question. "Our wait times are pretty good for a government agency…. They are about four minutes," she says. "Before RightNow, during peak season people waited for 20 minutes to speak with a tax representative."
While there are no plans to innovate further with RightNow at this time, Silva says that it lays the groundwork for what could be an extra-difficult season, with the recession hitting the state of Colorado particularly hard—a hiring freeze on all state employees started in October 2008. "We're not able to hire any new [employees], which works against us even though we have all these great services people can self-service through," she says. "It's going to hurt because…you still have people who have specific issues that need to be addressed, and it might mean they may not be able to get through as quickly."
Silva remains thankful that she has RightNow's system in place. Otherwise, they would have to shut down the email channel just to alleviate the pressure placed on the agents. "We just wouldn't be able to get to it all," she says.
GOVERNMENT 2.0—NEXT ON THE AGENDA?
The 800-pound gorilla in the room comes in the form of Web 2.0 technologies, including blogs, chat, forums, social networking sites, Twitter, and wikis. Filtering into the CRM world via the private sector, this is the next opportunity for innovation, according to Madgett. But, just as with traditional CRM deployments, strategy must be in place first. "Governments are slow to adopt, and especially with something like Web 2.0—where you get into using utilities like Twitter—they are experimenting with it but haven't captured what they want to do with it yet," he says. "It's good to adopt the technology but without a strategic framework the practical usage of it can be lost." (See this month's "CRM on Twitter," page 16, for a quick snapshot of some government twitterers.)
Karen Trebon, a program analyst with the General Services Administration's Office of Citizen Services, cites a plethora of examples of agencies at all levels starting to adopt varying forms of Web 2.0 technology to help inform and interact with their respective constituents. The examples run all the way to the top: With President Barack Obama in the White House now, she expects government to delve even deeper. From the Obama campaign's Web site to the transition team's efforts with www.change.gov to its revitalized www.whitehouse.gov, community participation clearly ranks high on the national public-policy scene. "One of the things that is driving this and will continue to [do so] is Obama coming into office," she says. "I think everybody can agree that he outclassed [Senator John] McCain in the use of the Web and technology. For the first time, I think we'll have a president…who is just as smart as all of us about technology."
Beyond Obama's potential, Trebon admits she also feels the heat from constituents demanding equality in the service they receive from both the public and private sectors. "People love Amazon.com and they expect to go on our Web site and love it just as much," she says. "We don't get allowances for being the government, so we have to keep up with what people want on the Web."
By Trebon's count, there are 37 active, public-facing, federal agency blogs right now, plus an untold number of efforts at the lower levels of government. "[Blogging] seems to be the most adopted form of Web 2.0 at this time," she says. "But a lot of these technologies are free or low-cost, so there is no worry about ROI or going and asking anyone for money."
So if that's the case, why aren't more agencies picking up on Web 2.0? She believes it has to do with bandwidth concerns, potential viruses, and actionable strategy. "I spoke with representatives from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and they deal with very serious information including the [number] of people who are incarcerated and on death row…and they're not sure how to take this information and use it on something like Facebook," she says. "To them, [that context] seems very lighthearted."
While that may be an extreme case, Trebon points to several instances in which using Web 2.0 can serve the people well. The bloggers at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) determined through blog comments that passengers were experiencing different rules at different airports, making unclear what rules were optional and which were absolutely mandatory, such as removing shoes before going through security. "[The TSA] actually used that information to tighten up the mandate across the country," she says. "That's an example of how Web 2.0 can actually achieve results. The TSA didn't just take comments from people on the Web, but actually made a process improvement."
Like blogs, Trebon says Twitter can also provide an opportunity to continue a dialogue with constituents, particularly during times of crisis. "We used it here in our office during the Mumbai incident," she says, referring to the December 2008 terrorist attacks. "People can follow our tweets to keep up to date on what's going on, where and how to call if you have family or friends in an area that's being affected by some form of calamity."
While still in its nascent stages, Government 2.0 has the potential to not only increase citizen satisfaction, but to offer a sense of transparency and, as a consequence, trust—a trait that's sometimes lacking but always essential to the democratic process. "The Obama team has been talking to us a lot about transparency and just putting more information out there," Trebon says. "The interactive nature of these technologies increases trust in government and makes people feel like they're being listened to because we're responding back to them."
SIDEBAR: 2 Tips to Contact Center Implementation Bliss
Gary Peckham, director of the contact center for the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Service, knows a thing or two about quickly revamping a contact center to adjust to a quick mandate. Back in 2000, his department was charged with providing landlord and tenant issues to an additional 800,000 Calgary citizens when the city decided to cease offering the services on its own. Peckham had four months to make it happen, and he says he turned to Avaya to "bring us into the new century."
Looking back at the pain of the initial implementation, he has a couple of tips for government agencies now looking to revamp their contact centers:
Make sure you listen to your employees. "We spent a lot of time dealing with Avaya's staff and making sure that we were understanding of them," he recalls. "However, we didn't spend enough time explaining to our workers why things had to happen in a certain sequence."
Weigh all the purchasing options, even if you don't want to "reinvent the wheel." "Government's mindset isn't necessarily the same as private business where you're always upgrading on an ongoing basis," he explains. "When we purchase a product we anticipate that it will last a certain period of time. Consistent upgrades are not built into the budget process. Had we leased the product, we could have had an easier time when we had to keep up with the changing times. We needed to look at other options and how that would have been beneficial to the taxpayer in the long haul."

By Ishan Ghosh
July 7, 2019 18:43 +08
USA and Netherlands are going to face each other in the final Twitter
The United States team will face Netherlands in the final of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2019 on July 7 at the Lon Olympic stadium in France. USA came into the final defeating England 2-1 whereas Netherlands entered the final courtesy a 1-0 win over Sweden.
Preview, prediction, schedule
The three-time world champions USA are coming into the final riding high on a hard fought win against England. They have been in magnificent form throughout the tournament and have not lost a single match. However, their star player and probably the player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe was out of the semi-final clash due to a hamstring injury. But the USA team management have announced that she will be fit for the final. The loss of such a big player would have been a major setback for the team. With her in the team, they will be looking forward to adding another trophy to their collection.
On the other hand, Netherlands who are now oozing with confidence after qualifying for the final, came into the cup decider by beating Sweden in a hard fought 1-0 win. The sole goal of the match came in the 99th minute. The 2017 European champions will be hoping that their star player Lieke Martens performs up to her usual high standard and gets fit for the final. She was one of the reasons behind the 2017 triumph so her presence will be very vital for the Orange Brigade.
The USA definitely have the upper hand over first time finalist Netherlands and are, definitely, the favourite to win. But Netherlands, who have been unbeaten for the last 12 matches, will not let them win easily. An exciting match is on the cards.
The USA-Netherlands match will start at 5 PM on July 7 according to local time and 11 pm, July 7 according to SGT.

World War I began with the smallest of incidents and turned into one of the most complex of global events, a lesson that should be heeded today, according to a panel of historians gathered at the Association of the U.S. Army on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into "the war to end all wars."
In 1914, the world was stable when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated in Bosnia. That "small event" launched the great war in Europe, said Michael S. Neiberg, chair of war studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College. And once war begins, "it can be virtually impossible to get out."
It took several years for the U.S. to agree to join the war, with politics playing a major role in that hesitation, Neiberg said. Once Congress agreed to enter the war on April 6, 1917, the U.S. military was unable to deploy quickly and took a year to be effective in Europe, he said.
Among the myths of the war is that the U.S. Army resisted working under French and British command, said Edward Lengel, chief historian of the White House Historical Association. In fact, "amalgamation" was happening by November 1917, "but the collaboration was not an easy one," he said.
The U.S. Army proved to be exceptionally adaptable as the war went on, he said.
The April 6 discussion was co-hosted by AUSA and the Center for Military Diplomatic History, which promotes the application of history to contemporary problems.

Everything but "todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).getText());" compiles correctly.
With that line, I get the following error message: "cannot resolve method getText()."
This is part of a class responsible for displaying each list row in a TODO checklist:
@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
    View rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.activity_main, parent, false);
    TextView todoText = (TextView) rowView.findViewById(R.id.todoText);
    todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).getText());
    return rowView;
}

I have no idea how to fix this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

A: Hard to say without seeing todoList declaration, but chances are that todoList is a List of Strings (or something else but a TextView). If that's the case, you may just need to do.-
todoText.setText(todoList.get(position));


A: I have no idea about the contents of your todoList but you can do a workaround if the content is not a String by using .toString() 
Try to change the code into -
todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).toString());

hope it works.

<p>Today we are releasing SlimPajama – the largest extensively deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset for training large language models. SlimPajama was created by cleaning and deduplicating the 1.2T token RedPajama dataset from Together. By filtering out low quality data and duplicates, we were able to remove 49.6% of bytes, slimming down the dataset from 1210B to 627B tokens. We believe SlimPajama offers the highest quality and most compute efficient data to train on for runs up to 627B tokens. When upsampled, we expect SlimPajama to perform equal to or better than RedPajama-1T when training at trillion token scale. </p>
<p>In addition to the data, we are also releasing the tools we built to create SlimPajama. Applying <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book0n.pdf">MinHashLSH</a> deduplication to trillion token datasets like RedPajama was not possible with off-the-shelf open-source code. We made several improvements to existing solutions to produce an infrastructure that can perform MinHashLSH deduplication on trillion token datasets in a distributed, multi-threaded, and memory efficient fashion. Today we are open-sourcing this infrastructure to enable the community to easily create higher quality, extensively deduplicated datasets in the future. </p>

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h2>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116">latest research</a> has shown that data quality is as important as data quantity. While training on more than one data epoch can be beneficial, this should be a choice rather than a side-effect of duplicates in the dataset. We decided to extensively deduplicate RedPajama to produce a dataset with higher information density. This means when using SlimPajama, you can achieve higher accuracy with the same compute budget when compared to other datasets.</p>
