The types of ambiguity are diverse and sometimes subtle, many of which are only apparent after examining evidence provided by a very large text corpus.

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>AmbigNQ, a dataset covering 14,042 questions from NQ-open, an existing open-domain QA benchmark. We find that over half of the questions in NQ-open are ambiguous. The types of ambiguity are diverse and sometimes subtle, many of which are only apparent after examining evidence provided by a very large text corpus.  AMBIGNQ, a dataset with
14,042 annotations on NQ-OPEN questions containing diverse types of ambiguity.
We provide two distributions of our new dataset AmbigNQ: a <code>full</code> version with all annotation metadata and a <code>light</code> version with only inputs and outputs.</p>
