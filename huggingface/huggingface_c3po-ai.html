impact of competition, the effect of economic and market conditions, litigation, the impact of current or pending legislation and regulation and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission reports.\nItem 2.&quot;:1,&quot;ITEM 1B. BUSINESS\nTransition Systems, Inc. (the \&quot;Company\&quot; or \&quot;TSI\&quot;) provides management information technology to hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician groups and other healthcare organizations. Using TSI products, these organizations are able to increase efficiency, improve quality of care and lower the cost of care delivery. TSI product lines span the health care organization's information technology needs, providing data integration services, master person identifier solutions, disease management products and a clinical data repository as well as enterprise-wide financial, operational and clinical decision support.\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\nPressure by employers, health insurers and government payors to control health care costs is driving a movement towards managed care and new forms of reimbursement for health care providers. These new managed care reimbursement models, including capitation, case rates, per diems and other fixed payment arrangements, are shifting the financial risk of providing care from payors to providers. Payors are also demanding that providers differentiate their services by demonstrating quality of care. These and other pressures are leading to industry consolidation and the formation of multi-entity provider networks, including integrated delivery networks.\nThese changes have altered the information needs of health care providers trying to compete in this new environment. Institutions must understand their costs in order to manage the profitability of their clinical processes and their many types of managed care contracts. Institutions also need to be able to compare practice patterns and outcomes of different clinicians or affiliated providers and to monitor utilization and outcomes on a continuous basis. Further, systems must be put in place that help clinicians translate their new understanding of improved care delivery into daily clinical operations. Information tools are required at the point of care that help clinicians improve their overall productivity as well as insure quality and cost effective care.\nThe existing information systems installed in most provider organizations were developed to meet the needs of providers in a fee-for-service environment. These systems are typically transaction-based departmental systems (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, radiology and nursing) focused on recording billing information for a single department. They are suitable primarily for collecting financial data, rather than for analyzing clinical and operational information. Existing departmental systems generally have been designed to operate as stand-alone systems and typically are limited in their ability to share data. Because these legacy systems do not integrate clinical, operational and financial data across the enterprise, they do not provide the information TSI believes is necessary for managers or clinicians to evaluate the cost of care by patient, clinical specialty or episode of care. Further, these systems were designed mainly to capture charges in a fee-for-service environment, rather than to lower costs, improve utilization and demonstrate quality.\nPRODUCTS\nTSI's initial product, Transition I, was introduced in 1985. Since 1985, TSI has developed new products on a regular basis. All TSI products extend the core concepts of management information, accountability and control. These products are based on the foundation of providing information technology tools that enable healthcare organizations to: analyze past clinical, operational and financial practices; model new approaches for the future; transform those models into actionable plans; and measure actual practice against those plans. Recent additions to the TSI product lines have extended these capabilities to include disease-specific tools that focus on improving the day-to-day efficiency and effectiveness of care providers as well as the real-time measurement of clinical protocols. TSI data sources have also expanded to include clinical data repository technology.\nThe focus of TSI products is to empower the enterprise with information that can be used to change and improve the clinical and financial performance of the organization. More than 1,100 healthcare organizations in the United States and abroad have chosen TSI as their information technology solution to support their ongoing improvement efforts.\nTSI's current product offerings are as follows:\nTransition II. At the core of the Transition family of products is Transition II, an integrated decision support system designed to provide the clinical, operational and financial information that is needed to manage and improve the delivery of care. Together, the clinical and financial components of Transition II enable an organization to: (i) delineate responsibility and accountability for managing costs; (ii) control resource utilization and reduce costs; (iii) measure variances from rules-based protocols on a daily basis; (iv) manage a mix of complex reimbursement contracts by case or member; (v) analyze and measure quantifiable improvements in the patient care process; and (vi) develop clinical and departmental budgets and variance analyses that adjust for actual volume and mix.\nTransition II creates a clinical and financial data repository by integrating data from across the enterprise. The system gathers information from the many departmental information systems within the organization through interfaces that enable concurrent updating of distributed data. Transition II analyzes this data in order to determine the patient-level costs of care and identify areas for improvement. This information allows the organization to evaluate its cost structure, make changes in clinical processes to reduce costs and accurately price reimbursement contracts on a profitable basis. Transition II also analyzes and measures clinical process and outcomes data, identifying the practice patterns that most consistently result in the highest quality at the lowest cost. In addition, the system includes capabilities for case mix, reimbursement and utilization management, cost and profitability analysis, strategic planning, modeling and forecasting.\nEnterprise Manager Series, formerly known as Transition II for Integrated Delivery Systems, contains several different components that meet the needs of emerging integrated delivery networks. This product incorporates the functionality of Transition II and extends it across multiple entities. It also adds capabilities designed to meet the special needs of integrated delivery networks, such as analyses focusing on groups of patient-members and their associated health care activities. Different types of members can be categorized, for example, by disease type, age, sex, insurance product or employer.\nEnterprise Manager Series includes tools to: (i) measure and monitor the cost and quality of care longitudinally and determine where in a provider network appropriate care can be provided most cost effectively; (ii) manage the financial risks of capitation; (iii) provide risk pool accounting and management both centrally and to physician groups; (iv) manage physician panels and determine panel sizing; (v) centrally identify and consolidate multiple patient identifiers across an enterprise and resolve them to a common master patient index; (vi) manage populations by identifying detailed characteristics and demographics, risk factors or chronic conditions, patient outcome status, and HEDIS and HEDIS-like indicators; and (vii) link physician and hospital billing information with the ability to view utilization, revenue and profitability by physician only, hospital only, and combined physician and hospital.\nEnterprise Person Identifier. This product is a vendor-neutral enterprise master person index that uniquely identifies and cross-references patient, person, or member identification numbers to link information stored in disparate systems. This product is increasingly essential for an organization delivering care at multiple sites to produce complete and accurate billing statements by capturing and correctly linking all visits and related charges incurred by patients throughout the network, regardless of the source of the data. This capability is also a necessary foundation for enterprise clinical systems, such as clinical data repositories and electronic patient records.\nDictionary Manager. Dictionary Manager enables users to input a change to semi-static data tables or dictionaries just once, and have that change immediately reflected in all designated systems automatically. Changes to the charge masters, the addition of new physicians to the users staff, and the elimination of an insurance provider are all updated and maintained accurately and automatically by Dictionary Manager.\nTransition IV. Transition IV, TSI's next generation of decision support solutions, extends the capabilities of Transition II by providing access to real-time clinical information that can be used to enhance the quality of patient care. Transition IV creates a domain of information to improve a healthcare organization's ability to perform care analysis, care planning, care support, and opportunity analysis. Transition IV provides a single desktop that incorporates the HealthVISION real time clinical data repository with the clinical and financial planning and analysis capabilities of Transition II. Transition IV is comprised of five additive levels of packaging to enable initial purchases or upgrades to any level. Among other benefits and features, Transition IV:\n- Provides detailed clinical information to use for process improvement\n- Minimizes re-work through real-time alerts\n- Provides real-time collection of clinical data through live HL7 feeds\n- Improves patient outcomes through timely intervention\n- Incorporates financial information in analysis and alerts\n- Provides Web-enabled physician desktop\n- Provides ease of access to timely data, such as laboratory test results\nTransition For Quality. TSI's Transition for Quality product offers tools that complement the analytical power of Transition II's clinical component and provides on-line case management. With Transition for Quality, an organization can define a broad range of quality issues and identify cases for review and follow up based on outcome measures and variance from critical paths. Using this information, the organization can concurrently monitor the progress and outcomes of cases and intervene in response to automatic alerts. In addition, Transition for Quality provides healthcare organizations with compliance tools to comply with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' Oryx initiative.\nTransition Perspective and Clinical ABCs. These benchmarking products offered in conjunction with products of Premier Inc. and HCIA, Inc., respectively, enable Transition II customers to use external benchmarking data to further support their process improvement efforts.\nVital Oncology. This product, developed by TSI's subsidiary, Vital Software, automates the clinical processes unique to medical oncology while enhancing the quality of care. Vital Oncology significantly increases the productivity of physicians and nurses, reduces the likelihood of error, and improves patient care.\nSERVICES AND SUPPORT\nImplementation Assistance. Almost all new sales of products and many sales of add-on products include implementation assistance. Implementation is carried out by a team of specialists overseeing the process on-site. Implementation of Transition II typically takes from six to twelve months.\nSoftware Maintenance Contracts. TSI offers software maintenance contracts for all software products. Under these contracts, TSI provides ongoing support, including updates and enhancements to the software modules and telephone access to a Help Desk staffed by an experienced team of support professionals.\nConsulting Services. TSI also offers post-implementation consulting services intended to assist customers in maximizing the benefits available through the use of the Transition family of products. TSI's staff can assess performance of the customer's system and advise the customer on its growing needs. While these services do not currently constitute a major source of revenue, TSI believes they have the potential to grow in importance.\nIntegration Services. TSI offers data extraction services to develop the conversion protocols necessary to obtain data feeds from an organization's source systems, so as to enable data from these source systems to be integrated with data from TSI applications. Typical extractions are from general ledger, payroll, admission/discharge/transfer, medical records abstracting, patient billing and various departmental systems. TSI also supports the installation of real time HL7 interfaces.\nCUSTOMERS\nTSI's customers include a broad range of hospitals, integrated delivery networks, managed care organizations and physician practices in the United States and around the world. TSI's products are installed at more than 1,100 customer sites.\nTECHNOLOGY\nTSI has products deployed on both two-tier client/server and three-tier client/server/server architectures. Each of the products utilizes the architecture strategy best suited for the data access requirements inherent to each product. This enables TSI to provide the power and flexibility of distributed data and processing combined with a wide range of user platforms. For example, each of Transition II, the Enterprise Manager Series and Transition IV comprises a broad range of integrated applications that draw from a central repository of patient-level clinical and financial data. They feature an open, three-tiered client/server/server architecture that includes, at the client level, a Microsoft Windows-compliant point-and-click interface. TSI believes these features differentiate these products from other available decision support products.\nMultiple Platforms. TSI's products are designed to operate with a variety of hardware platforms, operating systems and database management systems. This strategy enables TSI to provided a practical and affordable solution for small and mid-size group health plans and community hospitals as well as large teaching hospitals and vertically-integrated health care delivery networks. Microsoft Windows (3.1, 95, 98 and NT) is the client standard for all products. Transition II host tier options include IBM 370/390 mainframes running the Model 204 DBMS, IBM AS/400s with DB2/400 and UNIX servers (Hewlett-Packard HP9000 and IBM RS/6000) running the Oracle DBMS. The application tier requires an Intel based processor. The Enterprise Manager Series of products utilizes the Transition II architecture with a SQL Server component for specific population studies. Transition for Quality is offered on both the HP9000 and the RS/6000 running either Oracle or Sybase. Transition IV repository options include UNIX servers (HP9000, RS/6000) running either the Oracle, Sybase or Informix DBMS. The Transition IV application tier is an Intel processor running NT with the SQL Server DBMS. Vital Oncology utilizes an Intel processor running NT with the SQL Server DBMS.\nThree-Tiered Client/Server/Server Architecture. Transition II and Transition IV, together with the Enterprise Manager Series, employ a three-tiered computing architecture in which workstations (clients) and host-servers share the work of managing and processing information. This client/server environment allows a user to realize greater processing efficiency at a lower cost than traditional terminal/host or PC-LAN configurations.\nThe Data Server tier pulls data from an organization's disparate transaction system databases and other data sources and batch processes it daily into a value-added data repository. This tier performs the processing necessary to calculate unit costs, reimbursement, quality indicators and critical path variances. The system incorporates a variety of communications protocols, together with data interfaces developed during the system implementation process, to extract data from the disparate databases throughout an organization in which transnational cost, process and outcomes information is stored, allowing the organization to preserve its existing investment in information technology.\nThe Application Server, the middle tier, performs the value-added data integration, storage and access required to support the clinical and financial analysis of the data. This tier runs on Windows NT and requires the SQL Server DBMS. The Application Server relies on direct data feeds from the Data Server tier and provides SQL-compliant database structures to integrate other data sources and to handle ad-hoc queries among all tiers of the architecture.\nThe Client tier performs on-line clinical and financial analysis through a Microsoft Windows-compliant point-and-click interface. The Transition II, Enterprise Manager Series and Transition IV applications were developed using Microsoft's Visual Basic and Visual C++ development environments and are compatible with Windows 3.1, 3.11, Windows '95, Windows '98, Windows NT and other operating environments supported by the Microsoft Foundation Classes. The architecture has been expanded to incorporate a Visual Basic rapid\ndevelopment strategy exploiting Microsoft's ActiveX, COM/DCOM and Web enabling directions. With Transition II, the Enterprise Manager Series and Transition IV, there is no need to layer a separate executive information system on top of the application. Instead, the product includes a graphical, mouse-driven user interface which allows even inexperienced users to navigate through intuitive screens and windows of information, to select the information to be reviewed at various levels of detail and to transform numerical data into charts and graphs. The system can be customized to set user preferences, display styles and sorting parameters, enabling users to develop their own objects and applications.\nThe system provides tightly coupled interfaces to CCA Model 204, DB2/400, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. Additionally, each of Transition II, the Enterprise Manager Series and Transition IV system integrates external data through compliance with the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and OLE 2.0 (Object Linking and Embedding) protocols. ODBC provides standard SQL connectivity to a variety of SQL-compliant relational and non-relational databases, while the OLE 2.0 protocol provides a display, update and editing environment for Windows programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and PC SAS. As a result, additional data from a customer's legacy systems can be used in its native form without the need for data import.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nAt September 30, 1998, TSI had a direct sales force of 23, consisting of 19 direct sales persons and four sales management executives organized in two geographic regions covering the United States and Canada. TSI's direct sales and sales management personnel are compensated through salaries plus commissions based on quarterly and annual quotas. TSI also sells through distributors based in New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands. Distributors provide local support for implementations and ongoing maintenance support.\nTSI uses periodic newsletters and press releases, participation in trade shows, direct mail and telemarketing to generate and pursue leads. Company employees also speak at health care industry conferences and publish case studies and articles. TSI sponsors annual user group conferences at which customers can learn about TSI's new product offerings and exchange information about their own experiences with TSI's products. TSI's May 1998 user group conference attracted approximately 1,300 attendees.\nBACKLOG\nAt September 30, 1997 and 1998, the Company's backlog was $17.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively. The Company includes in backlog all unrecognized revenue attributable to signed contracts for software sales and implementation and deferred revenue associated with maintenance contracts. The Company had $7.1 million and $7.9 million of deferred revenue associated with maintenance contracts at September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Of its backlog of $16.3 million at September 30, 1998, the Company estimates that approximately 90% will be recognized as revenue during the twelve-month period following such date. There can be no assurance, however, that orders included in backlog will generate revenues in the amount estimated or that such revenues will be recognized during the specified twelve-month period.\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for health care information systems and services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. TSI competes directly with other vendors of decision support systems to health care providers. Other vendors of health care information systems, including vendors currently targeting decision support systems for payors, may enter the markets in which TSI competes. TSI also faces competition from internal management information systems departments of large hospital networks, many of which have developed or may develop financial and clinical outcomes management systems or other cost control solutions. TSI believes that the principal competitive factors influencing the market for its products include vendor and product reputation, product architecture, functionality and features, ease of use, rapidity of implementation, quality of customer support, product performance and price. Competition may result in significant price reductions, decreased gross margins, loss of market share and lack of acceptance of TSI's products. There can be no assurance that\nTSI will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on TSI's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nTSI's products consist primarily of internally-developed software. In addition, TSI has incorporated in its products DBMSs, graphical user interfaces, and other software developed by third-party vendors. TSI believes that the timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products is essential to maintaining its competitive position in the market and positioning itself as an innovator. Since TSI's inception in 1985, TSI has developed and released functionality upgrades as well as new products on a yearly basis.\nTSI's current research and development efforts include expanding the capabilities of Transition IV and extending the Vital Oncology product to additional disease-specific applications. In addition, enhancements are planned for the Enterprise Person Identifier, Dictionary Manager and Transition for Quality products.\nTSI's research and development activities are conducted in its Boston office. As of September 30, 1998, its research and development staff consisted of 63 employees. TSI's total research and development expenditures were $4.6 million in fiscal 1997.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nTSI's ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on its ability to protect its proprietary information. TSI relies primarily on trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights.\nTSI generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its consultants, key employees and sales representatives and generally controls access to and distribution of its software and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use TSI's products or technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently. Although TSI intends to defend its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by TSI to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its intellectual property or that TSI's competitors will not independently develop software that is substantially equivalent or superior to TSI's software.\nTSI is subject to the risk of alleged infringement by it of the intellectual property rights of others. Although TSI is not currently aware of any material infringement claims with respect to TSI's current or future products, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims or that any such claims will not require TSI to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims. No assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that, if available, such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce TSI's intellectual property rights, to protect TSI's trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on TSI's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of September 30, 1998, TSI had 216 full-time employees, including 98 in operations, 63 in research and development, 36 in sales and marketing and 19 in general administration and finance.\nTSI believes its future success will depend in large part upon the continued service of its key technical and senior management personnel and upon TSI's continuing ability to attract and retain highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for highly-qualified personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that TSI will be able to retain its key managerial and technical employees or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future. None of the Company's employees is represented by a labor union. TSI has not experienced any work stoppage and considers its relationships with its employees to be good.\nITEM 2.&quot;:1,&quot;ITEM 1B. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\nThe executive officers of the Company and their ages are as follows:\nNAME AGE POSITION - ----- --- -------- Thomas A.

Sales in the Electronics segment decreased by $756,000 to $2,884,000 in 1996.\nConsolidated sales totaled $56,229,000 for 1995, an increase of 75% over sales of $32,098,000 in 1994. Aircraft Maintenance segment sales increased by $17,238,000 to $42,641,000 in 1995, primarily as a result of its continued expansion into the third party commercial aircraft maintenance market. Sales in the Ocean Systems segment increased by $6,126,000 to $9,948,000 in 1995. Revenues in the Ocean Systems segment increased primarily as a result of new product sales in the commercial geophysical market. Sales in the Electronics segment increased by $767,000 to $3,640,000 in 1995.\nThe Company recorded an operating loss of $9,996,000 in 1997 compared to an operating profit of $5,705,000 in 1996. The Aircraft Maintenance segment reported an operating loss of $9,764,000 in 1997 compared to an operating profit of $7,026,000 in 1996 primarily due to the increase in environmental reserves (see \&quot;Environmental Matters\&quot; above), an increase in the provision for obsolete inventory, and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance was increased because of disputes with large customers (the ultimate outcome of which can not be determined at this time) and certain customers in weak financial condition, including two customers that went into bankruptcy. The Electronics segment reported an operating loss of $6,000 in 1997 compared to an operating profit of $557,000 in 1996. The Electronics segment was sold in March 1997. Corporate office general and administrative expenses decreased to $337,000 in 1997 compared to $968,000 in 1996. This decline was the result of lower insurance and legal expense reserves, as well as a reduction in corporate staff and staff expenses.\nThe Company recorded an operating profit of $5,705,000 in 1996 compared to an operating profit of $2,875,000 in 1995. The Aircraft Maintenance segment reported an operating profit of $7,026,000 in 1996 compared to an operating profit of $3,430,000 in 1995. The improved profitability in the Aircraft Maintenance segment resulted primarily from the increase in sales. The Company increased its sales to its three largest customers in 1996 over those same customers in 1995, mainly because those customers had increased the size of their fleets. The Ocean Systems segment reported an operating loss of $789,000 in 1996 compared to an operating profit of $419,000 in 1995. The decline in sales was the primary reason for the 1996 operating loss in the Ocean Systems segment. The Electronics segment reported an operating profit of $557,000 in 1996 compared to an operating profit of $796,000 in 1995. The decline in sales was the primary reason for the lower 1996 operating profit in the Electronics segment. Corporate office general and administrative expenses decreased to $968,000 in 1996 compared to $2,128,000 in 1995 primarily as a result of reductions in legal and insurance expenses.\nOther expense, net in 1997 includes the $4,500,000 writedown of the Company's investment in Hydroscience\nTechnologies, Inc. (HTI) preferred stock (See Item 1B). Other income in 1996 includes interest earned of $307,000 and investment income of $440,000. Other income in 1995 includes gains on sales of fixed assets of $650,000 and interest earned of $671,000. Other income in 1994 includes gains on sales of fixed assets of $512,000 and interest earned of $791,000.\nThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3,610,000 in 1997. The Company recorded net income tax expense of $2,206,000 for 1996 and $889,000 in 1995.\nYEAR 2000 ISSUE\nThe Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year. Any of the Company's computer programs that have date-sensitive software may recognize a date using '00' as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. If the Company's systems are unable to recognize or properly treat the year 2000, critical financial and operational information may be processed incorrectly. The Company has not yet assessed the year 2000 compliance expense and related potential effect on the Company's earnings.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDuring 1997, cash used in operating activities totaled $4,545,000 as compared to $4,084,000 in 1996 and $1,802,000 in 1995.\nThe Company made capital expenditures during 1997 of approximately $3,739,000 compared to $4,438,000, and $1,668,000 in 1996 and 1995. The majority of the capital expenditures in all years were made to renovate the Aero facility in Lake City, Florida. All planned major expansions have been completed as of December 31, 1997. Including in 1997 capital expenditures was the construction of a building and the purchase of other items for the C-130 contract and the completion of the refinishing of various hanger floors. However, the Company will make capital and other expenditures during 1998 as conditions warrant.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased from approximately $2,656,000 at December 31, 1996, to $1,251,000 at December 31, 1997. During 1997, the Company borrowed an additional $7,163,000 on its line of credit primarily to fund working capital, the acquisition of the Macon, Georgia facility, and capital expenditures of $3,739,000. At December 31, 1997, there was approximately $2,287,000 available under the line of credit.\nThe Company believes that, despite the losses generated in 1997 mainly attributable to the increase in the accounts receivable reserve, the increase in the environmental reserve, and the writedown of its investment in the HTI Preferred Stock, its cash balances and line of credit facility are sufficient to meet its short and long-term capital requirements. The Company intends to continue to pursue opportunities for the acquisition of aircraft maintenance facilities, and any future acquisitions may require additional capital. In order to provide additional funds for the Company's growth strategies and for operations over the long-term, the Company may incur, from time to time, additional short and long-term bank indebtedness and may issue, in public or private transactions, equity and debt securities. The availability and terms of such securities may depend upon market and other conditions. There can be no assurances that such potential financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements made under Item 7, about anticipated results, liquidity and capital resources and statements made under Item 1 concerning the anticipated growth of worldwide air traffic and the expected trend toward greater outsourcing by commercial air carriers and the US Military. Such forward-looking statements are based upon known and unknown assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from such expectations include, but are not limited to, those associated with general economic and business conditions, aircraft and aerospace industry trends, availability of financing, and the inability or failure to identify or consummate successful acquisitions or to assimilate the operations of any acquired businesses with those of the Company.\nITEM 8.&quot;:1,&quot;ITEM 1B.

Controls and Procedures\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \&quot;Exchange Act\&quot;), as of December 31, 2000. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties discussed below, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that the Company's disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses discussed below, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements and that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2000 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on management's assessment, including consideration of the control deficiencies discussed below, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2000, because there was a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, through the investigation discussed above, management identified a lack of segregation of duties as well as errors in financial statement presentation and disclosure.\nLack of Segregation of Duties\nManagement is aware that there is a lack of segregation of duties at the Company due to the lack of employees dealing with general administrative and financial matters. However, at this time management has decided that considering the abilities of the employees now involved and the control procedures in place, the risks associated with such lack of segregation are low and the potential benefits of hiring employees to clearly segregate duties do not justify the substantial expenses associated with such increases. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.\nIn order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that this will lessen the possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are not \&quot;large accelerated filers\&quot; nor \&quot;accelerated filers\&quot; under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.&quot;:1,&quot;Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nNOT APPLICABLE.\nPART III\nItem 10.&quot;:2,&quot;ITEM 9a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risks inherent in IRET's business include:\nChanges in market values of owned securities. On April 30, 2000, IRET owned $2,601,420 of GNMA securities which it intends to hold to maturity and $572,811 of common stock of other real estate investment trusts which it may sell.\nChanges in interest rates payable by IRET on its indebtedness. As of 04/30/00, IRET owed $6,452,420 on its credit line which is tied to the New York Prime interest rate; $10,087,256 on investment certificates of which $6,115,525 will come due during Fiscal year 2001 and will either be renewed at the then prevailing interest rates or redeemed, and $265,056,767 of mortgage loans secured by individual buildings, $22,711,952 of which is subject to variable interest rate agreements and none of which will come due in Fiscal 2001 and $9,072,618 which will come due in Fiscal 2002 and the balance in later years. IRET has not entered into any interest rate hedge or other such agreements with respect to its indebtedness or business.\nITEM 10.&quot;:1,&quot;Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our managing partner's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision of our managing partner's principal executive officer and principal financial officer we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our adopted disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our managing partner's president and treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter.\nPART III\nItem 10.&quot;:1,&quot;Item 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nPresent management of the Company concluded that, during the material times of this report, inadequate and ineffective controls and procedures were in place. Specifically, although the Company was dormant and conducted no known financial transactions, prior management does not appear to have kept adequate records or notes that would have enabled present management to effectively certify the activities of the Company.\nDuring the time period of this report, the Company was dormant. Although statutory provisions that now exist regarding management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the registrant did not exist, management still had a fiduciary duty to do so. However, to the best of the knowledge of present management, no adequate internal controls existed and records were not kept. Present management believes that prior management should have maintained entries into their books even though no transactions occurred. Therefore, present management does not believe that the internal controls were effective.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal year that is the subject of this report, management's report was not subject to attestation by the company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report.\&quot;\nThere were no changes to internal control over financial reporting during this fiscal year.\nITEM 9B.&quot;:1,&quot;&quot;:46981,&quot;ITEM 9 A Controls and Procedures\nNot Applicable\nPART III\nITEM 10.&quot;:1,&quot;ITEM 9A.

This evaluation was carried out under the supervision of the Company's management, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, Treasurer, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are currently effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company's periodic SEC filings.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management, which consists only of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, Treasurer, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nChanges in Internal Controls.\nThere have been no changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.\nPART III\nITEM 10.&quot;:1}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;section_9B&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;section_9B&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;string_label&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;no_label_count&quot;:0,&quot;no_label_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;n_unique&quot;:6,&quot;frequencies&quot;:{&quot;&quot;:46994,&quot;ITEM 9B.

Business\nGeneral\nSouthern California Water Company (the \&quot;Registrant\&quot;) is a public utility company engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water. The Registrant also distributes electricity in one community. The Registrant, regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (\&quot;CPUC\&quot;), was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of California as American States Water Services Company of California as the result of the consolidation of 20 water utility companies. From time to time additional water companies and municipal water districts have been acquired and properties in limited service areas have been sold. The Registrant's present name was adopted in 1936.\nAt December 31, 1993, the Registrant provided service in 17 separate operating districts, 16 of which were water districts and one an electric district, located in 75 communities in ten counties throughout the State of California. Total population of the service areas on December 31, 1993 was approximately 1,000,000. As of that date, about 73% of the Registrant's water customers were located in the greater metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. The Registrant provided electric service to the City of Big Bear Lake and surrounding areas in San Bernardino County. All electric energy sold is purchased from Southern California Edison Company (\&quot;SCE\&quot;) on a resale rate schedule.\nThe Registrant served 236,985 water customers and 20,131 electric customers at December 31, 1993, or a total of 257,116 customers compared with 255,966 total customers at December 31, 1992. For the year ended December 31, 1993, approximately 90% of the Registrant's operating revenues were derived from water sales and approximately 10% from the sale of electricity, ratios which are generally consistent with prior years. Operating income before taxes on income of the electric district was 9.2% of the Registrant's total operating income before taxes. The material contained in Note 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders provides additional information on business segments while Note 13 provides information regarding the seasonal nature of the Registrant's business. Page 15 of the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders lists the geographical distribution of customers.\nDuring 1993, the Registrant supplied, from all sources, a total of 178,196 acre feet of water compared with 172,500 acre feet for the previous year. Of the total water supplied in 1993, approximately 43% was purchased from others, principally from member agencies of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\&quot;MWD\&quot;), and 1% was furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation under contract, at no cost, for the Registrant's Arden-Cordova District and to the Registrant's Clearlake district by prescriptive right to water extracted from Clear Lake. These amounts reflect a continued reduction in reliance on imported water supplies.\nThe MWD is a water district organized under the laws of the State of California for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas within its jurisdiction which includes most of coastal Southern California from the County of Ventura south to and including San Diego County. The Registrant has 52 connections to the water distribution facilities of MWD and other municipal water agencies. MWD imports water from two principal sources: the Colorado River and the State Water Project (\&quot;SWP\&quot;). Available water supplies from the Colorado River and the SWP have historically been sufficient to meet most of MWD's requirements even though the State's major reservoirs were significantly impacted by six years of drought. The drought officially ended in February, 1993. The price of water purchased from MWD, however, is expected to continue to increase. MWD announced a 7% rate adjustment on March 8, 1994, effective for the 1994-1995 fiscal year.\nIn those districts of the Registrant which pump groundwater, overall groundwater conditions continue to maintain at adequate levels. The Registrant drilled six new wells during 1993 in order to improve the Registrant's ability to use more groundwater in its resource mix and further decrease its dependence on purchased water.\nThe Registrant is continuing its efforts to become a participant in the Coastal Aqueduct extension of the State Water Project (the \&quot;Project\&quot;). The Registrant believes that participation in the Project is necessary in order to provide another source of water for its Santa Maria water district. Should the Registrant be allowed to participate in the Project at a 500 acre-foot level, the Registrant will prepare a filing with the CPUC in order to recover costs associated with that participation under normal rate-making methods. A final decision of the CPUC on the application would not be anticipated until late 1994 or early 1995.\nRates and Regulation\nThe Registrant is subject to regulation by the CPUC as to its water and electric business and properties. The CPUC has broad powers of regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities, rates, classifications of accounts, valuation of properties and the purchase, disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service. It also has authority over the issuance of securities, the granting of certificates of convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters.\nWater rates of the Registrant vary from district to district due to differences in operating conditions and costs. Each operating district is considered a separate entity for rate-making purposes. The Registrant continuously monitors its operations in all of its districts so that applications for rate changes may be filed, when warranted, on a district-by-district basis in accordance with CPUC procedure. Under the CPUC's practices, rates may be increased by three methods - general rate increases, offsets for certain expense increases and advice letter filings related to certain plant additions. General rate increases typically are for three year periods and include \&quot;step\&quot; increases in rates for the second and third years.\nGeneral rate increases are established by formal proceedings in which the overall rate structure, expenses and rate base of the district are examined. Rates are based on estimated expenses and capital costs for a forward two-year period. A major feature of the proceeding is the use of an attrition mechanism for setting rates for the third of the three year test cycle assuming that the costs and expenses will increase in the same proportion over the second year as the increase projected for the second test year increased over the first test year. The step rate increases for the second and third years are allowed to compensate for the projected cost increases, but are subject to tests including a demonstration that earnings levels in the district did not exceed the latest rate of return authorized for the Registrant. Formal general rate proceedings typically take about twelve months from the filing of a Notice of Intent to increase rates to the authorization of new rates.\nRate increases to offset increases in certain expenses such as costs of purchased water, energy costs to pump water, costs of power purchased for resale and groundwater production assessments are accomplished through an abbreviated \&quot;offset\&quot; procedure that typically takes about two months. CPUC regulations require utilities to maintain balancing accounts which reflect differences between specific offset cost increases and the rate increases authorized to offset those costs. The balancing accounts are subject to amortization through the offset procedure or through general rate decisions.\nAn advice letter, or rate base offset, proceeding is generally undertaken on an order of the CPUC in a general rate proceeding wherein the inclusion of certain projected plant facilities in future rates is delayed pending notification that such facilities have actually been placed in service. The advice letter provides such notification and, after CPUC approval, permits the Registrant to include the costs associated with the facilities in rates.\nDuring 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Registrant's rates for all water districts were increased, among other reasons, to directly offset increases in certain expenses, principally purchased water, as well as increased levels of capital improvements. The Registrant decreased rates in its Bear Valley electric district by approximately 28% in November, 1991 as a result of amortizing large refunds from the Registrant's wholesale power supplier. The following table lists information related to the Registrant's rate increases for the last three years:\nThe Registrant filed an application for general rate increases in six of its water operating districts in May, 1992. In June, 1993, the CPUC issued its decision and the Registrant requested rehearing on two matters - the rate of return on rate base and an authorized rate increase for the Registrant's Bay Point water district. The CPUC granted the Registrant's request for rehearing on the two issues and established an interim rate of return on rate base of 9.5% applicable for certain attrition, step rate filings and other earnings test filings with respect to the Registrant's other operating districts. For further information, please see the caption \&quot;Rates and Regulation\&quot; under Management's Discussion and Analysis herein and Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.\nThe Registrant has filed its case on the two matters set for rehearing, which was held on March 15, 1994. Prior to commencement of hearings, the Registrant and the Division of Ratepayer Advocates (\&quot;DRA\&quot;) of the CPUC had stipulated to a rate of return on common equity of 10.10%. In addition, DRA had agreed that an increase in rates applicable to the Registrant's Bay Point water district was appropriate with certain modifications as to the level of rate base. A final decision on these matters, however, is still subject to the CPUC and is not expected until the Summer of 1994.\nThe Registrant anticipates filing applications with the CPUC in July, 1994 for rate increases, effective in 1995, in all of its operating districts for certain cost-effective recommendations resulting from the recently completed Management Audit of the Registrant conducted under the auspices of the CPUC. In addition, the Registrant will file a general rate case in one of its water operating districts. The requested annual increase in rates will also seek step increases for 1996 and 1997. No assurance can be given that the CPUC will authorize any or all of the rates for which the Registrant applies.\nIndustrial Relations\nThe Registrant had 486 paid employees as of December 31, 1993. Seventeen employees in the Bear Valley Electric District were members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Their present labor agreement is effective through June 30, 1994. Seventy-three of the Registrant's water utility employees, unionized under the Utility Workers of America (\&quot;UWA\&quot;), are covered by a contract which expires March 31, 1996. The Registrant has no other unionized employees.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (\&quot;EPA\&quot;), under provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, is required to establish Maximum Contaminant Levels (\&quot;MCL's\&quot;) for the 83 potential drinking water contaminants initially listed in the Act, and for an additional 25 contaminants every three years thereafter. The California Department of Health Services (\&quot;DOHS\&quot;), acting on behalf of the EPA, administers the EPA's program.\nThe Registrant continues to test its wells and water systems for more than 90 contaminants. Water from wells found to contain levels of contaminants above the established MCL's has either been treated or blended before it is delivered to customers. Only 2 of the Registrant's 306 wells have been permanently taken out of service due to high levels of contamination.\nThe Registrant is aware of two new rules pending implementation by the EPA which may significantly affect the Registrant: the Radon Rule and the Arsenic Rule. The EPA did not meet the October 1, 1993 deadline for establishing an MCL for radon. Because of this inaction, the rule is presently in the hands of the United States Congress where it is believed that an MCL will be established primarily to implement the regulation. However, the 1994 budget as drafted by the Appropriations Committee has specifically excluded funds for further work on radon regulation, basically setting a moratorium on the regulation. The EPA is continuing its review of data on the Arsenic Rule although the Registrant anticipates an MCL will be proposed by September, 1994. The Registrant is unable to predict, until the MCL's are established, what effects, if any, these new rules will have on its financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Registrant has experienced increased operating costs for testing to determine the levels (if any) of the contaminants in the Registrant's source of supply and costs to lower the level of any contaminants found to a level that meets standards. Such costs and the control of any other pollutants may include capital costs as well as increased operating costs. The rate-making process provides the Registrant with the opportunity to recover capital and operating costs associated with water quality, and management believes that such costs are properly recoverable.\nItem 2&quot;},&quot;section_1A&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;section_1B&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;section_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 2 - Properties\nFranchises, Competition, Acquisitions and Condemnation of Properties\nThe Registrant holds the required franchises from the incorporated communities and the counties which it serves. The Registrant holds certificates of public convenience and necessity granted by the CPUC in each of the 17 districts it serves.\nThe business of the Registrant is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies. The Registrant's certificates, franchises and similar rights are subject to alteration, suspension or repeal by the respective governmental authorities having jurisdiction over such matters.\nThe laws of the State of California provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, also known as condemnation. The Registrant has been, within the last three years, involved in activities related to the condemnation of its Big Bear and Bay Point water districts. The Registrant continues to oppose the condemnation actions with respect to its Bay Point water district initiated by the Contra Costa Water District in 1992. Note 8 of the Notes to Financial Statements contained in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders herein describes condemnation actions related to the Registrant's properties in greater detail.\nWater Properties\nAs of December 31, 1993, the Registrant's physical properties consisted of water transmission and distribution systems which included over 2,560 miles of pipeline together with services, meters and fire hydrants and approximately 438 parcels of land (generally less than 1 acre each) on which are located wells, pumping plants, reservoirs and other utility facilities. The Registrant's operating properties have been maintained and improved in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant owned and operated 306 wells equipped with pumps with an aggregate capacity of 265.7 million gallons per day (\&quot;MGD\&quot;). Other production facilities include filter plants with an aggregate capacity of 29.4 MGD and 52 connections to the water distribution facilities of the MWD and other municipal water agencies. The Registrant's storage reservoirs and tanks have an aggregate capacity of 156.6 million gallons. There are no dams in the Registrant's system.\nElectric Properties\nThe Registrant's electric properties are all located in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant operated 28.8 miles of overhead 34.5 KV transmission lines, 0.6 miles of underground 34.5 KV transmission lines, 172.7 miles of 4.16 KV or 2.4 KV distribution lines, 41.7 miles of underground cable and 14 sub-stations. There are no generating plants in the Registrant's system.\nOther Properties\nThe Registrant's general offices are housed in a single-story office building located in San Dimas, California. The land and the building, which was completed and occupied in early 1990, are owned by the Registrant. Certain of the Registrant's district offices are housed in leased premises.\nDuring 1993, the Registrant refinanced a significant portion of its then outstanding debt in order to lower interest costs. In doing so, the Registrant redeemed all outstanding First Mortgage Bonds. In early 1994, the Trustee filed for release of the lien of an indenture securing the previously outstanding First Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant had no mortgage debt outstanding.\nFinancing of Construction Expenditures\nThe Registrant's construction program is designed to ensure its customers with high quality service. The Registrant has an ongoing distribution main replacement program, throughout its service areas, based upon the priority of leaks detected, fire protection enhancement and a reflection of the underlying replacement schedule. In addition, the Registrant upgrades its electric and water supply facilities and is aggressively scheduling meter replacements. The Registrant anticipates gross capital expenditures of $26,700,000, $17,500,000 and $34,500,000 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.\nDuring 1993, the Registrant issued 1,107,000 Common Shares (on a post-split basis) in two separate public offerings for aggregate net proceeds of $23,935,000. The net proceeds were applied against then outstanding short-term bank borrowing incurred to temporarily finance construction expenditures.\nThe Registrant issued additional common equity through its Dividend Reinvestment and Common Share Purchase Plan and its 401-k Plan. The Registrant issued 47,828, 28,416 and 29,146 shares under the Dividend Reinvestment and Common Share Purchase Plan in the three years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The Registrant issued 7,741 and 7,102 Common Shares under the 401-k Plan in the two years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992. The Registrant did not issue any Common Shares through its 401-k Plan in the year ended December 31, 1991.\nDuring 1993 and 1992, the Registrant did not undertake any long-term debt financing to provide additional funds for construction. In 1993, however, the Registrant did refinance $37 million of its long-term debt, in order to reduce interest expense, through its Medium Term Note Program. In 1992, the Registrant entered into a $2,247,000 fixed rate obligation due 2013 for financing construction of a new reservoir serving one of the Registrant's water operating districts.\nIn May, 1991, the Registrant completed the sale of $28,000,000 in long-term Notes Due 2031, $13,500,000 of which was used to repay then outstanding short-term bank loans which had been used to fund the Registrant's construction program. In addition, in December, 1991, the Registrant redeemed, at a premium, $6,000,000 principal amount of 11-3/4% Notes. The remainder of the proceeds from the May, 1991 issue was utilized to fund the Registrant's capital expansion program.\nItem 3.&quot;},&quot;section_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nOn October 20, 1993, the Registrant and the Internal Revenue Service (\&quot;IRS\&quot;) reached a tentative settlement on the results of the IRS examination of the Registrant's 1987, 1988 and 1989 tax returns. Based on the settlement, the Registrant remitted an additional $438,000 in taxes. The Registrant anticipates signing the final agreement in late March, 1994.\nOn March 8, 1994, the Registrant and the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors (the \&quot;County\&quot;) reached a tentative settlement of issues related to the County's taking on the Registrant's Madison Treatment plant in its Bay Point water district. The County's Highway Department had taken possession of the property on June 24, 1993. The tentative settlement of $2.3 million includes remuneration to the Registrant for the value of the property taken, severance damages, if any, and reimbursement for treated water purchased from the City of Pittsburg. The amount determined as remuneration for the value of the property taken is to be applied against the value of the Registrant's Bay Point district, currently under condemnation by the Contra Costa Water District (\&quot;CCWD\&quot;).\nThe Registrant and CCWD, however, are continuing their negotiations concerning the CCWD's condemnation of the Registrant's Bay Point water district. At this time, however, the Registrant is unable to predict the final outcome of these negotiations. In 1993, water revenues from the Registrant's Bay Point water district were approximately $2.7 million or 2.75% of its total annual water revenues.\nThere are no other material pending legal proceedings, other than litigation incidental to the ordinary course of business, to which the Registrant is a party or of which any of its properties is the subject.\nItem 4.&quot;},&quot;section_4&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 4.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS - - - -------------------------------- General\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \&quot;Vishay\&quot; or the \&quot;Company\&quot;) is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of passive electronic components, particularly resistors and tantalum and film capacitors. Resistors, the most common component in electronic circuits, are used to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current. Capacitors perform energy storage, frequency control, timing and filtering functions in almost all types of electronic equipment. The Company's products are used in a broad variety of electronic applications, including those in the computer, telecommunications, military/aerospace, instrument, industrial, automotive, office equipment and entertainment industries.\nThrough a series of acquisitions over the last eight years, the Company has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and strain gages to one of the world's largest manufac- turers and suppliers of a broad line of passive electronic compo- nents. The Company's acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring manufacturers of those types of quality products in which the Company has strong marketing organizations and technical expertise but who have encountered operating, financial or management difficulties. In connection with each acquisition, the Company has implemented programs to realize synergies between its existing businesses and the acquired business. These programs have focused on reducing selling, general and administrative expenses and maximizing production efficiencies, including the integration of redundant sales offices and administrative functions and the transfer of some production operations to regions where the Company can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other incentives.\nThe Company's first major acquisition was the purchase in 1985 of a 50% interest in Dale Electronics, Inc. (\&quot;Dale\&quot;), a United States producer of precision and commercial resistors, magnetic components and plasma displays. In 1987, the Company established a major presence in Germany with the acquisition of Draloric Electronic GmbH (\&quot;Draloric\&quot;), strengthening the Company's metal film resistor and specialty resistor businesses. In 1988, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Dale as well as all of the outstanding shares of Sfernice, S.A., a French manufacturer of resistors, potentiometers and printed circuit boards. Subse- quently, Vishay acquired several small United States inductor manufacturers and one French inductor manufacturer. In 1992, the Company acquired the worldwide tantalum capacitor and United States thick film resistor network businesses of American Annuity Group, Inc., formerly Sprague Technologies, Inc. (\&quot;STI\&quot;). In January\n1993, Vishay exercised its option to purchase 81% of the outstanding share capital of Roederstein Spezialfabriken fur Bauelemente der Elektronik und Kondensatoren der Starkstromtechnik GmbH (\&quot;Roederstein\&quot;). Vishay acquired its initial 19% interest in Roederstein in February 1992. Roederstein's principal products include film, aluminum electrolytic and tantalum capacitors as well as resistors. It also manufactures single layer ceramic capacitors, heavy current capacitors and triplers.\nMost recently, on July 2, 1993, Vishay acquired the assets of the tantalum capacitor business of Philips Electronics North America Corporation, a subsidiary of Philips Electronics N.V., for approximately $11 million.\nThe Company currently operates as five separate business units: (i) Vishay Electronic Components, U.S., which is comprised of Dale, a manufacturer and supplier of resistors, the Vishay Resistive Systems Unit, which primarily manufactures high performance foil resistors and thin film resistor networks, and Sprague, which consists of the tantalum capacitor and thick film resistor network manufacturing businesses acquired from STI; (ii) Draloric/Roederstein, German-based manufacturers and suppliers of resistors and capacitors in Europe; (iii) Sfernice, S.A., a resistor producer in France; (iv) Measurements Group, Inc., which produces resistive sensors and other stress measuring devices in the United States; and (v) Vishay Components (UK) Ltd., a manufacturer and supplier of the Company's products in the United Kingdom.\nVishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lincoln Highway, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2120. The telephone number is (610) 644-1300.\nProducts\nVishay designs, manufactures and markets electronic components that cover a wide range of products and technologies. The products primarily consist of fixed resistors, tantalum and film capacitors, and, to a lesser extent, inductors, specialty ceramic capacitors, transformers, potentiometers, plasma displays and thermistors.\nResistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current. They vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured in numerous materials and forms. Resistive components may be either fixed or variable, the distinction being whether the resistance is adjustable (variable) or not (fixed). Resistors can also be used as measuring devices, such as Vishay's resistive sensors. Resistive sensors, or strain gages, are used in electronic measurement and experimental stress analysis systems, as\nwell as in transducers, for measuring loads (scales), acceleration and fluid pressure.\nFixed resistive components can be broadly categorized as discrete components or networks. A discrete component is designed to perform a single function and is incorporated by the customer in the circuitry of a system which requires that particular function. A network, on the other hand, is a microcircuit (consisting of a number of resistors placed on a ceramic base), which is designed to perform a number of standard functions. Vishay manufactures discrete resistors and networks both of which are principally sold in the precision or higher quality segments of the resistor market (i.e., fixed precision wirewound, metal film and foil resistors and network resistors).\nThe Company's resistive products primarily consist of fixed resistors (foil and thin film resistors, wire-wound resistors, metal film resistors, oxide film resistors, thermistors, thick film resistor chips, networks (microcircuits) and resistive sensors); variable resistors (trimmers and potentiometers); magnetic components (inductors and transformers) and printed circuit boards. Vishay produces resistors for virtually every segment of the resistive product market, from resistors used in the highest quality precision instruments for which the performance of the resistors is the most important requirement, to resistors for which price is the most important factor.\nCapacitors perform energy storage, frequency control, timing and filtering functions in most types of electronic equip- ment. The more important applications for capacitors are (i) electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies, (ii) decoupling and bypass of electronic signals or integrated circuits and circuit boards, and (iii) frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applica- tions. The Company's capacitor products primarily consist of solid tantalum chip capacitors, solid tantalum leaded capacitors, wet/foil tantalum capacitors and film capacitors. The tantalum capacitor is the smallest and most stable type of capacitor for its range of capacitance.\nMarkets\nThe Company's products are sold primarily to other manufacturers and, to a much lesser extent, to United States and foreign government agencies. Its products are used in, among other things, the circuitry of measuring instruments, industrial equip- ment, automotive applications including engine controls and fuel injection systems, process control systems, computer-related products, telecommunications, military and aerospace applications, medical instruments and scales.\nApproximately 41% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 1993 was attributable to sales to customers in the United States while the remainder was attributable to sales primarily in Europe. In the United States, products are marketed primarily through independent manufacturers' representatives (who are compensated solely on a commission basis), the Company's own sales personnel and independent distributors. The Company has regional sales personnel in several locations to provide technical and sales support for independent manufacturers' representatives throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. In addition, the Company uses independent distributors to resell its products. Internationally, products are sold to customers in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and other European and Pacific Rim countries through Company sales offices, independent manufacturers' representatives and distributors.\nThe Company endeavors to have its products incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the research and proto- type stages. Vishay employs its own staff of application and field engineers who work with its customers, independent manufacturers' representatives and distributors to solve technical problems and develop products to meet specific needs.\nOne of the fastest growing markets for passive electronic components is for surface mounted devices. These devices adhere to the surface of a circuit board rather than being secured by leads that pass through holes to the back side of the board. Surface mounting provides certain advantages over through-hole mounting, including the ability to place more components on a circuit board. The Company believes it has taken advantage of the growth of the surface mount market and is an industry leader in designing and marketing surface mount devices. The Company offers a wide range of these devices, including both thick and thin film resistor chips and networks, capacitors, inductors, oscillators, transformers and potentiometers, as well as a number of component packaging styles to facilitate automated product assembly by its customers.\nSales of the Company's products to manufacturers in defense-related industries have continued to decline over the past year, primarily as a result of reduced governmental procurements of defense-related products. The Company has qualified certain products under various military specifications, approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center (\&quot;DESC\&quot;), and under certain European military specifications. Classification levels have been established by DESC based upon the rate of failure of products to meet specifications (the \&quot;Classifi- cation Level\&quot;). In order to maintain the Classification Level of a product, tests must be continuously performed, and the results of these tests must be reported to DESC. If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable Classification Level, the product's classification may be reduced to a less stringent level. In that event, the Company's product may not qualify for use as a\ncomponent in other products required to meet a more stringent Classification Level, although the Company's product may still be sold for use in other products requiring a less stringent classifi- cation. After completion of additional retesting, however, the product may again be classified at its original level. Sales of the product may be adversely affected pending the completion of any such additional retesting and the resumption of the original Classification Level. Various United States manufacturing facili- ties from time to time experience a product Classification Level modification. During the time that such level is modified for any specific product, net sales and earnings derived from such product may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is undertaking to have the quality systems at all of its major manufacturing facilities approved under the established ISO 9000 international quality control standard. ISO 9000 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization. Several of the Company's manufacturing operations have already received ISO 9000 approval and others are actively pursuing such approval.\nVishay's largest customers vary from year to year, and no customer has long-term commitments to purchase products of the Company. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 1993.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company maintains separate research and development staffs and promotes separate programs at a number of its production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve product and manufacturing techniques. This decentralized system encourages individual product development and, from time to time, developments at one manufacturing facility will have applications at another facility. Most of the Company's products and manufacturing processes have been invented, designed and developed by Company engineers and scientists. Company research and development costs were approximately $7.1 million for 1993, $7.1 million for 1992 and $7.0 million for 1991. The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures. See \&quot;Competition\&quot;.\nSources of Supplies\nAlthough most materials incorporated in the Company's products are available from a number of sources, certain materials (particularly tantalum) are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In order to protect itself from manufacturing disruptions due to potential supply shortages, the Company\nmaintains a supply of certain critical materials, the nondelivery of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.\nTantalum metal is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products. Tantalum is purchased in powder form, primarily under annual contracts with domestic suppliers, at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment. The Company is a major consumer of the world's annual tantalum production. Tantalum, and other required raw materials have generally been available in sufficient quantities, but have been subject to wide price variations. Disruptions in the supply of, or substantial increases in the price of, tantalum metal could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.\nInventory and Backlog\nAlthough Vishay manufactures standardized products, a substantial portion of its products are produced to meet specific customer specifications. The Company does, however, maintain an inventory of resistors and other components. Backlog of outstand- ing orders for the Company's products was $198.4 million, $134.3 million and $104.5 million, at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The increase in backlog at December 31, 1993 and 1992, as compared with prior periods, is attributable to the acquisitions of Roederstein and Sprague, respectively. The current backlog is expected to be filled during the next 12 months. Most of the orders in the Company's backlog may be cancelled by its customers, in whole or in part, although sometimes subject to penalty. To date, however, cancellations have not represented a material portion of the backlog.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces strong competition in its various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers that produce products using technologies similar to those of the Company. Certain of the Company's products compete on the basis of its marketing and distribution network, which provides a high level of customer service, such as design assistance, order expediting and prompt delivery. In addition, the Company's competitive position depends on its product quality, know-how, proprietary data, marketing and service capabilities, business reputation and price.\nA number of the Company's customers are contractors or subcontractors on various United States and foreign government contracts. Under certain United States Government contracts, retroactive adjustments can be made to contract prices affecting the profit margin on such contracts. The Company believes that its profits are not excessive and, accordingly, no provision has been made for any such adjustment.\nIn several areas the Company strengthens its market position by conducting seminars and educational programs for customers and for potential customers.\nAlthough the Company has numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of its products and manufacturing processes, and acquired various patents with the acquisition of the STI tantalum capacitor and network lines, no particular patent is considered material to the business of the Company.\nManufacturing Operations\nThe Company conducts manufacturing operations in three principal geographic regions: the United States, Europe and Israel. At December 31, 1993, approximately 40% of the Company's identifiable assets were located in the United States, approximately 50% were located in Europe, approximately 9% were located in Israel and 1% in other regions. In the United States, the Company's main manufacturing facilities are located in Nebraska, South Dakota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Europe, the Company's main manufacturing facilities are located in Selb and Landshut, Germany and Nice and Tours, France. In Israel, manufacturing facilities are located in Holon and Dimona. The Company also maintains manufacturing facilities in Juarez, Mexico and Toronto, Canada.\nFor the year ended December 31, 1993, sales of products manufactured in Israel accounted for approximately 8% of the Company's net sales. The Company conducts manufacturing operations in Israel in order to take advantage of the relatively low wage rates in Israel and several incentive programs instituted by the Government of Israel, including certain tax abatements. These programs have contributed substantially to the growth and profitability of the Company. The Company may be materially and adversely affected if these incentive programs were no longer available to the Company or if hostilities were to occur in the Middle East that materially interfere with the Company's operations in Israel.\nDue to a shift in manufacturing emphasis, resulting from the growing market for surface mount devices, over-capacity at a number of the Company's manufacturing facilities and the relocation of some production to regions with lower labor costs, portions of the Company's work force and certain facilities may not be fully utilized in the future. As a result, the Company may incur significant costs in connection with work force reductions and the closing of additional manufacturing facilities.\nEnvironment\nThe Company's manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment. The Company is not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings which would require curtailment of its operations at this time. However, the Company is involved in various legal actions concerning state government enforcement proceedings and various dump site clean-ups. These actions may result in fines and/or clean-up expenses. The Company believes that any fine and/or clean-up expense, if imposed, would not be material. The Company continually expends funds to ensure that its facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations. The Company has nearly completed its undertaking to comply with new environmental regulations, relating to the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone depleting substances (ODS), and other anticipated compliances with the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. The Company anticipates that it will undertake capital expenditures of approximately $1,000,000 in fiscal 1994 for general environmental enhancement programs.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 1993, the Company employed approximately 14,200 full time employees of whom approximately 8,600 were located outside the United States. The Company hires few employees on a part time basis. While many of the Company's foreign employees are members of trade unions, none of the Company's employees located in the United States are represented by unions except for approximately 172 employees at the North Adams, Massachusetts facility acquired from STI, who are represented by three unions. The Company is currently negotiating the collective bargaining agreements of such domestic employees with each of these unions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is excellent.\nItem 2.&quot;},&quot;section_1A&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;section_1B&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;section_2&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 2.

Foreign leased facilities consist of 206,000 square feet in Mexico, 151,000 square feet in France, 130,000 square feet in England, 109,000 square feet in Canada and 98,000 square feet in Germany. The Company also has facilities in Japan, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic.\nIn September 1993, Vishay entered into negotiations to build an additional manufacturing facility in Israel. The facility, which will be approximately 200,000 square feet, will be located near Haifa.\nManagement believes it has sufficient manufacturing space for its current business.\nItem 3.&quot;},&quot;section_3&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 3.

The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the Company's Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape for the quarterly periods within the 1993 and 1992 fiscal years indicated. Stock prices have been restated to reflect stock dividends. The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its capital stock. Its policy is to retain earnings to support the growth of the Company's business and the Company does not intend to change this policy at the present time. In addition, the Company is restricted from paying cash dividends under the terms of the Company's revolving credit and term loan agreement (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Holders of record of the Company's Common Stock totalled approximately 1,441 at March 25, 1994.\nCOMMON STOCK MARKET PRICES\nCalendar 1993 Calendar 1992\nHigh Low High Low ------ ------ ------ ------ First Quarter $35.48 $27.38 $21.31 $14.74 Second Quarter 36.25 25.48 24.29 18.59 Third Quarter 37.75 31.63 26.67 22.03 Fourth Quarter 35.38 28.75 35.48 25.36\nOn October 1, 1990, the Company commenced a stock repur- chase program pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase up to $5 million worth of its Common Stock. The purchases of Common Stock by the Company under the repurchase program are made in open-market transactions, subject to the availability of stock in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the discretion of management. As of December 31, 1990 the Company had repurchased 36,600 shares at an approximate cost of $459,000. No repurchases were made in 1991, 1992 or 1993.\nIn addition at March 25, 1994, the Company had outstanding 3,590,232 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.10 per share (the \&quot;Class B Stock\&quot;), each of which entitles the holder to ten votes. The Class B Stock generally is not transferable and there is no market for those shares. The Class B Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Common Stock on a share for share basis.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL - - - ------- CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -------------------------------------------------\nIntroduction and Background\nThe Company's sales and net income have increased significantly in the past several years primarily as a result of its acquisitions. Following each acquisition, the Company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses. This implementation is reflected in an increase in the Company's sales and in the decline in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of the Company's sales. Since mid-1990, sales of most of the Company's products have been adversely affected by the worldwide slowdown in the electronic components industry. In addition, sales to defense-related industries have declined since the first quarter of 1991. These trends are continuing.\nYear ended December 31, 1993 compared to Year ended December 31, 1992\nResults of Operations - - - --------------------- Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased by $192,046,000 over the comparable period of the prior year. The increase resulted from the acquisition of Roederstein, effective January 1, 1993. Net sales of Roederstein were $212,124,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993. Net sales, exclusive of Roederstein, decreased by $20,078,000, compared to the same period of the prior year. This decrease in net sales is attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, which resulted in a decrease in reported Vishay sales of $15,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993, and recessionary pressures in Europe.\nCosts of products sold for the year ended December 31, 1993 were 77.5% of net sales as compared to 76.5% for the comparable period of the prior year. The reason for this increase is that the costs of products sold for Roederstein (prior to the full implementation of synergistic cost reductions) are approx- imately 80% of net sales, while Vishay's business, exclusive of Roederstein, has been operating in the 76% to 78% range. In 1993, grants of $3,424,000 received from the government of Israel, which were utilized to offset start-up costs of new facilities, were recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1993 were 13.9% of net sales as compared to 15.3% for the comparable period of the prior year. The current year's lower rates reflect the effect of the acquisition of\nRoederstein and the ongoing cost savings programs implemented with the acquisition of certain businesses of STI during 1992.\nRestructuring charges of $6,659,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 consist primarily of severance costs related to the Company's decision to downsize its European operations, primarily in France, as a result of the European business climate.\nIncome from unusual items of $7,221,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 represents proceeds received for business interruption insurance claims principally related to operations in Dimona, Israel.\nInterest costs increased by $1,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 as a result of increased debt incurred for the acquisition of Roederstein.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 1993 decreased by $4,410,000 over the comparable period of the prior year because other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 included consulting fees of $2,307,000 from Roederstein. These fees to Vishay were for time and expenses of Vishay personnel utilized by Roederstein in its attempt to restructure itself. Also, other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 included fees of approximately $3,325,000 from STI under one-year sales and distribution agreements. Foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $1,382,000, as compared to foreign currency losses of $1,594,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992.\nThe effective tax rate of 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 1993 reflects the non-taxability of certain insurance recoveries. The 1993 rate was also affected by increased manufacturing in Israel, where the Company's average income tax rate was approximately 4% in 1993. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1993, exclusive of the effect of the non- taxable insurance proceeds, was 18.6%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1992 was 19.8%.\nAccounting Changes - - - ------------------ Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, \&quot;Accounting for Income Taxes\&quot;. The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase net income by $1,427,000. Application of the new income tax rules also decreased pretax earnings by $2,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 because of increased depreciation expense as a result of Statement 109's requirement to report assets acquired in prior business combinations at their pretax amounts.\nThe Company also adopted FASB Statement No. 106, \&quot;Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\&quot;, effective January 1, 1993. The Company has elected to recognize the transition obligation on a prospective basis over a twenty-year period. In 1993, the new standard resulted in additional annual net periodic postretirement benefit costs of $1,200,000 before taxes, and $792,000 after taxes, or $0.04 per share. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to apply the new standard.\nYear ended December 31, 1992 compared to Year ended December 31, 1991\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 1992 increased $221,943,000 over the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was the result of the inclusion of the businesses acquired from STI effective as of January 1, 1992. Net sales of the acquired businesses were $230,492,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992. For the year ended December 31, 1992, net sales, exclusive of the acquired businesses, decreased by $8,549,000 compared to the same period of the prior year when recessionary pressures affecting sales were not as great.\nThe weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies resulted in an increase in reported Vishay sales of $10,418,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992.\nCosts of products sold for the year ended December 31, 1992 were 76.5% of net sales as compared to 71.9% for the comparable period of the prior year. The reason for this increase is that the costs of products sold for the newly purchased businesses from STI (prior to any synergistic cost reductions) are 80% of net sales, while Vishay's resistor businesses traditionally operate at levels of 70% to 75%.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1992 were 15.3% of net sales compared to 17.2% for the comparable period of the prior year. The 15.3% rate reflects the effect of the businesses acquired from STI. The rate applicable to the businesses acquired from STI (approximately 11%) includes the effects of initial cost saving programs installed subsequent to the acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 1992, selling, general and administrative expenses of the Vishay resistor business (approximately 17%) were comparable to the levels experienced in the prior year.\nInterest costs increased by $3,903,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992 as a result of the increased debt incurred for the purchase of the businesses from STI.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 1992 includes consulting fees of $2,307,000 from Roederstein. Other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 also includes fees of approxi-\nmately $3,325,000 from STI under one-year sales and distribution agreements expiring February 14, 1993, which were entered into in connection with the acquisition of the businesses from STI.\nThe effective tax rate was 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 1992. The effective rate is comparable to the rate of 23.3% for 1991. The 1992 rate was in part affected by increased manufacturing in Israel where the Company's average income tax rate was 7% for 1992.\nYear ended December 31, 1991 compared to Year ended December 31, 1990\nNet sales decreased by $3,313,000 or approximately 1% to $442,283,000 for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $445,596,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990. Sales increased in the United States by 2.7% as a result of acquisitions, which partially offset the effect of the worldwide recession. Sales in Western Europe declined 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 1990 as a result of the recession and the strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies. Price increases did not materially affect sales.\nCosts of products sold increased to $318,166,000 or 71.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $312,925,000 or 70.2% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1990. The increase in costs of products sold as a percentage of sales reflects increased production costs of relatively flat sales in addition to certain manufacturing inefficiencies during the latter part of 1991.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $75,973,000 or 17.2% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $77,740,000 or 17.4% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1990 primarily because of the continuation of cost reduction programs introduced during 1990.\nExpenses of approximately $3,700,000 for layoff costs at the Company's European subsidiaries were incurred during the latter half of 1991. This correction to the work force was made to strengthen the subsidiaries' ability to attain earnings goals and to respond to the current recession.\nInterest expense decreased by $4,219,000 to $15,207,000 for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $19,426,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990 primarily as a result of payments made on long-term debt and lower interest rates.\nOther expenses for the year ended December 31, 1991 were $289,000 compared to income of $2,344,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990, primarily due to decreases in investment grants from Israel and interest income. Investment grants and interest\nincome for the year ended December 31, 1991 were $106,000 and $797,000, respectively, compared to $980,000 and $2,257,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1990.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1991 was 23.3% versus 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 1990. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a reduced tax rate for certain Israeli operations and an increase in the propor- tion of earnings taxable in Israel. The lower rate was primarily due to tax advantages of doing business in Israel where the Company's effective average tax rate was approximately 10% at that time.\nFinancial Condition\nCash flows from operations were $50,114,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to $54,357,000 for the prior year and were used primarily to finance capital expenditures. Purchases of property and equipment were $76,813,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to $49,801,000 for the prior year primarily due to additions of manufacturing equipment for surface mount products and expansion of manufacturing facilities in Israel. The Company's financial condition at December 31, 1993 is strong with the Company's current ratio of 2.1 to 1. The Company's ratio of long-term debt to stockholders' equity was .7 to 1 at December 31, 1993 as compared to .4 to 1 at December 31, 1992. The increase in this ratio resulted from additional borrowings in connection with the acquisition of Roederstein.\nIn connection with the Roederstein acquisition, Vishay entered into a DM 104,316,000 term loan agreement with its lending banks in January 1993. In addition, an Israeli subsidiary of Vishay borrowed $20 million pursuant to an unsecured credit agreement. The funds from the credit facilities were used in connection with the Roederstein acquisition and the refinancing of Roederstein's debt. Vishay and the Banks also amended certain terms of the outstanding $170,000,000 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 10, 1992 among Vishay and the Banks and the Amended and Restated DM 42,375,000 Revolving Credit and DM 57,036,000 Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 10, 1992 among Vishay, Draloric and the lending banks in order to, among other things, allow Vishay to draw upon its revolving credit facilities to refinance a portion of Roederstein's debt.\nSee Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere herein for additional information with respect to Vishay's loan agreements, long-term debt and available short- term credit lines.\nManagement believes that available sources of credit, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's anticipated financing needs\nfor working capital and capital expenditures during the next twelve months.\nInflation\nNormally, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations. The Company's products are not generally sold on long-term contracts. Consequently, selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, can be adjusted to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.\nItem 8.&quot;},&quot;section_7A&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;section_8&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Item 8.

Subsidiaries of the Registrant.\n23. Consent of Independent Auditors.\nReport of Independent Auditors\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nAs discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 1993 the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes (Note 5) and postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 10).\n/s/ ERNST &amp; YOUNG\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 10, 1994 except for Note 6, as to which the date is March 25, 1994\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nDecember 31 1993 1992 -------------------------- Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,931 $ 15,977 Accounts receivable, less allowances of $5,150 and $3,885 125,284 102,757 Inventories: Finished goods 85,783 50,874 Raw materials and work in process 138,872 99,901 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 33,365 18,192 -------------------------- Total current assets 394,235 287,701\nProperty and equipment--at cost: Land 33,791 12,917 Buildings and improvements 136,432 87,623 Machinery and equipment 398,885 288,527 -------------------------- 569,108 389,067 Less allowances for depreciation (149,004) (117,448) -------------------------- 420,104 271,619\nGoodwill 118,286 74,872\nOther assets 15,481 27,451 -------------------------- $948,106 $661,643 ==========================\nDecember 31 1993 1992 -------------------------- Liabilities and stockholders' equity Current liabilities: Notes payable to banks $ 22,695 $ 18,966 Trade accounts payable 48,404 42,727 Payroll and related expenses 28,942 23,124 Other accrued expenses 54,112 25,984 Income taxes 3,740 - Current portion of long-term debt 30,536 31,573 -------------------------- Total current liabilities 188,429 142,374\nLong-term debt--less current portion 266,999 139,540 Deferred income taxes 26,080 9,786 Other liabilities 24,081 1,021 Accrued pension costs 66,014 22,297\nStockholders' equity: Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 a share: Authorized--1,000,000 shares; none issued Common Stock, par value $.10 a share: Authorized--35,000,000 shares; 17,639,081 and 16,795,234 shares outstanding after deducting 47,441 and 47,432 shares in treasury 1,763 1,679 Class B convertible Common Stock, par value $.10 a share: Authorized-- 15,000,000 shares; 3,590,232 and 3,419,385 shares outstanding after deducting 125,965 and 119,967 shares in treasury 359 342 Capital in excess of par value 288,980 253,446 Retained earnings 105,849 97,156 Foreign currency translation adjustment (13,109) (5,864) Unearned compensation (60) (134) Pension adjustment (7,279) - -------------------------- 376,503 346,625 -------------------------- $948,106 $661,643 ==========================\nSee accompanying notes.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nYear ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 ------------------------------------------ Net sales $856,272 $664,226 $442,283 Costs of products sold 663,239 508,018 318,166 ------------------------------------------ Gross profit 193,033 156,208 124,117\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 118,906 101,327 75,973 Restructuring expense 6,659 - 3,700 Unusual items (7,221) - - ------------------------------------------ 74,689 54,881 44,444\nOther income (expense): Interest expense (20,624) (19,110) (15,207) Amortization of goodwill (3,294) (2,380) (1,695) Other 123 4,533 (289) ------------------------------------------ (23,795) (16,957) (17,191) ------------------------------------------ Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 50,894 37,924 27,253 Income taxes 8,246 7,511 6,363 ------------------------------------------ Earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 42,648 30,413 20,890 Cumulative effect of accounting change for income taxes 1,427 - - ------------------------------------------ Net earnings $44,075 $30,413 $20,890 ========================================== Earnings per share: Before cumulative effect of accounting change $2.01 $1.71 $1.25 Accounting change for income taxes 0.07 - - ------------------------------------------ Net earnings $2.08 $1.71 $1.25 ========================================== Weighted average shares outstanding 21,228,000 19,366,000 16,649,000 ========================================== See accompanying notes.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 1993\n1.

Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was $43,493,000, $30,995,000, and $23,706,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Accumulated amortization amounted to $10,945,000 and $7,679,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.\nCash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe amount charged to expense aggregated $7,097,000, $7,149,000, and $6,967,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.\nGrants\nGrants received from governments by certain foreign subsidiaries are recognized as income when conditions for receipt are met. In 1993, grants of $3,424,000 received from the government of Israel, which were utilized to offset startup costs of new facilities, were recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares (from the assumed conversion of convertible subordinated debentures) outstanding during the period. In October 1992, the convertible subordinated debentures were converted into 2,536,783 shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 1992, where assumed conversion of the debentures has a dilutive effect, net earnings used in the computations are adjusted for interest expense, net of income taxes, on the convertible subordinated debentures. Earnings per share amounts for all periods presented reflect 5% stock dividends paid on June 11, 1993, June 16, 1992, and June 11, 1991. Earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 reflect the weighted effect of the issuance of 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock on December 24, 1992.\nAccounting Changes\nIn 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes (Note 5) and postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 10).\nReclassifications\nCertain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.\n2. Acquisitions\nDuring January 1993, Vishay exercised its option to purchase the remaining 81% of the outstanding share capital of Roederstein GmbH, a passive electronic components manufacturer with headquarters in Germany for 4,050,000 Deutsche Marks (\&quot;DM\&quot;) ($2,502,000) pursuant to an option agreement dated February 18, 1992. Vishay had acquired its initial 19% interest in Roederstein on February 18, 1992 for DM 950,000 ($577,000). In connection with the acquisition, Vishay refinanced all of Roederstein's existing bank debt of DM 160,381,000 ($99,062,000). Funds to refinance Roederstein's debt were provided by a DM 104,316,000 term loan with a group of banks, $20,000,000 borrowed under an unsecured credit agreement, and borrowings under an existing line of credit.\nEffective January 1, 1992, the Company acquired the worldwide tantalum capacitor and U.S. thick film resistor network businesses of Sprague Technologies, Inc. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Vishay paid $127,000,000 cash, transferred to Sprague real property with a fair value of $4,771,000, and assumed certain liabilities relating to the businesses. Vishay also entered into certain ancillary agreements with the seller, including one-year sales and distribution agreements under which Vishay received fees of $3,325,000 during 1992, which are included in other income. The purchase price was funded primarily from a $125,000,000 term loan facility.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n2. Acquisitions (continued)\nThe acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The operating results of Roederstein and Sprague have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations from January 1, 1993 and January 1, 1992, respectively. Excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (Roederstein--$45,210,000; Sprague--$19,534,000) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.\nHad the Roederstein and Sprague acquisitions been made at the beginning of the year prior to their acquisition, the Company's pro forma unaudited results would have been (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31 1992 1991 ------------------------- Net sales $913,398 $679,183 Net earnings (loss) (22,992) 20,591 Earnings (loss) per share $(1.19) $1.24\nThe unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or of results which may occur in the future. Pro forma net earnings for 1992 reflect $31,860,000 of restructuring costs incurred by Roederstein for work force reductions.\nDuring 1992, Vishay provided Roederstein with management and sales support, short-term working capital advances, and assistance in renegotiating Roederstein's bank debt. Vishay also assisted Roederstein in developing a cost-savings program involving reductions in the Roederstein work force, including the closing of an unprofitable division. Vishay recognized consulting fees, which are included in other income, from Roederstein of $2,307,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992 for its assistance to Roederstein. As of December 31, 1992, Vishay had investments in Roederstein of $3,229,000, advances to Roederstein, included in other assets, of $16,918,000, accounts receivable and other current receivables from Roederstein of $5,166,000, and accounts payable to Roederstein of $1,158,000.\nThe Company made several minor acquisitions in 1993 and 1991, all of which were accounted for under the purchase method. The results of operations of these businesses have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from the dates of acquisition.\n3. Restructuring Expense and Unusual Items\nRestructuring expenses of $6,659,000 for 1993 related to the downsizing of some of the Company's European operations. Income from unusual items of $7,221,000 for 1993 represents insurance recoveries the Company has received for business interruption insurance claims.\nThe Company incurred restructuring costs of $3,700,000 in 1991 relating primarily to costs associated with layoffs in France.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n4. Foreign Subsidiaries\nThe following amounts relating to foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands):\n5. Income Taxes\nEffective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, \&quot;Accounting for Income Taxes.\&quot; As permitted under the new rules, prior years' financial statements have not been restated.\nThe cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase net earnings by $1,427,000, or $.07 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1993, application of the new income tax rules decreased pretax income by $2,870,000 because of increased depreciation expense as a result of Statement 109's requirement to report assets acquired in prior business combinations at their pretax amounts.\nAt December 31, 1993, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $96,300,000 in Germany (no expiration date), $3,100,000 in France (expire December 31, 1998), and $1,800,000 in Portugal (expire December 31, 1997). Approximately $70,800,000 of the carryforward in Germany, and the full $1,800,000 in Portugal, resulted from the Company's acquisition of Roederstein. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance of $34,862,000 has been recognized to offset deferred tax assets related to German net operating loss carryforwards. If tax benefits are recognized in the future through reductions of the valuation allowance, such amounts will reduce goodwill of acquired companies. The valuation allowance decreased from January 1, 1993 by $6,584,000 primarily due to a decrease in German tax rates which had the effect of reducing the deferred tax asset for German net operating loss carryforwards.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n5. Income Taxes (continued)\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):\nDeferred tax liabilities: Tax over book depreciation $57,401 Other--net 2,685 --------- Total deferred tax liabilities 60,086 --------- Deferred tax assets: Pension and other retiree obligations 20,179 Net operating loss carryforwards 38,773 Restructuring reserves 7,354 Other accruals and reserves 12,300 --------- Total deferred tax assets 78,606 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (34,862) --------- Net deferred tax assets 43,744 --------- Net deferred tax liabilities $16,342 ========= For financial reporting purposes, earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change includes the following components (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 ---------------------------------- Pretax income: Domestic $13,136 $10,252 $8,519 Foreign 37,758 27,672 18,734 ---------------------------------- $50,894 $37,924 $27,253 ==================================\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n5.

These amounts were partially offset by differences relating to inventory valuation methods ($900,000) and other items ($757,000). For the year ended December 31, 1991, deferred taxes resulted principally from use of accelerated methods of depreciation for tax purposes.\nA reconciliation of income tax at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax expense is as follows (in thousands):\nLiability Method Deferred Method -------------------------------- Year ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 -------------------------------- Tax at statutory rate $17,304 $12,894 $9,266 State income taxes, net of federal tax 396 501 452 Effect of foreign income tax rates (10,532) (5,649) (5,166) Effect of purchase accounting adjustments 717 939 1,291 Other 361 (1,174) 520 -------------------------------- $8,246 $7,511 $6,363 ================================\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n5.

Postretirement Medical Benefits\nThe Company pays limited health care premiums for certain eligible retired U.S. employees. Prior to 1993, the cost of these benefits, which was not significant, was charged to expense when the benefits were paid.\nEffective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 106, \&quot;Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.\&quot; Under this new standard, the Company recognizes the cost of postretirement benefits over the active service period of its employees. The Company elected to recognize the transition obligation, which represents the previously unrecognized prior service cost, on a prospective basis over a twenty-year period. In 1993, the new standard resulted in additional annual net periodic postretirement benefit cost of $1,200,000 before taxes and $792,000 after taxes, or $0.04 per share. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to apply the new standard.\nNet postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1993 included the following components (in thousands):\nService cost $ 351 Interest cost 713 Net amortization and deferral 424 ------- Net postretirement benefit cost $ 1,488 =======\nThe cost information does not include the effects of Plan amendments made at the end of 1993, which are expected to reduce future costs. Cash payments for these benefits were $288,000 for 1993. The Company continues to fund postretirement medical benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nThe status of the plan and amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation: Retirees $(2,234) Actives eligible to retire (956) Other actives (3,028) ------------ Total (6,218) Unrecognized loss 955 Unrecognized transition obligation 4,063 ------------ Accrued postretirement benefit liability $(1,200) ============ The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reflects Plan amendments made at the end of 1993 which capped employer contributions for each participant at the 1993 dollar amounts. The discount rate used in the calculation was 7.5%.\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n11. Leases\nTotal rental expense under operating leases was $7,528,000, $9,577,000, and $4,435,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.\nFuture minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: 1994-- $5,694,000; 1995--$4,226,000; 1996--$3,582,000; 1997--$2,947,000; 1998-- $2,602,000; thereafter--$7,492,000\n12. Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk. The amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and for short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value.\n13.

General
Southern California Water Company (the "Registrant") is a public utility company engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water. The Registrant also distributes electricity in one community. The Registrant, regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC"), was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of California as American States Water Services Company of California as the result of the consolidation of 20 water utility companies. From time to time additional water companies and municipal water districts have been acquired and properties in limited service areas have been sold. The Registrant's present name was adopted in 1936.
At December 31, 1993, the Registrant provided service in 17 separate operating districts, 16 of which were water districts and one an electric district, located in 75 communities in ten counties throughout the State of California. Total population of the service areas on December 31, 1993 was approximately 1,000,000. As of that date, about 73% of the Registrant's water customers were located in the greater metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. The Registrant provided electric service to the City of Big Bear Lake and surrounding areas in San Bernardino County. All electric energy sold is purchased from Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") on a resale rate schedule.
The Registrant served 236,985 water customers and 20,131 electric customers at December 31, 1993, or a total of 257,116 customers compared with 255,966 total customers at December 31, 1992. For the year ended December 31, 1993, approximately 90% of the Registrant's operating revenues were derived from water sales and approximately 10% from the sale of electricity, ratios which are generally consistent with prior years. Operating income before taxes on income of the electric district was 9.2% of the Registrant's total operating income before taxes. The material contained in Note 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders provides additional information on business segments while Note 13 provides information regarding the seasonal nature of the Registrant's business. Page 15 of the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders lists the geographical distribution of customers.
During 1993, the Registrant supplied, from all sources, a total of 178,196 acre feet of water compared with 172,500 acre feet for the previous year. Of the total water supplied in 1993, approximately 43% was purchased from others, principally from member agencies of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("MWD"), and 1% was furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation under contract, at no cost, for the Registrant's Arden-Cordova District and to the Registrant's Clearlake district by prescriptive right to water extracted from Clear Lake. These amounts reflect a continued reduction in reliance on imported water supplies.
The MWD is a water district organized under the laws of the State of California for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas within its jurisdiction which includes most of coastal Southern California from the County of Ventura south to and including San Diego County. The Registrant has 52 connections to the water distribution facilities of MWD and other municipal water agencies. MWD imports water from two principal sources: the Colorado River and the State Water Project ("SWP"). Available water supplies from the Colorado River and the SWP have historically been sufficient to meet most of MWD's requirements even though the State's major reservoirs were significantly impacted by six years of drought. The drought officially ended in February, 1993. The price of water purchased from MWD, however, is expected to continue to increase. MWD announced a 7% rate adjustment on March 8, 1994, effective for the 1994-1995 fiscal year.
In those districts of the Registrant which pump groundwater, overall groundwater conditions continue to maintain at adequate levels. The Registrant drilled six new wells during 1993 in order to improve the Registrant's ability to use more groundwater in its resource mix and further decrease its dependence on purchased water.
The Registrant is continuing its efforts to become a participant in the Coastal Aqueduct extension of the State Water Project (the "Project"). The Registrant believes that participation in the Project is necessary in order to provide another source of water for its Santa Maria water district. Should the Registrant be allowed to participate in the Project at a 500 acre-foot level, the Registrant will prepare a filing with the CPUC in order to recover costs associated with that participation under normal rate-making methods. A final decision of the CPUC on the application would not be anticipated until late 1994 or early 1995.
Rates and Regulation
The Registrant is subject to regulation by the CPUC as to its water and electric business and properties. The CPUC has broad powers of regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities, rates, classifications of accounts, valuation of properties and the purchase, disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service. It also has authority over the issuance of securities, the granting of certificates of convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters.
Water rates of the Registrant vary from district to district due to differences in operating conditions and costs. Each operating district is considered a separate entity for rate-making purposes. The Registrant continuously monitors its operations in all of its districts so that applications for rate changes may be filed, when warranted, on a district-by-district basis in accordance with CPUC procedure. Under the CPUC's practices, rates may be increased by three methods - general rate increases, offsets for certain expense increases and advice letter filings related to certain plant additions. General rate increases typically are for three year periods and include "step" increases in rates for the second and third years.
General rate increases are established by formal proceedings in which the overall rate structure, expenses and rate base of the district are examined. Rates are based on estimated expenses and capital costs for a forward two-year period. A major feature of the proceeding is the use of an attrition mechanism for setting rates for the third of the three year test cycle assuming that the costs and expenses will increase in the same proportion over the second year as the increase projected for the second test year increased over the first test year. The step rate increases for the second and third years are allowed to compensate for the projected cost increases, but are subject to tests including a demonstration that earnings levels in the district did not exceed the latest rate of return authorized for the Registrant. Formal general rate proceedings typically take about twelve months from the filing of a Notice of Intent to increase rates to the authorization of new rates.
Rate increases to offset increases in certain expenses such as costs of purchased water, energy costs to pump water, costs of power purchased for resale and groundwater production assessments are accomplished through an abbreviated "offset" procedure that typically takes about two months. CPUC regulations require utilities to maintain balancing accounts which reflect differences between specific offset cost increases and the rate increases authorized to offset those costs. The balancing accounts are subject to amortization through the offset procedure or through general rate decisions.
An advice letter, or rate base offset, proceeding is generally undertaken on an order of the CPUC in a general rate proceeding wherein the inclusion of certain projected plant facilities in future rates is delayed pending notification that such facilities have actually been placed in service. The advice letter provides such notification and, after CPUC approval, permits the Registrant to include the costs associated with the facilities in rates.
During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Registrant's rates for all water districts were increased, among other reasons, to directly offset increases in certain expenses, principally purchased water, as well as increased levels of capital improvements. The Registrant decreased rates in its Bear Valley electric district by approximately 28% in November, 1991 as a result of amortizing large refunds from the Registrant's wholesale power supplier. The following table lists information related to the Registrant's rate increases for the last three years:
The Registrant filed an application for general rate increases in six of its water operating districts in May, 1992. In June, 1993, the CPUC issued its decision and the Registrant requested rehearing on two matters - the rate of return on rate base and an authorized rate increase for the Registrant's Bay Point water district. The CPUC granted the Registrant's request for rehearing on the two issues and established an interim rate of return on rate base of 9.5% applicable for certain attrition, step rate filings and other earnings test filings with respect to the Registrant's other operating districts. For further information, please see the caption "Rates and Regulation" under Management's Discussion and Analysis herein and Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.
The Registrant has filed its case on the two matters set for rehearing, which was held on March 15, 1994. Prior to commencement of hearings, the Registrant and the Division of Ratepayer Advocates ("DRA") of the CPUC had stipulated to a rate of return on common equity of 10.10%. In addition, DRA had agreed that an increase in rates applicable to the Registrant's Bay Point water district was appropriate with certain modifications as to the level of rate base. A final decision on these matters, however, is still subject to the CPUC and is not expected until the Summer of 1994.
The Registrant anticipates filing applications with the CPUC in July, 1994 for rate increases, effective in 1995, in all of its operating districts for certain cost-effective recommendations resulting from the recently completed Management Audit of the Registrant conducted under the auspices of the CPUC. In addition, the Registrant will file a general rate case in one of its water operating districts. The requested annual increase in rates will also seek step increases for 1996 and 1997. No assurance can be given that the CPUC will authorize any or all of the rates for which the Registrant applies.
Industrial Relations
The Registrant had 486 paid employees as of December 31, 1993. Seventeen employees in the Bear Valley Electric District were members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Their present labor agreement is effective through June 30, 1994. Seventy-three of the Registrant's water utility employees, unionized under the Utility Workers of America ("UWA"), are covered by a contract which expires March 31, 1996. The Registrant has no other unionized employees.
Environmental Matters
The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), under provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, is required to establish Maximum Contaminant Levels ("MCL's") for the 83 potential drinking water contaminants initially listed in the Act, and for an additional 25 contaminants every three years thereafter. The California Department of Health Services ("DOHS"), acting on behalf of the EPA, administers the EPA's program.
The Registrant continues to test its wells and water systems for more than 90 contaminants. Water from wells found to contain levels of contaminants above the established MCL's has either been treated or blended before it is delivered to customers. Only 2 of the Registrant's 306 wells have been permanently taken out of service due to high levels of contamination.
The Registrant is aware of two new rules pending implementation by the EPA which may significantly affect the Registrant: the Radon Rule and the Arsenic Rule. The EPA did not meet the October 1, 1993 deadline for establishing an MCL for radon. Because of this inaction, the rule is presently in the hands of the United States Congress where it is believed that an MCL will be established primarily to implement the regulation. However, the 1994 budget as drafted by the Appropriations Committee has specifically excluded funds for further work on radon regulation, basically setting a moratorium on the regulation. The EPA is continuing its review of data on the Arsenic Rule although the Registrant anticipates an MCL will be proposed by September, 1994. The Registrant is unable to predict, until the MCL's are established, what effects, if any, these new rules will have on its financial condition or results of operation.
The Registrant has experienced increased operating costs for testing to determine the levels (if any) of the contaminants in the Registrant's source of supply and costs to lower the level of any contaminants found to a level that meets standards. Such costs and the control of any other pollutants may include capital costs as well as increased operating costs. The rate-making process provides the Registrant with the opportunity to recover capital and operating costs associated with water quality, and management believes that such costs are properly recoverable.

Franchises, Competition, Acquisitions and Condemnation of Properties
The Registrant holds the required franchises from the incorporated communities and the counties which it serves. The Registrant holds certificates of public convenience and necessity granted by the CPUC in each of the 17 districts it serves.
The business of the Registrant is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies. The Registrant's certificates, franchises and similar rights are subject to alteration, suspension or repeal by the respective governmental authorities having jurisdiction over such matters.
The laws of the State of California provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, also known as condemnation. The Registrant has been, within the last three years, involved in activities related to the condemnation of its Big Bear and Bay Point water districts. The Registrant continues to oppose the condemnation actions with respect to its Bay Point water district initiated by the Contra Costa Water District in 1992. Note 8 of the Notes to Financial Statements contained in the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders herein describes condemnation actions related to the Registrant's properties in greater detail.
Water Properties
As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant's physical properties consisted of water transmission and distribution systems which included over 2,560 miles of pipeline together with services, meters and fire hydrants and approximately 438 parcels of land (generally less than 1 acre each) on which are located wells, pumping plants, reservoirs and other utility facilities. The Registrant's operating properties have been maintained and improved in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant owned and operated 306 wells equipped with pumps with an aggregate capacity of 265.7 million gallons per day ("MGD"). Other production facilities include filter plants with an aggregate capacity of 29.4 MGD and 52 connections to the water distribution facilities of the MWD and other municipal water agencies. The Registrant's storage reservoirs and tanks have an aggregate capacity of 156.6 million gallons. There are no dams in the Registrant's system.
Electric Properties
The Registrant's electric properties are all located in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant operated 28.8 miles of overhead 34.5 KV transmission lines, 0.6 miles of underground 34.5 KV transmission lines, 172.7 miles of 4.16 KV or 2.4 KV distribution lines, 41.7 miles of underground cable and 14 sub-stations. There are no generating plants in the Registrant's system.
Other Properties
The Registrant's general offices are housed in a single-story office building located in San Dimas, California. The land and the building, which was completed and occupied in early 1990, are owned by the Registrant. Certain of the Registrant's district offices are housed in leased premises.
During 1993, the Registrant refinanced a significant portion of its then outstanding debt in order to lower interest costs. In doing so, the Registrant redeemed all outstanding First Mortgage Bonds. In early 1994, the Trustee filed for release of the lien of an indenture securing the previously outstanding First Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 1993, the Registrant had no mortgage debt outstanding.
Financing of Construction Expenditures
The Registrant's construction program is designed to ensure its customers with high quality service. The Registrant has an ongoing distribution main replacement program, throughout its service areas, based upon the priority of leaks detected, fire protection enhancement and a reflection of the underlying replacement schedule. In addition, the Registrant upgrades its electric and water supply facilities and is aggressively scheduling meter replacements. The Registrant anticipates gross capital expenditures of $26,700,000, $17,500,000 and $34,500,000 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
During 1993, the Registrant issued 1,107,000 Common Shares (on a post-split basis) in two separate public offerings for aggregate net proceeds of $23,935,000. The net proceeds were applied against then outstanding short-term bank borrowing incurred to temporarily finance construction expenditures.
The Registrant issued additional common equity through its Dividend Reinvestment and Common Share Purchase Plan and its 401-k Plan. The Registrant issued 47,828, 28,416 and 29,146 shares under the Dividend Reinvestment and Common Share Purchase Plan in the three years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The Registrant issued 7,741 and 7,102 Common Shares under the 401-k Plan in the two years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992. The Registrant did not issue any Common Shares through its 401-k Plan in the year ended December 31, 1991.
During 1993 and 1992, the Registrant did not undertake any long-term debt financing to provide additional funds for construction. In 1993, however, the Registrant did refinance $37 million of its long-term debt, in order to reduce interest expense, through its Medium Term Note Program. In 1992, the Registrant entered into a $2,247,000 fixed rate obligation due 2013 for financing construction of a new reservoir serving one of the Registrant's water operating districts.
In May, 1991, the Registrant completed the sale of $28,000,000 in long-term Notes Due 2031, $13,500,000 of which was used to repay then outstanding short-term bank loans which had been used to fund the Registrant's construction program. In addition, in December, 1991, the Registrant redeemed, at a premium, $6,000,000 principal amount of 11-3/4% Notes. The remainder of the proceeds from the May, 1991 issue was utilized to fund the Registrant's capital expansion program.

On October 20, 1993, the Registrant and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") reached a tentative settlement on the results of the IRS examination of the Registrant's 1987, 1988 and 1989 tax returns. Based on the settlement, the Registrant remitted an additional $438,000 in taxes. The Registrant anticipates signing the final agreement in late March, 1994.
On March 8, 1994, the Registrant and the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors (the "County") reached a tentative settlement of issues related to the County's taking on the Registrant's Madison Treatment plant in its Bay Point water district. The County's Highway Department had taken possession of the property on June 24, 1993. The tentative settlement of $2.3 million includes remuneration to the Registrant for the value of the property taken, severance damages, if any, and reimbursement for treated water purchased from the City of Pittsburg. The amount determined as remuneration for the value of the property taken is to be applied against the value of the Registrant's Bay Point district, currently under condemnation by the Contra Costa Water District ("CCWD").
The Registrant and CCWD, however, are continuing their negotiations concerning the CCWD's condemnation of the Registrant's Bay Point water district. At this time, however, the Registrant is unable to predict the final outcome of these negotiations. In 1993, water revenues from the Registrant's Bay Point water district were approximately $2.7 million or 2.75% of its total annual water revenues.
There are no other material pending legal proceedings, other than litigation incidental to the ordinary course of business, to which the Registrant is a party or of which any of its properties is the subject.

Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Vishay" or the "Company") is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of passive electronic components, particularly resistors and tantalum and film capacitors. Resistors, the most common component in electronic circuits, are used to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current. Capacitors perform energy storage, frequency control, timing and filtering functions in almost all types of electronic equipment. The Company's products are used in a broad variety of electronic applications, including those in the computer, telecommunications, military/aerospace, instrument, industrial, automotive, office equipment and entertainment industries.
Through a series of acquisitions over the last eight years, the Company has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and strain gages to one of the world's largest manufac- turers and suppliers of a broad line of passive electronic compo- nents. The Company's acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring manufacturers of those types of quality products in which the Company has strong marketing organizations and technical expertise but who have encountered operating, financial or management difficulties. In connection with each acquisition, the Company has implemented programs to realize synergies between its existing businesses and the acquired business. These programs have focused on reducing selling, general and administrative expenses and maximizing production efficiencies, including the integration of redundant sales offices and administrative functions and the transfer of some production operations to regions where the Company can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other incentives.
The Company's first major acquisition was the purchase in 1985 of a 50% interest in Dale Electronics, Inc. ("Dale"), a United States producer of precision and commercial resistors, magnetic components and plasma displays. In 1987, the Company established a major presence in Germany with the acquisition of Draloric Electronic GmbH ("Draloric"), strengthening the Company's metal film resistor and specialty resistor businesses. In 1988, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Dale as well as all of the outstanding shares of Sfernice, S.A., a French manufacturer of resistors, potentiometers and printed circuit boards. Subse- quently, Vishay acquired several small United States inductor manufacturers and one French inductor manufacturer. In 1992, the Company acquired the worldwide tantalum capacitor and United States thick film resistor network businesses of American Annuity Group, Inc., formerly Sprague Technologies, Inc. ("STI"). In January
1993, Vishay exercised its option to purchase 81% of the outstanding share capital of Roederstein Spezialfabriken fur Bauelemente der Elektronik und Kondensatoren der Starkstromtechnik GmbH ("Roederstein"). Vishay acquired its initial 19% interest in Roederstein in February 1992. Roederstein's principal products include film, aluminum electrolytic and tantalum capacitors as well as resistors. It also manufactures single layer ceramic capacitors, heavy current capacitors and triplers.
Most recently, on July 2, 1993, Vishay acquired the assets of the tantalum capacitor business of Philips Electronics North America Corporation, a subsidiary of Philips Electronics N.V., for approximately $11 million.
The Company currently operates as five separate business units: (i) Vishay Electronic Components, U.S., which is comprised of Dale, a manufacturer and supplier of resistors, the Vishay Resistive Systems Unit, which primarily manufactures high performance foil resistors and thin film resistor networks, and Sprague, which consists of the tantalum capacitor and thick film resistor network manufacturing businesses acquired from STI; (ii) Draloric/Roederstein, German-based manufacturers and suppliers of resistors and capacitors in Europe; (iii) Sfernice, S.A., a resistor producer in France; (iv) Measurements Group, Inc., which produces resistive sensors and other stress measuring devices in the United States; and (v) Vishay Components (UK) Ltd., a manufacturer and supplier of the Company's products in the United Kingdom.
Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lincoln Highway, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2120. The telephone number is (610) 644-1300.
Products
Vishay designs, manufactures and markets electronic components that cover a wide range of products and technologies. The products primarily consist of fixed resistors, tantalum and film capacitors, and, to a lesser extent, inductors, specialty ceramic capacitors, transformers, potentiometers, plasma displays and thermistors.
Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current. They vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured in numerous materials and forms. Resistive components may be either fixed or variable, the distinction being whether the resistance is adjustable (variable) or not (fixed). Resistors can also be used as measuring devices, such as Vishay's resistive sensors. Resistive sensors, or strain gages, are used in electronic measurement and experimental stress analysis systems, as
well as in transducers, for measuring loads (scales), acceleration and fluid pressure.
Fixed resistive components can be broadly categorized as discrete components or networks. A discrete component is designed to perform a single function and is incorporated by the customer in the circuitry of a system which requires that particular function. A network, on the other hand, is a microcircuit (consisting of a number of resistors placed on a ceramic base), which is designed to perform a number of standard functions. Vishay manufactures discrete resistors and networks both of which are principally sold in the precision or higher quality segments of the resistor market (i.e., fixed precision wirewound, metal film and foil resistors and network resistors).
The Company's resistive products primarily consist of fixed resistors (foil and thin film resistors, wire-wound resistors, metal film resistors, oxide film resistors, thermistors, thick film resistor chips, networks (microcircuits) and resistive sensors); variable resistors (trimmers and potentiometers); magnetic components (inductors and transformers) and printed circuit boards. Vishay produces resistors for virtually every segment of the resistive product market, from resistors used in the highest quality precision instruments for which the performance of the resistors is the most important requirement, to resistors for which price is the most important factor.
Capacitors perform energy storage, frequency control, timing and filtering functions in most types of electronic equip- ment. The more important applications for capacitors are (i) electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies, (ii) decoupling and bypass of electronic signals or integrated circuits and circuit boards, and (iii) frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applica- tions. The Company's capacitor products primarily consist of solid tantalum chip capacitors, solid tantalum leaded capacitors, wet/foil tantalum capacitors and film capacitors. The tantalum capacitor is the smallest and most stable type of capacitor for its range of capacitance.
Markets
The Company's products are sold primarily to other manufacturers and, to a much lesser extent, to United States and foreign government agencies. Its products are used in, among other things, the circuitry of measuring instruments, industrial equip- ment, automotive applications including engine controls and fuel injection systems, process control systems, computer-related products, telecommunications, military and aerospace applications, medical instruments and scales.
Approximately 41% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 1993 was attributable to sales to customers in the United States while the remainder was attributable to sales primarily in Europe. In the United States, products are marketed primarily through independent manufacturers' representatives (who are compensated solely on a commission basis), the Company's own sales personnel and independent distributors. The Company has regional sales personnel in several locations to provide technical and sales support for independent manufacturers' representatives throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. In addition, the Company uses independent distributors to resell its products. Internationally, products are sold to customers in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and other European and Pacific Rim countries through Company sales offices, independent manufacturers' representatives and distributors.
The Company endeavors to have its products incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the research and proto- type stages. Vishay employs its own staff of application and field engineers who work with its customers, independent manufacturers' representatives and distributors to solve technical problems and develop products to meet specific needs.
One of the fastest growing markets for passive electronic components is for surface mounted devices. These devices adhere to the surface of a circuit board rather than being secured by leads that pass through holes to the back side of the board. Surface mounting provides certain advantages over through-hole mounting, including the ability to place more components on a circuit board. The Company believes it has taken advantage of the growth of the surface mount market and is an industry leader in designing and marketing surface mount devices. The Company offers a wide range of these devices, including both thick and thin film resistor chips and networks, capacitors, inductors, oscillators, transformers and potentiometers, as well as a number of component packaging styles to facilitate automated product assembly by its customers.
Sales of the Company's products to manufacturers in defense-related industries have continued to decline over the past year, primarily as a result of reduced governmental procurements of defense-related products. The Company has qualified certain products under various military specifications, approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center ("DESC"), and under certain European military specifications. Classification levels have been established by DESC based upon the rate of failure of products to meet specifications (the "Classifi- cation Level"). In order to maintain the Classification Level of a product, tests must be continuously performed, and the results of these tests must be reported to DESC. If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable Classification Level, the product's classification may be reduced to a less stringent level. In that event, the Company's product may not qualify for use as a
component in other products required to meet a more stringent Classification Level, although the Company's product may still be sold for use in other products requiring a less stringent classifi- cation. After completion of additional retesting, however, the product may again be classified at its original level. Sales of the product may be adversely affected pending the completion of any such additional retesting and the resumption of the original Classification Level. Various United States manufacturing facili- ties from time to time experience a product Classification Level modification. During the time that such level is modified for any specific product, net sales and earnings derived from such product may be adversely affected.
The Company is undertaking to have the quality systems at all of its major manufacturing facilities approved under the established ISO 9000 international quality control standard. ISO 9000 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization. Several of the Company's manufacturing operations have already received ISO 9000 approval and others are actively pursuing such approval.
Vishay's largest customers vary from year to year, and no customer has long-term commitments to purchase products of the Company. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 1993.
Research and Development
The Company maintains separate research and development staffs and promotes separate programs at a number of its production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve product and manufacturing techniques. This decentralized system encourages individual product development and, from time to time, developments at one manufacturing facility will have applications at another facility. Most of the Company's products and manufacturing processes have been invented, designed and developed by Company engineers and scientists. Company research and development costs were approximately $7.1 million for 1993, $7.1 million for 1992 and $7.0 million for 1991. The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures. See "Competition".
Sources of Supplies
Although most materials incorporated in the Company's products are available from a number of sources, certain materials (particularly tantalum) are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In order to protect itself from manufacturing disruptions due to potential supply shortages, the Company
maintains a supply of certain critical materials, the nondelivery of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
Tantalum metal is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products. Tantalum is purchased in powder form, primarily under annual contracts with domestic suppliers, at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment. The Company is a major consumer of the world's annual tantalum production. Tantalum, and other required raw materials have generally been available in sufficient quantities, but have been subject to wide price variations. Disruptions in the supply of, or substantial increases in the price of, tantalum metal could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
Inventory and Backlog
Although Vishay manufactures standardized products, a substantial portion of its products are produced to meet specific customer specifications. The Company does, however, maintain an inventory of resistors and other components. Backlog of outstand- ing orders for the Company's products was $198.4 million, $134.3 million and $104.5 million, at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The increase in backlog at December 31, 1993 and 1992, as compared with prior periods, is attributable to the acquisitions of Roederstein and Sprague, respectively. The current backlog is expected to be filled during the next 12 months. Most of the orders in the Company's backlog may be cancelled by its customers, in whole or in part, although sometimes subject to penalty. To date, however, cancellations have not represented a material portion of the backlog.
Competition
The Company faces strong competition in its various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers that produce products using technologies similar to those of the Company. Certain of the Company's products compete on the basis of its marketing and distribution network, which provides a high level of customer service, such as design assistance, order expediting and prompt delivery. In addition, the Company's competitive position depends on its product quality, know-how, proprietary data, marketing and service capabilities, business reputation and price.
A number of the Company's customers are contractors or subcontractors on various United States and foreign government contracts. Under certain United States Government contracts, retroactive adjustments can be made to contract prices affecting the profit margin on such contracts. The Company believes that its profits are not excessive and, accordingly, no provision has been made for any such adjustment.
In several areas the Company strengthens its market position by conducting seminars and educational programs for customers and for potential customers.
Although the Company has numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of its products and manufacturing processes, and acquired various patents with the acquisition of the STI tantalum capacitor and network lines, no particular patent is considered material to the business of the Company.
Manufacturing Operations
The Company conducts manufacturing operations in three principal geographic regions: the United States, Europe and Israel. At December 31, 1993, approximately 40% of the Company's identifiable assets were located in the United States, approximately 50% were located in Europe, approximately 9% were located in Israel and 1% in other regions. In the United States, the Company's main manufacturing facilities are located in Nebraska, South Dakota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Europe, the Company's main manufacturing facilities are located in Selb and Landshut, Germany and Nice and Tours, France. In Israel, manufacturing facilities are located in Holon and Dimona. The Company also maintains manufacturing facilities in Juarez, Mexico and Toronto, Canada.
For the year ended December 31, 1993, sales of products manufactured in Israel accounted for approximately 8% of the Company's net sales. The Company conducts manufacturing operations in Israel in order to take advantage of the relatively low wage rates in Israel and several incentive programs instituted by the Government of Israel, including certain tax abatements. These programs have contributed substantially to the growth and profitability of the Company. The Company may be materially and adversely affected if these incentive programs were no longer available to the Company or if hostilities were to occur in the Middle East that materially interfere with the Company's operations in Israel.
Due to a shift in manufacturing emphasis, resulting from the growing market for surface mount devices, over-capacity at a number of the Company's manufacturing facilities and the relocation of some production to regions with lower labor costs, portions of the Company's work force and certain facilities may not be fully utilized in the future. As a result, the Company may incur significant costs in connection with work force reductions and the closing of additional manufacturing facilities.
Environment
The Company's manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment. The Company is not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings which would require curtailment of its operations at this time. However, the Company is involved in various legal actions concerning state government enforcement proceedings and various dump site clean-ups. These actions may result in fines and/or clean-up expenses. The Company believes that any fine and/or clean-up expense, if imposed, would not be material. The Company continually expends funds to ensure that its facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations. The Company has nearly completed its undertaking to comply with new environmental regulations, relating to the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone depleting substances (ODS), and other anticipated compliances with the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. The Company anticipates that it will undertake capital expenditures of approximately $1,000,000 in fiscal 1994 for general environmental enhancement programs.
Employees
As of December 31, 1993, the Company employed approximately 14,200 full time employees of whom approximately 8,600 were located outside the United States. The Company hires few employees on a part time basis. While many of the Company's foreign employees are members of trade unions, none of the Company's employees located in the United States are represented by unions except for approximately 172 employees at the North Adams, Massachusetts facility acquired from STI, who are represented by three unions. The Company is currently negotiating the collective bargaining agreements of such domestic employees with each of these unions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is excellent.

Introduction and Background
The Company's sales and net income have increased significantly in the past several years primarily as a result of its acquisitions. Following each acquisition, the Company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses. This implementation is reflected in an increase in the Company's sales and in the decline in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of the Company's sales. Since mid-1990, sales of most of the Company's products have been adversely affected by the worldwide slowdown in the electronic components industry. In addition, sales to defense-related industries have declined since the first quarter of 1991. These trends are continuing.
Year ended December 31, 1993 compared to Year ended December 31, 1992
Results of Operations - - - --------------------- Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased by $192,046,000 over the comparable period of the prior year. The increase resulted from the acquisition of Roederstein, effective January 1, 1993. Net sales of Roederstein were $212,124,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993. Net sales, exclusive of Roederstein, decreased by $20,078,000, compared to the same period of the prior year. This decrease in net sales is attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, which resulted in a decrease in reported Vishay sales of $15,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993, and recessionary pressures in Europe.
Costs of products sold for the year ended December 31, 1993 were 77.5% of net sales as compared to 76.5% for the comparable period of the prior year. The reason for this increase is that the costs of products sold for Roederstein (prior to the full implementation of synergistic cost reductions) are approx- imately 80% of net sales, while Vishay's business, exclusive of Roederstein, has been operating in the 76% to 78% range. In 1993, grants of $3,424,000 received from the government of Israel, which were utilized to offset start-up costs of new facilities, were recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1993 were 13.9% of net sales as compared to 15.3% for the comparable period of the prior year. The current year's lower rates reflect the effect of the acquisition of
Roederstein and the ongoing cost savings programs implemented with the acquisition of certain businesses of STI during 1992.
Restructuring charges of $6,659,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 consist primarily of severance costs related to the Company's decision to downsize its European operations, primarily in France, as a result of the European business climate.
Income from unusual items of $7,221,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 represents proceeds received for business interruption insurance claims principally related to operations in Dimona, Israel.
Interest costs increased by $1,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 as a result of increased debt incurred for the acquisition of Roederstein.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 1993 decreased by $4,410,000 over the comparable period of the prior year because other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 included consulting fees of $2,307,000 from Roederstein. These fees to Vishay were for time and expenses of Vishay personnel utilized by Roederstein in its attempt to restructure itself. Also, other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 included fees of approximately $3,325,000 from STI under one-year sales and distribution agreements. Foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $1,382,000, as compared to foreign currency losses of $1,594,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992.
The effective tax rate of 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 1993 reflects the non-taxability of certain insurance recoveries. The 1993 rate was also affected by increased manufacturing in Israel, where the Company's average income tax rate was approximately 4% in 1993. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1993, exclusive of the effect of the non- taxable insurance proceeds, was 18.6%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1992 was 19.8%.
Accounting Changes - - - ------------------ Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase net income by $1,427,000. Application of the new income tax rules also decreased pretax earnings by $2,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 because of increased depreciation expense as a result of Statement 109's requirement to report assets acquired in prior business combinations at their pretax amounts.
The Company also adopted FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", effective January 1, 1993. The Company has elected to recognize the transition obligation on a prospective basis over a twenty-year period. In 1993, the new standard resulted in additional annual net periodic postretirement benefit costs of $1,200,000 before taxes, and $792,000 after taxes, or $0.04 per share. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to apply the new standard.
Year ended December 31, 1992 compared to Year ended December 31, 1991
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1992 increased $221,943,000 over the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was the result of the inclusion of the businesses acquired from STI effective as of January 1, 1992. Net sales of the acquired businesses were $230,492,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992. For the year ended December 31, 1992, net sales, exclusive of the acquired businesses, decreased by $8,549,000 compared to the same period of the prior year when recessionary pressures affecting sales were not as great.
The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies resulted in an increase in reported Vishay sales of $10,418,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992.
Costs of products sold for the year ended December 31, 1992 were 76.5% of net sales as compared to 71.9% for the comparable period of the prior year. The reason for this increase is that the costs of products sold for the newly purchased businesses from STI (prior to any synergistic cost reductions) are 80% of net sales, while Vishay's resistor businesses traditionally operate at levels of 70% to 75%.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1992 were 15.3% of net sales compared to 17.2% for the comparable period of the prior year. The 15.3% rate reflects the effect of the businesses acquired from STI. The rate applicable to the businesses acquired from STI (approximately 11%) includes the effects of initial cost saving programs installed subsequent to the acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 1992, selling, general and administrative expenses of the Vishay resistor business (approximately 17%) were comparable to the levels experienced in the prior year.
Interest costs increased by $3,903,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992 as a result of the increased debt incurred for the purchase of the businesses from STI.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 includes consulting fees of $2,307,000 from Roederstein. Other income for the year ended December 31, 1992 also includes fees of approxi-
mately $3,325,000 from STI under one-year sales and distribution agreements expiring February 14, 1993, which were entered into in connection with the acquisition of the businesses from STI.
The effective tax rate was 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 1992. The effective rate is comparable to the rate of 23.3% for 1991. The 1992 rate was in part affected by increased manufacturing in Israel where the Company's average income tax rate was 7% for 1992.
Year ended December 31, 1991 compared to Year ended December 31, 1990
Net sales decreased by $3,313,000 or approximately 1% to $442,283,000 for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $445,596,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990. Sales increased in the United States by 2.7% as a result of acquisitions, which partially offset the effect of the worldwide recession. Sales in Western Europe declined 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 1990 as a result of the recession and the strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies. Price increases did not materially affect sales.
Costs of products sold increased to $318,166,000 or 71.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $312,925,000 or 70.2% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1990. The increase in costs of products sold as a percentage of sales reflects increased production costs of relatively flat sales in addition to certain manufacturing inefficiencies during the latter part of 1991.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $75,973,000 or 17.2% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $77,740,000 or 17.4% of sales for the year ended December 31, 1990 primarily because of the continuation of cost reduction programs introduced during 1990.
Expenses of approximately $3,700,000 for layoff costs at the Company's European subsidiaries were incurred during the latter half of 1991. This correction to the work force was made to strengthen the subsidiaries' ability to attain earnings goals and to respond to the current recession.
Interest expense decreased by $4,219,000 to $15,207,000 for the year ended December 31, 1991 from $19,426,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990 primarily as a result of payments made on long-term debt and lower interest rates.
Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 1991 were $289,000 compared to income of $2,344,000 for the year ended December 31, 1990, primarily due to decreases in investment grants from Israel and interest income. Investment grants and interest
income for the year ended December 31, 1991 were $106,000 and $797,000, respectively, compared to $980,000 and $2,257,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1990.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1991 was 23.3% versus 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 1990. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a reduced tax rate for certain Israeli operations and an increase in the propor- tion of earnings taxable in Israel. The lower rate was primarily due to tax advantages of doing business in Israel where the Company's effective average tax rate was approximately 10% at that time.
Financial Condition
Cash flows from operations were $50,114,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to $54,357,000 for the prior year and were used primarily to finance capital expenditures. Purchases of property and equipment were $76,813,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to $49,801,000 for the prior year primarily due to additions of manufacturing equipment for surface mount products and expansion of manufacturing facilities in Israel. The Company's financial condition at December 31, 1993 is strong with the Company's current ratio of 2.1 to 1. The Company's ratio of long-term debt to stockholders' equity was .7 to 1 at December 31, 1993 as compared to .4 to 1 at December 31, 1992. The increase in this ratio resulted from additional borrowings in connection with the acquisition of Roederstein.
In connection with the Roederstein acquisition, Vishay entered into a DM 104,316,000 term loan agreement with its lending banks in January 1993. In addition, an Israeli subsidiary of Vishay borrowed $20 million pursuant to an unsecured credit agreement. The funds from the credit facilities were used in connection with the Roederstein acquisition and the refinancing of Roederstein's debt. Vishay and the Banks also amended certain terms of the outstanding $170,000,000 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 10, 1992 among Vishay and the Banks and the Amended and Restated DM 42,375,000 Revolving Credit and DM 57,036,000 Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 10, 1992 among Vishay, Draloric and the lending banks in order to, among other things, allow Vishay to draw upon its revolving credit facilities to refinance a portion of Roederstein's debt.
See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere herein for additional information with respect to Vishay's loan agreements, long-term debt and available short- term credit lines.
Management believes that available sources of credit, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's anticipated financing needs
for working capital and capital expenditures during the next twelve months.
Inflation
Normally, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations. The Company's products are not generally sold on long-term contracts. Consequently, selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, can be adjusted to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.

Report of Independent Auditors
Board of Directors and Stockholders Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 1993 the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes (Note 5) and postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 10).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1993
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
Depreciation
Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was $43,493,000, $30,995,000, and $23,706,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.
Goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Accumulated amortization amounted to $10,945,000 and $7,679,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Research and Development Expenses
The amount charged to expense aggregated $7,097,000, $7,149,000, and $6,967,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
Grants
Grants received from governments by certain foreign subsidiaries are recognized as income when conditions for receipt are met. In 1993, grants of $3,424,000 received from the government of Israel, which were utilized to offset startup costs of new facilities, were recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares (from the assumed conversion of convertible subordinated debentures) outstanding during the period. In October 1992, the convertible subordinated debentures were converted into 2,536,783 shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 1992, where assumed conversion of the debentures has a dilutive effect, net earnings used in the computations are adjusted for interest expense, net of income taxes, on the convertible subordinated debentures. Earnings per share amounts for all periods presented reflect 5% stock dividends paid on June 11, 1993, June 16, 1992, and June 11, 1991. Earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 reflect the weighted effect of the issuance of 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock on December 24, 1992.
Accounting Changes
In 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes (Note 5) and postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 10).
Reclassifications
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
2. Acquisitions
During January 1993, Vishay exercised its option to purchase the remaining 81% of the outstanding share capital of Roederstein GmbH, a passive electronic components manufacturer with headquarters in Germany for 4,050,000 Deutsche Marks ("DM") ($2,502,000) pursuant to an option agreement dated February 18, 1992. Vishay had acquired its initial 19% interest in Roederstein on February 18, 1992 for DM 950,000 ($577,000). In connection with the acquisition, Vishay refinanced all of Roederstein's existing bank debt of DM 160,381,000 ($99,062,000). Funds to refinance Roederstein's debt were provided by a DM 104,316,000 term loan with a group of banks, $20,000,000 borrowed under an unsecured credit agreement, and borrowings under an existing line of credit.
Effective January 1, 1992, the Company acquired the worldwide tantalum capacitor and U.S. thick film resistor network businesses of Sprague Technologies, Inc. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Vishay paid $127,000,000 cash, transferred to Sprague real property with a fair value of $4,771,000, and assumed certain liabilities relating to the businesses. Vishay also entered into certain ancillary agreements with the seller, including one-year sales and distribution agreements under which Vishay received fees of $3,325,000 during 1992, which are included in other income. The purchase price was funded primarily from a $125,000,000 term loan facility.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
2. Acquisitions (continued)
The acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The operating results of Roederstein and Sprague have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations from January 1, 1993 and January 1, 1992, respectively. Excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (Roederstein--$45,210,000; Sprague--$19,534,000) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.
Had the Roederstein and Sprague acquisitions been made at the beginning of the year prior to their acquisition, the Company's pro forma unaudited results would have been (in thousands, except per share amounts):
Year ended December 31 1992 1991 ------------------------- Net sales $913,398 $679,183 Net earnings (loss) (22,992) 20,591 Earnings (loss) per share $(1.19) $1.24
The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or of results which may occur in the future. Pro forma net earnings for 1992 reflect $31,860,000 of restructuring costs incurred by Roederstein for work force reductions.
During 1992, Vishay provided Roederstein with management and sales support, short-term working capital advances, and assistance in renegotiating Roederstein's bank debt. Vishay also assisted Roederstein in developing a cost-savings program involving reductions in the Roederstein work force, including the closing of an unprofitable division. Vishay recognized consulting fees, which are included in other income, from Roederstein of $2,307,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992 for its assistance to Roederstein. As of December 31, 1992, Vishay had investments in Roederstein of $3,229,000, advances to Roederstein, included in other assets, of $16,918,000, accounts receivable and other current receivables from Roederstein of $5,166,000, and accounts payable to Roederstein of $1,158,000.
The Company made several minor acquisitions in 1993 and 1991, all of which were accounted for under the purchase method. The results of operations of these businesses have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from the dates of acquisition.
3. Restructuring Expense and Unusual Items
Restructuring expenses of $6,659,000 for 1993 related to the downsizing of some of the Company's European operations. Income from unusual items of $7,221,000 for 1993 represents insurance recoveries the Company has received for business interruption insurance claims.
The Company incurred restructuring costs of $3,700,000 in 1991 relating primarily to costs associated with layoffs in France.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
4. Foreign Subsidiaries
The following amounts relating to foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands):
5. Income Taxes
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As permitted under the new rules, prior years' financial statements have not been restated.
The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase net earnings by $1,427,000, or $.07 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1993, application of the new income tax rules decreased pretax income by $2,870,000 because of increased depreciation expense as a result of Statement 109's requirement to report assets acquired in prior business combinations at their pretax amounts.
At December 31, 1993, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $96,300,000 in Germany (no expiration date), $3,100,000 in France (expire December 31, 1998), and $1,800,000 in Portugal (expire December 31, 1997). Approximately $70,800,000 of the carryforward in Germany, and the full $1,800,000 in Portugal, resulted from the Company's acquisition of Roederstein. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance of $34,862,000 has been recognized to offset deferred tax assets related to German net operating loss carryforwards. If tax benefits are recognized in the future through reductions of the valuation allowance, such amounts will reduce goodwill of acquired companies. The valuation allowance decreased from January 1, 1993 by $6,584,000 primarily due to a decrease in German tax rates which had the effect of reducing the deferred tax asset for German net operating loss carryforwards.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
5. Income Taxes (continued)
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):
Deferred tax liabilities: Tax over book depreciation $57,401 Other--net 2,685 --------- Total deferred tax liabilities 60,086 --------- Deferred tax assets: Pension and other retiree obligations 20,179 Net operating loss carryforwards 38,773 Restructuring reserves 7,354 Other accruals and reserves 12,300 --------- Total deferred tax assets 78,606 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (34,862) --------- Net deferred tax assets 43,744 --------- Net deferred tax liabilities $16,342 ========= For financial reporting purposes, earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change includes the following components (in thousands):
Year ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 ---------------------------------- Pretax income: Domestic $13,136 $10,252 $8,519 Foreign 37,758 27,672 18,734 ---------------------------------- $50,894 $37,924 $27,253 ==================================
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
5. Income Taxes (continued)
Significant components of income taxes attributable to continuing operations are as follows (in thousands):
Liability Method Deferred Method -------------------------------- Year ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 -------------------------------- Current: U.S. Federal $3,032 $1,639 $3,558 Foreign 2,706 2,521 1,706 State 332 502 675 -------------------------------- 6,070 4,662 5,939 Deferred: U.S. Federal 1,960 1,760 103 Foreign 36 832 312 State 180 257 9 -------------------------------- 2,176 2,849 424 -------------------------------- $8,246 $7,511 $6,363 ================================
For the year ended December 31, 1992, deferred income taxes resulted from accelerated methods of depreciation used for tax purposes ($2,494,000) and restructuring reserves ($2,012,000). These amounts were partially offset by differences relating to inventory valuation methods ($900,000) and other items ($757,000). For the year ended December 31, 1991, deferred taxes resulted principally from use of accelerated methods of depreciation for tax purposes.
A reconciliation of income tax at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax expense is as follows (in thousands):
Liability Method Deferred Method -------------------------------- Year ended December 31 1993 1992 1991 -------------------------------- Tax at statutory rate $17,304 $12,894 $9,266 State income taxes, net of federal tax 396 501 452 Effect of foreign income tax rates (10,532) (5,649) (5,166) Effect of purchase accounting adjustments 717 939 1,291 Other 361 (1,174) 520 -------------------------------- $8,246 $7,511 $6,363 ================================
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
5. Income Taxes (continued)
At December 31, 1993, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on approximately $169,678,000 of foreign earnings which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.
Income taxes paid were $6,933,000, $5,729,000 and $8,418,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

10. Postretirement Medical Benefits
The Company pays limited health care premiums for certain eligible retired U.S. employees. Prior to 1993, the cost of these benefits, which was not significant, was charged to expense when the benefits were paid.
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Under this new standard, the Company recognizes the cost of postretirement benefits over the active service period of its employees. The Company elected to recognize the transition obligation, which represents the previously unrecognized prior service cost, on a prospective basis over a twenty-year period. In 1993, the new standard resulted in additional annual net periodic postretirement benefit cost of $1,200,000 before taxes and $792,000 after taxes, or $0.04 per share. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to apply the new standard.
Net postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1993 included the following components (in thousands):
Service cost $ 351 Interest cost 713 Net amortization and deferral 424 ------- Net postretirement benefit cost $ 1,488 =======
The cost information does not include the effects of Plan amendments made at the end of 1993, which are expected to reduce future costs. Cash payments for these benefits were $288,000 for 1993. The Company continues to fund postretirement medical benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The status of the plan and amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation: Retirees $(2,234) Actives eligible to retire (956) Other actives (3,028) ------------ Total (6,218) Unrecognized loss 955 Unrecognized transition obligation 4,063 ------------ Accrued postretirement benefit liability $(1,200) ============ The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reflects Plan amendments made at the end of 1993 which capped employer contributions for each participant at the 1993 dollar amounts. The discount rate used in the calculation was 7.5%.

11. Leases
Total rental expense under operating leases was $7,528,000, $9,577,000, and $4,435,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows: 1994-- $5,694,000; 1995--$4,226,000; 1996--$3,582,000; 1997--$2,947,000; 1998-- $2,602,000; thereafter--$7,492,000
12. Financial Instruments
Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk. The amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and for short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value.

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>This dataset card is based on the paper <strong>EDGAR-CORPUS: Billions of Tokens Make The World Go Round</strong> authored by <em>Lefteris Loukas et.al</em>, as published in the <em>ECONLP 2021</em> workshop.</p>
<p>This dataset contains the annual reports of public companies from 1993-2020 from SEC EDGAR filings. </p>
<p>There is supported functionality to load a specific year.</p>
<p>Care: since this is a corpus dataset, different <code>train/val/test</code> splits do not have any special meaning. It's the default HF card format to have train/val/test splits.</p>
<p>If you wish to load specific year(s) of specific companies, you probably want to use the open-source software which generated this dataset, EDGAR-CRAWLER: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/nlpaueb/edgar-crawler">https://github.com/nlpaueb/edgar-crawler</a>.</p>
