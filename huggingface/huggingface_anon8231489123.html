Be there in 20. -L \nStranger: Good. -N \nYou: Liam doesnt wait to check his parking when he storms the place. Come meet me -L he sends when he exits his car into the driveway in search of the Omega. \nStranger: Nico glanced to his phone, smiling to himself. He was still contemplating how much he wanted to tease the other before letting the Alpha fuck him again. If he ever did. The blond walked out, pushing up his glasses. You could have met me inside and let me put contacts in, asshole. \nYou: I know the routine, Liam smirks and pretends to shrug nonchalantly. I just wanted to break it to annoy you, cause its just too easy. Have anything to say? \nStranger: He growled a little, standing on his tiptoes so he could grab the others collar. Shut. Up. He crashed their lips together, eyes closed. \nYou: His instincts pick up immediately, and he grips the other boys wrist in one hand and his hip in the other. He answered the kiss fiercely and still made time to leave a bite on Nicos bottom lip. \nStranger: He moans softly, melting as the other takes control. Even if they fought, and were wrong for each other, there was no denying how good it felt. By the time Nico pulled away his lenses had fogged up. \nYou: Looks like still win, Liam smirks, hands still tight around Nicos hip and hand. It was too satisfying to know he could get away with what he knew was wrong. Now get to choose what to do with this sore loser. \nStranger: Though his face was contorted to seem tough, the Omega couldnt help his little whimper as he stared up. Maybe this time he wouldnt be getting his way. Please, he mumbled, rolling his eyes. \nYou: Look as disappointed as you want. You still smell like you need a thick knot in you, he growled, licking his lips. And Im more than happy to provide. And if it makes you feel better, Ill let you choose between your room or my car. \nStranger: Nico hadnt even noticed how much slick had soaked his panties, his pale skin blushing at the thought. The car. Hed managed through the words without completely stumbling, though his hands clung onto the Alpha desperately. \nYou: Still desperate to just surround yourself in my scent even thought Im not even an inch in front of you. Greedy little bitch, he chuckled, gripping the Omega by the shirt and opening the cars backseat to shove him inside and later follow suit. \nStranger: He scrambled in, overwhelmed by the Alpha. He was quick to undress, not caring if it made him look even more submissive. He was hot and horny, making sure his backside faced Liam for quite a bit of time. \nYou: Liam made short work of stripping himself of his shirt and shoving his pants down. Fuck, youre so fucking wet, he breathed, reveling in the scent and feeling his cock harden. Always so horny. What am to do with you? he mock- sighed, tracing the other boys hairline before grabbing a fistful and tugging. \nStranger: Uh! He gasped when the other pulled at his curls. Nicos back arched, fully at the olders disposal. F- Fuck me, obviously, he grubted. \nYou: Youre insufferable. Still giving me attitude when youre at my mercy, he growled, leaning down and clamping his teeth over the Omegas neck and sucking hard. At the same time he used his free hand to navigate the boys body and thrust into his still-leaking entrance. \nStranger: He didnt have time to object, busy with the others finger working his needy hole. Oh! More! he begged. \nYou: He hummed against his skin, shaking his head and finding a new spot to suck a hickey into. dont think so. Im still having fun watching you squirm and beg. \nStranger: Nico was practically shaking, jolting in pleasure every now and then. His moans were needy, filling the car with squeaks a jumbled nonsense. The Omega was so lusty, wondering what it would feel like to really be marked. Slick trickled out of him, the boy moving to rub his small cock. \nYou: Not tonight, baby, he grunted, letting go of the Omegas hair to grab his wrist as he reached for his cock. Liam found the boys other hand and pinned them both over his head as he continued to finger and play with his slick-wet hole. The only way youre gonna cum is from my knot. Any second opinion, my little bitch? \nStranger: He mewled and rocked for awhile, desperate for friction. Still, the boy settled, finally murmuring. No Sir, he squeaked, voice smaller and high pitched. \nYou: Liam smirked in his triumph, actually beginning to stretch Nicos hole to prepare him for his cock. Good boy. Im gonna fill you up in just a sec, alright? \nStranger: He nodded, getting more and more restless. Yes, god yes he sighed, his plump ass bouncing as he was stretched. Nico didnt even care how much he was surrendering. He needed an Alpha knot. \nYou: Good boy, he repeated, almost getting lost as he watched Nicos response to him fingering him open. This is mine, and Im gonna fucking knot it, he breathed, positioning himself over the Omega and lining his cock up with his ass, then roughly pushing himself in with a low groan. \nStranger: The Omegas mouth fell open, head tilted back. Fuck! he cried, hips desperate to get into the fastest rhythm possible. Oh, Sir You feel so good, so big \nYou: You like that? he chuckled breathlessly, leaning back down to claim the boys neck with his teeth as he experimented with the different times he would thrust his hips. God, youre so fucking wet. could fuck you for hours.. \nStranger: He nodded eagerly, whimpering and longing for Liams knot. His slicked-up hole took the males cock easily, and to Nico the sting felt too good to go slow. Please, please go harder! \nYou: You little whore, he grunted, muscles straining as he adjusted himself to properly fuck the Omega underneath him. He was getting more forceful with his thrusts, filling his hole to the full hilt of his cock. My pretty Omega bitch. \nStranger: He smiled, biting his lip in pleasure and trying not to scream out. Please, please knot me. Fill me up, need cum, he pleaded. \nYou: Liam panted, quickening his pace and tightening his grip on the boys hips. He bit his lip as he fucked more deeply into the Omega, before cumming long and hard with a low groan. His knot was large, stretching the hole out even further while Liam simply watched his own cum leaking out along with the spilled slick. \nStranger: Nico gave one last moan, feeling himself climax as the other came inside him. He panted, laying back and pushing up his glasses. \nYou: It took a minute of calming down to feel his knot still throbbing inside Nico, and he pulled the boys thighs apart to settle more comfortably on the car seat. Looks like well be here for a while, Liam said after gaining his breath. He reached over and touched the Omegas little cock, giving it a stroke or two to see his reaction. \nStranger: The stimulation made him jump, gulping. Dude! What the hell, he huffed, wiping the sweat off his forehead. \nYou: Wouldve been more fun if you were on your heat like last time, he huffed himself, brushing his sweat-dampened hair back with his fingers. \nStranger: Well you got me knocked up that time and had to get an abortion so \nStranger: *sorry!! \nStranger: Well you got me knocked up that time and had to get an abortion so, he mumbled, though he never told Liam about that. \nYou: Oh NP! \nYou: Liam stayed quiet for a moment, trying to register if hed ever been given this information beforehand. Youre not kidding, are you? though youd taken pills or something when we did that. \nStranger: I did, but you knotted me when was in heat. He looked away from the other. \nYou: You said didnt have to pull out! he defended, then again falling silent. Did you plan on telling any this to me til now? \nStranger: I dont know. He crossed his arms, looking up. Why do you care? \nYou: I knocked you up? he said, quietly but with clear incredulity. I bred you and think thats enough for me to give a shit about. couldnt at least have been there when you aborted? \nStranger: I dont need you, okay? Its fine, less of a burden to you. He closed his eyes, thinking for a moment. He was silent for quite some time. Im sorry, okay? \nYou: He was frowning, but it was obscured by the dark, and difficult angle. Yeah, whatever, Just...tell me next time something like that happens, he sighed, sliding his hand along Nicos thigh. wanna at least be partly responsible for the things we do. \nStranger: Nico tried not to overthink the we part, staring up at the other and trying to place Liams feelings. Right. Well um. \nYou: Dont think about it too hard. get it. You dont need me, and this is just sex to take the edge off your horny Omega tendencies. Liam leaned back against the car window, a hand over his lower stomach where he could still feel his knot pulsing.&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;005f6ec2b2b2af8c&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Omegaverse&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20180721071205&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You: YO \nStranger: knock knock \nYou: whos there \nStranger: not my dad&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;00735a03ed50209b&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;discord&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20210322015445&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You: Evening, Moran.

They admitted that they liked each other, probably kissed, but their relationship isnt very developed.) It was weekends like this that he really enjoyed his dads job. It had put Howard and Maria Stark far away from their home ina time zone which meant theyd be too asleep to bother Tony while half the school ran drunk through the mansions hallways. He had no idea that the trip had already ended for his parents, that they were lying dead in a wrecked car and that any fun he had at the party would be ruined by one phone call in the morning. Instead, he grinned widely as he walked through the crowded rooms ina large Christmas sweater, pushing past his guests to get to the door after getting the text that Bruce had finally gotten there, after a lot of convincing just to get him to show up. He already had a drink in his hand to offer his boyfriend and a few too many in his system to think about whether this was a good idea or not \nStranger: Bruce wasnt too into parties, but hed gotten a little more used it with Tony. He wore a second hand green sweater with some snowflakes stitched into it. He made his way into the mansion, still in awe of how huge it was. When he finally saw Tony, a bit of relief washed over him and he came over to greet him with a light kiss. Hey. Youre not too drunk already, are you? he asked, a little concerned, though he took a sip from the drink Tony offered him. More people than expected... \nYou: In the end, Tony had been thoroughly impressed with himself when he got Bruce to come at all, and dressed for the occasion no less. There you are. Tony grinned when the other found him, slipping an arm around Bruces waist to lean into the quick kiss. ...Im not Atoo/ drunk. Tony rolled his eyes, leading his boyfriend through the crowd of people. Despite the front room being enormous, it was still tightly packed. Well the whole school came...just about, anyway, Its finally Christmas vacation. Everyone wants to party before they have to go do things with their family for the holiday. \nStranger: Yeah, but Id be just as fine without the... audience, Bruce mumbled, staying close to Tonys side. This was still a lot for him to take in, but with Tony it was easier. When they got to a place where it wasnt as crowded, he let outa long breath. So...Are you still going away with your parents for Christmas? Or do you think you could stay? he asked softly, taking Tonys hand to hold. Not that you cant go with them. Just... Id love to see you if we got the chance. \nYou: Audience? Theyre only staring because theyre wondering how an asshole like me got such a cute date. Dont mind them. Tony was half right, they were staring because of him, because of his reputation of losing partners as fast as he could get them, wondering how long this one could last. My parents wont be home until after New Years, so, Im all yours for Christmas if you dont mind me being so clingy. Tony smiled at him, intertwining their fingers. \nStranger: All mine, hm? Bruce smiled and leaned ina little closer. might be spending a lot of time here then, he hummed. Taking another long sip from his glass, Bruce shook his head a little. dont know how got lucky enough to be with a guy like you. Didnt think youd ever notice me, really. \nYou: Id like that...you could help me put up the tree. We always saved it until Christmas Eve, just a tradition...of course, usually, the tradition would be for my parents to be around on Christmas. Tony shook his head, trying not to sound bitter. You could pack a bag and stay, even. A vacation away from that house. Tony knew Bruce didnt like talking about his home life, but Tony couldnt stand the thought of him in there. Of course noticed you, you were my best friend, it just took me too long to actually do something about it. \nStranger: Better late than never, Bruce teased softly. Id love to stay here. The perfect vacation. He nuzzled Tonys cheek lightly, pressing a light kiss to his skin. It was nice to have a safe space, where he didnt have to worry. Well have the best Christmas ever. No parents, just us. Whatever we want all day. Maybe you could even take us on a day trip to pick out a tree. \nYou: Tony smiled wider when Bruce agreed, curling his arms around his waist and hooking his fingers under the green sweater. That sounds perfect. Tony had to pause for a series of excited shrieking, which either came from the change in music or someone finding another liquor cabinet. -do you think a tree would fit on the back of my convertible? Tony laughed, leading Bruce a little further off from the crowd. \nStranger: Bruce laughed and shook his head. I guess not, he said, absently leaning into the little touches. We could get a smaller one though, just for us. Or rent something bigger, he said. Maybe... maybe just stay here and relax for a while. Enjoy having this place all to ourselves. \nYou: Ill take us out to this place upstate, we can pick one out and theyll deliver it...they dont have very many small ones, though. Tony closed his eyes as he leaned in, pressing his lips towards Bruces neck. Well have weeks all to our own. \nStranger: Bruce tilted his head back to give Tony more space, humming happily. Sounds perfect, he sighed, relaxing in Tonys arms. Tony... Tony, come on. We still- theres people, he mumbled, grinning to himself. \nYou: While the words might have sounded like he was complaining, Tony could practically hear the grin in Bruces voice, and the way he tilted his head back encouraged Tony to press in closer, trailing his lips up the soft skin of Bruces neck, gently giving it a little nip. What? Do you want me to stop? Tony murmured, speaking against his skin. \nStranger: Ah- just... no, Bruce admitted, closing his eyes. He made a soft, pleased sound and wrapped his arms over Tonys shoulders. Maybe just... find someplace more private? he mumbled. \nYou: Tony glanced up from the others neck, warm breath sweeping across his skin. There were definitely people watching them now. Of course, he knew the private places, every inch of the house, but itd be more fun to let Bruce find one. Ill follow you. Tony nodded for him to lead the way, before returning his lips to Bruces neck like they were pulled by a magnet \nStranger: Bruce couldnt help a happy sigh when he felt Tonys lips on him again, smiling despite himself. The attention wasnt so terrible, but he was already blushing like mad. He took Tonys hand and slipped down the hall, trying to remember which ones would be a good spot to hide away. He opened the door to the study and pulled Tony inside with him. Is this one okay? he whispered. \nYou: Tony glanced up when he heard the handle of a door turning, and felt Bruce tug him inside. Its perfect. Tony murmured back, and this time led Bruce, to a soft leather couch in the center of the study. Bruce had picked one of his favorite rooms. Tony sat them down, one hand curled over Bruce as he leaned in again, sucking slowly on the skin of his neck. ...this is okay, right? Tony mumbled, wanting Bruce to be comfortable. \nStranger: Yeah. More than okay, Bruce sighed, sinking back into the couch while Tony leaned in. , Whatever you want. Ill tell you if its too much, he promised, reaching up to stroke his fingers through Tonys hair. \nYou: Tony nodded at the reassurance, going back to soft kisses for a moment. He couldnt help the quiet little breath of enjoyment when he felt fingers in his hair, biting down slowly on Bruces neck with the promise Bruce wouldnt let him take it too far. \nStranger: Ah- Bruce moaned, his breath hitching a little when Tony started to get a little rougher. He held onto him tighter, fingers gripping at the sweater. Tony... \nYou: The moan in his ear was perfect, and it only pushed him to latch on to the spot he bit, intent on leaving at least some kind of mark. Tony curled his arms further around Bruces waist, shifting to his knees to lean over him. \nStranger: Bruce was left breathless, not bothering to stay too quiet since they were in the room alone. He cupped the back of Tonys head, playing with his hair and gently pressing him, encouraging more. Hed definitely have some marks left, and just the thought brought another pleased sound from his throat. \nYou: God, every sound he drew out from Bruce was incredible, and he just wanted to hear more. Tony curved one knee over Bruces thighs until he was positioned over his lap, having to pause and catch his breath, running his tongue over the fresh mark. ...-fuck. He said breathlessly, shaking his head. -youre perfect. \nStranger: Bruce wrapped an arm around Tonys waist to pull him closer. Ah... thats gonna last a while, he mumbled, smiling. You, uh... want me to do it for you too? he asked, not too sure how this worked, not having much relationship experience at all. \nYou: Tony couldnt help but chuckle a little at the offer, pressing his forehead into Bruces shoulder and looking up at him. The others uncertainty, the little nervousness about what to do, it was adorable. You dont have to. Tony assured him, before adding. ...but Id love it. My neck is my absolute weak spot. \nStranger: Yeah? Good to know that, Bruce smiled bashfully, turning his head to kiss the side of Tonys head. Id like to try that. And Im not near perfect, he added. \nYou: Go ahead then. Tony hummed as he leaned towards the kiss against his head. Everything in the moment with Bruce felt absolutely perfect. Of course you are. Tony mumbled back. I said so. \nStranger: Just because you say something doesnt make it true automatically, Bruce smiled, slipping his hand under the edge of Tonys sweater. He shifted just a little to nuzzle and kiss at Tonys neck, starting small. \nYou: ...hm, that doesnt sound right to me. Tony grinned faintly, leaning towards the hand that brushed under his sweater and closing his eyes again, head tilting to tbe side to give Bruce room. He chewed on his lip, breathing in a little sharper at the first few kisses. \nStranger: Bruce smiled against Tonys skin, nipping lightly along Tonys jaw up to a spot just under his ear where he nipped a little harder, sucking more. He paid attention to how Tony reacted, not wanting to hurt him. \nYou: Tony hadnt been sure if Bruce would know what he was doing, but it definitely felt like he did. Tony tensed at the bite, his body shivering and his hands tightening their grip on Bruce, a moan slipping through his lips as Bruce sucked more, \nStranger: Bruce closed his eyes, humming against Tonys skin while he sucked over the mark. The sounds he made were beautiful to Bruce, reminding him that this was real, they were together and it wasnt some kind of joke. I could get used to this, he whispered, nipping lightly at his earlobe. \nYou: Tony chuckled a little, laying his head back. It was almost a shame his only plans were with Bruce and he wouldnt get to show the mark off to anyone. ...so could I. Tony breathed in response, groaning a little. Youre...good at this. \nStranger: Bruce grinned, pulling back to kiss Tony gently on the lips. Am I? Im just trying to do like what you did, he smiled, lightly tracing his fingers along Tonys lower back. \nYou: Tony closed his eyes again as he pressed back into Bruces lips, grinning back at him. .well youre a quick learner then, fuck. \nStranger: Bruce smiled and kissed him back happily. Youre a good teacher, what can say? he hummed, using his free hand to cup Tonys cheek. Can tell you something kinda embarrassing? he asked softly. I... remember our first date? And that- you kissed me when you took me back home. That was my first kiss, he admitted. \nYou: ((Be right back sorry!)) \nStranger: actually its getting pretty late for me here. do you wanna continue in email or something? \nStranger: my email is still. .brucebannergmail.com if you want. thanks for the rp, even if you dont want to.

IA (Before Nero was bom, they agreed that their son would be safer away from London ) \nStranger: ((We roleplayed yesterday and my phone messed up!)) \nYou: ((oh we did? :D and mine does that too it sucks )) \nStranger: Sherlock sat with his legs both side of the young boy as he finished the beautiful tower there you go, Nero. He couldnt help but smile slightly knock it down. He looked at Irene this simple activity allows Nero to understand cause and effect and the irreversibility of damaging without the input of work. \nStranger: ((Yeah it was the one based in the fourth season.)) \nYou: ((oh i remember now! thanks :) )) \nYou: Nero stood up and glanced at his parents again before he knocked the tower down once more, starting to giggle again. He was smart for his age, though he still didnt understand what his father meant. Again, again. He said happily and clasped his hands together as he bounced up and down in front of his father. \nStranger: He couldnt help but smile at the childs excitement. Okay, sit back down please. He smiled and started building again, finally feeling at peace fora long time. \nStranger: for the first time in a long Gomez \nStranger: *time. \nYou: Irene smirked as she watched the two and see how happy both seemed, though Nero seemed happier. He nodded and sat back down as he helped his father build another tower. Maybe it wasnt a bad idea to tell Sherlock to just come by. \nStranger: He smiled and built another beautiful tower. He watched Nero happily, rubbing the little boys back gently, he leamt that helped children when he was Teading up on them. \nYou: Instead of just one tower, Nero wanted to build another one so they could both knock down a tower. Irene ruffled her sons curls and got up when she was sure that the two of them got along. Are you hungry? can make us a snack. She offered them both and Nero nodded. I want a sandwich please. He said politely with a large grin on his face. \nStranger: Sherlock smiled and knocked down the tower with his son Im fine thank you. He used his manners for once to encourage his son to, although he never usually would. \nYou: Alright. She smiled at the two and went into the kitchen to make Nero and herself a sandwich. Are you going to stay? Nero asked him quietly as he started to build a house now with the bricks. \nStranger: ((How old is Nero?)) \nYou: ( was thinking maybe 3? What do you think? ) \nStranger: (Thats perfect!) \nYou: ((okay :))) \nStranger: He shrugged I have to go back to work soon... he admitted. He still had to sort out all this Moriaty stuff and protect John. \nYou: Okay... he mumbled and look down before he continued to build the little house he was making. \nStranger: He sighed slightly and got up I should go and help mummy. He walked to the kitchen and sat down, thinking quietly. \nYou: Nero just nodded and quietly continued to play. Meanwhile, Irene was preparing their sandwiches when Sherlock walked in. Everything alright? She asked and glanced at him over her shoulder, worried that Sherlock and Nero suddenly didnt get along. \nStranger: ((Hello?)) \nYou: ((sorry i think mine didnt send!)) \nYou: Nero just nodded and quietly continued to play. Meanwhile, Irene was preparing their sandwiches when Sherlock walked in. Everything alright? She asked and glanced at him over her shoulder, worried that Sherlock and Nero suddenly didnt get along. \nYou: ((did it go through now?))&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0126f7980c7e5059&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sherlock RP&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20170422033422&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You: hi \nStranger: hi \nYou:m orf \nStranger: f19 \nYou: m 18 here \nStranger: homy \nYou: you up to sext?

With a long powerful stroke the boar buries his member in you. \nYou: The smaller pigs venture closer and squeal at the commotion while a satisfied grunt bellows over your head \nYou: (if you wrote anything past that didnt get it) \nStranger: ( wrote:) \nStranger: shudder under the weight of the pig, and can feel its long corkscrew cock twitch inside me. \nYou: The huge mass of his form presses you further down into the muck as he begins rutting with quick shallow strokes. \nYou: The commotion seems to have attracted a little attention from what little you can tell, but you dont think youve been spotted just yet. \nStranger: grit my teeth as you begin to rut me, and can feel every coil of the screw scraping against my insides. Swamped by everything thats happening, feel pleasure start to creep into my thoughts as you get into a rhythm. \nYou: The tapered member squirms further toward your core with each stroke. The previously stoic beast is now becoming excited, his pace quickening. \nYou: The other denizens of the pen venture closer now, sniffing your pinned form without regard for modesty. \nStranger: can feel it worm its way deeper inside me, drilling its way through me. My own breathing starts to pick up, and cant help but let out a few moans, unable to deny the pleasure of the corkscrew drilling my deepest parts. \nYou: Again and again he pounds into you. The corkscrew, while dwarfed by the rest of his form, is massive in comparison to your battered backside, and continues to feed into you. \nYou: You feel the weight of his massive testes slap against your thighs, packed to the brim with virile seed. \nStranger: can feel it prodding against the very end of my walls, at the entrance to my innermost core. A string of drool starts to flow down my chin, my head just held above the mud, chumed up by the pigs vigorous actions. realise that my pussy is already damp, the corkscrew sliding in and out more easily now. \nYou: The pig watches your expression change, approving of your submission. He rears back and Tewards you with a mighty thrust, working the entirety of his length in to the hilt. You feel spurts of pre dripping into you, and obscene sloppy noises echo from your entrance. \nStranger: My eyes widen as feel the curled tip drill through my entrance into my fertile, virgin womb, every sensation heightened to unimaginable levels. moan loudly, unable to control myself, complemented by the wet, slapping sounds as the pigs cock slips in and out, and its body thrusts against my muddy ass and thighs, now also splattered with my own juices. \nYou: The inquisitive pigs all around you explore further, tugging and tearing at your already tattered and muddy dress. One bites the fabric barely concealing your breasts and pulls, and the clean pretty orbs pop our into the mud with a slop. \nYou: The great pig above you pays them no mind and continues his assault, driving you further and further into the goop. \nYou: By now you can barely make out the silhouette of a woman trying find see the source of the moans. \nYou: She is unable to until she crouches down, peering under the apparently very excited prize boar. \nYou: Then, your eyes meet. The woman is aghast, but covers her mouth to stifle her gasp. The moment seems to last forever. As she stares at your dominated body. \nStranger: look up at her as our eyes meet, my mouth open and tongue lolling and drooling. My clean breasts are being slopped through the filth beneath me, coating them in it. \nYou: For a moment, she seems about to call to alert someone, but stops as she realizes your pleasure. \nYou: Her face contorts between shock, confusion, and then, slowly something else. \nYou: A small smile creeps up the side of her mouth and a hand slips down between her legs. It is at this moment you realize help isnt coming. \nStranger: Realising this, seem to let go of any hope of getting out and lose my inhibitions. let myself be overcome by the pleasure, letting it flood through me. \nYou: The huge boar, ignorant of any of this picks up the pace, his cock now practically jetting pre into your deepest parts and back out, the excess dribbling down between your legs and mixing with the rest of the sludge. \nYou: Time slips away from you, the steady rhythm of his pounding numbs your mind and you are lost in yourself. \nYou: As you slip in and out of connection with the outside world you notice another bystander, then another, until a small crowd seems to be peering down at your depraved act. \nYou: Still none make a noise, none motion for help. You may as well be alone. \nStranger: The other pigs have removed almost all of my clothing, just the tattered remains of my panties hang around my hips. My moans have become louder and more visceral, reducing myself to a female wanting to be bred. \nYou: The pigs pace and circle, becoming frenzied at the prospect of a new unbred sow. \nYou: You can clearly discem the males among them, their narrow corkscrews bob beneath them with every movement. \nYou: Then, a bold pig approaches your front, licking your face and worming its way into your mouth with its sloppy tongue. \nStranger: Without hesitating, open my mouth for it, inviting it into my mouth and letting its tongue explore. \nYou: Two more approach your sides, sniffing and licking up your ribs before instinctively finding your breasts. They noisily lick and suckle each hanging tit like piglets. \nYou: The great boar holding you down pays them no heed, lost in the pleasure of breaking in something so tight. \nStranger: moan into the pigs mouth, our drool mixing together in my mouth and dripping from my lips. The mud, slop, and god knows what else has been chumed almost into a thick liquid, juices from my pussy dripping down into as a constant stream. \nYou: From all sides you debase yourself, nothing more than an animal now. \nYou: With a deep, swirling lick, the pig in front of you withdraws. In your animalistic state you can do little more but whine at the withdrawl of the pleasure giving flesh. \nYou: Luckily for you, it doesnt take long for something else of that pig to reach your lips. It bobs and drips, mixing with the drool smearing your pretty face. \nStranger: eagerly wrap my lips around the tip, sucking on it and pulling it further into my mouth. savour the taste of its precum, my tongue tracing the shape of the corkscrew. \nYou: You barely recognize the gasps and scattered cheer from what is now a fair sized crowd surrounding the pigsty. \nYou: from what little you can make out, they are pressing over the rails, intently watching the display and blocking out the vision of anyone outside \nYou: men and women caress themselves, aroused at this uncommon public display \nStranger: pay them no heed, completely engrossed in my own depravity, \nYou: As you work his slimy cock with your mouth, the pig before you squeals at a sensation he has never experienced and eagerly positions himself to mount your face. His member driven further down your throat as he does so. \nYou: The pigs to your sides get rougher, occasionally nipping their mouthfuls of tit-flesh and suckling hard on your tender nipples. \nYou: The original boar seems even more delighted in your further submission, slowing his hammering but increasing the force and depth with which he does so. He pants heavily at the exertion. \nStranger: deepthroat the pigs cock, wr \nStranger: (sorry) \nYou: (doing great :D) \nStranger: wrapping my tongue around the coils, sucking away at the slippery precum and mud on its cock. can feel the big boars cock well within my womb, prodding into the walls of my inner sanctum. \nYou: The pig to your front thrusts frantically, less powerful than the boar at your rear but certainly no less. energetic. \nYou: His also substantial balls slap wildly against your chin, smearing your face with the scent of the pigs crotch. \nYou: Audible moans now float from the crowd to your mind, and you smile dopily at the encouragement around a mouthful of pig meat. \nStranger: Im intoxicated by the smell of the pigs musk, the taste of the precum, and the overriding pleasure of the big boars corkscrew drilling me. dont know when started, but Im practically cumming constantly, my pussy flowing with juices \nYou: The boars head hangs beside your own, his panting ringing in your ears, drowning out all other noises save the slapping and squelching at your backside and the sucking and slurping of your mouth. \nYou: He quickens again, driving his tip into your deepest places again and again. His cock doubles around as it reaches the limit of your depths, stretching you from within. \nYou: His sack seems to tighten as it pounds your butt, the boars vocalizations signal that hes close to his limit. \nStranger: My pussy tightens and grips its cock, encouraging it to release its load in me, to breed me, \nYou: The boar is overcome with only one thought, to breed the sow below him, and his body follows suit. His cum comes in jets, pushing past all obstacles and flooding every comer of your fertile channel. \nYou: But the boar does not stop, he roars above you and keeps his pace, thrusting over and over in time with his spurts. \nYou: Excess cum squirts out from your depths with every motion, running down your legs, dripping from your crotch, and forming a puddle below you. \nYou: The boar before you squeals his loudest as well, as if triggered by the first, and blasts a load of his own tight down your gulping maw, bulging your cheeks and spraying from your nose. \nStranger: My pleasure plateaus as its hot, thick cum surges into me, filling every bit of me with gooey heat. \nYou: Neither shows any sign of stopping, sloppy cum flows around you and begins to fill the holes made by your hands and legs. \nYou: For a moment, reason springs back to your mind and a tinge of panic creeps in as you recall a pigs ejaculation can take nearly half an hour. But these thoughts are quickly pushed away by another hot blast of sticky pig cum. \nStranger: My eyes roll back into my head, overcome by the warmth spreading all throughout me. \nYou: Time is lost to you again, the applause of the crowd is met with deaf ears, nothing matters but the gooey heat spurting into you from both ends. \nYou: You form is spitroasted between a pair of beasts you up until now thought of as beneath you. You are marked by their scent, by their seed, and you now know your place. On your knees, stuffed with animal cum from both ends. \nYou: cock and cum* \nStranger: am visibly shuddering undemeath them in absolute pleasure, the mud rippling around me and splashing as my tits and thighs quiver. \nYou: As the boar above you slows, you are pressed as far as you can go into the slurry beneath you. Every inch of you is at this point coated with a thick mixture of cum and mud, and your own juices. \nYou: You dont know how long its been, the only thing to mark passing time is the slowing rhythmic spurts inside you and the occasional sputtering gasp for air. \nYou: A calmness and contentment washes over you, the enormous creatures above you not only pinning but also protecting you, shielding you from the outside world. Here, as an animal you are free from its stresses and complications. For once, life is simple. You swallow again. \nStranger: As the pig reaches the end of its load, can feel it start to fill me with its very thick, glue-ike cum at the end of its load, plugging up my pussy deep inside. \nYou: As the boars spurts slow, they become stickier, glue-like, sealing their copious juices inside your bloated frame. \nYou: And when the easily ten-times-your-weight male pulls out of you, only a small dribble leaks out instead of the veritable flood that would escape otherwise. \nYou: He tiredly dismounts, trots around to your still- plugged face, and gives you an approving lick on the cheek before he wades off. \nStranger: moan into the other pigs cock in a meek protest as it pulls out of me, my pussy twitching fervently and only dribbles of cum dripping out from me. \nYou: (how much longer you wanna go? Ive got half an hour and a couple more pigs if you want them.) \nStranger: (id be up for continuing if you are ;D) \nYou: (such stamina! lol) \nYou: With a parting thrust as deep as he can reach into your gullet, the pig mounting your face pulls out with a slorp. \nYou: You drool pig cum as a final spurt of ejaculate paints your face, and your bubbling pants come heavy at finally being allowed to breathe. \nYou: Thinking your ordeal over, you go limp. your face, tits, and all plant into the now mostly-cum puddle beneath you. \nYou: After a moment squirming and savoring the in the muck, you roll over only to discover a horde of more pigs around you, all with hard corkscrews and chuming balls swinging beneath them. \nStranger: pause and take the sight in for a while, my eyes drifting up past them to the form of the crowd around the sty, watching and anticipating what do next. Slowly and shakily, lift myself up, mud and cum tunning off of my body, and tum myself over back onto my front, standing on all fours as best can in the muck and presenting my pussy for the pigs. \nYou: A chorus of applause, cheers, and not a few moans flies from the crowd above you. \nYou: At this sight, the pigs descend upon you ina complete frenzy, each jostling for position. \nYou: They pile on top of you, on top of each other, frantically thrusting at any opening or point point of friction they can reach. \nYou: How many throbbing corkscrews are assaulting your form you couldnt count even without your now delirious and cum-addled mind. \nYou: The cum of the pigs before provides all the lubrication they need, one finding its way back into your pussy, two in your mouth and one intimidatingly thrusting around your still-virgin asshole. \nStranger: hungrily take the two in my mouth and swallow their cocks as far down my throat as theyll go. I let my front end fall down, slopping into the muck and teaching my arms to the side, groping around before grabbing a piggy cock in each hand. get to work sucking and jerking off the pig cocks, my ass and hips raised up into the air. \nYou: The thick, tapered member prodding at your ass finally hits home, burying itself with some effort between your plush cheeks. \nYou: The intrusion is harsh at first, but quickly becomes. incredible as your only unused hole is coated with goopy animal precum. \nYou: Pigs thrust at you from all angles, cocks in every orifice, every hand, and then some. The pigs and the crowd is ecstatic at your complete lack of resistance. \nYou: are* \nStranger: At the same time, Im in ecstasy, Im being violated and used by a mob of filthy pigs in a pool of thick, sloppy mud and cum and other filth. And Im loving every moment of it. \nYou: In their frenzied state, it doesnt take long at all for the first pig to orgasm. A juvenile male squeals and unleashes a torrential load into your cunt, thrusting all the while. \nYou: His arching spine barely makes room fora second pig to fill the gap and you cry out around your filthy mouthful as he stretches your already-filled pussy with a second cock. \nStranger: The young pigs cum hits the plug further in and surges back out, running from my pussy in torrents from around the two cocks \nYou: As before, the first pig sets off another, and the fat porker violating your hand shoots off, spraying your face and back with thick goopey ropes. \nYou: You shiver at the feeling of yet more cum being pumped into you and running down your spine, when more pigs use the added lubrication to thrust at your tits, mounting you and finding nothing but rubbing their dirty cocks all over your squished orbs all the same. \nYou: Before long, half of the pigs mounting your various parts are cumming. Completely dedicated to breeding, to owning their fresh sow, of making sure they use her complete submission to the fullest. \nYou: The crowd around you has lost all sense of decorum, men and women stroke themselves openly, their juices running down into the slurry that coats your obscene performance. \nStranger: My body is drenched in their hot cum, rolling off of me like waterfalls. Some of the gluey cum sticks to me, forming sticky clumps. Im hardly even doing anything any more, the pigs are all thrusting themselves against me themselves, my body is just being used by them \nYou: At last, the juveniles orgasm ends and he slips out satisfied. But no sooner does another pig take his place. This is only the beginning. \nYou: The sun rises high in the sky and begins to set, the market little more than an orgy by now. \nYou: Pig after pig cycles past you, delivering its load only to rest and then begin again. \nYou: Innumerable loads are inside you and around you. Your belly bulges, stuffed with nothing now but pig seed. \nYou: You reek of it, every hole you have drips it constantly, and all you can think of is more. \nStranger: My insides are stuffed with pig seed, numerous plugs lining my pussy, each holding back a chamber of hot pig seed \nYou: Two in each hole, three in each hole? Youve lost count, all you can do is tremblingly worship every cock jammed your way. \nYou: You fade in and out of consciousness, the comforting feeling of fullness and rocking thrusts sooth your mind. \nYou: You gulp down pig seed like water and squirm around every cock inside you, hungrily milking them for more piggy seed. \nYou: (still there?) \nStranger: (yeah, sorry, had to step away for a moment) \nYou: (all good, where do you want to go from here? feels like weve just about exhausted this premise) \nStranger: (hm, not really sure ;p) \nYou: (If you want to keep going we could let you become a fixture in the sty, as the town animal slut. Maybe even drag someone else in?) \nStranger: (Hm, interesting :D) \nYou: (Yes/no? Whats your timetable? :D) \nStranger: (Sure, can keep going ;:p) \nYou: (Yay) \nYou: (start us off on part 2?) \nYou: (actually could use a 5 min break) \nStranger: (thats alright) \nYou: (ok, ready when you are!) \nYou: (oh and kinks-wise, am hitting the mark? anything youd like to see more/less of?) \nStranger: It had been a month since was broken in by the pigs, and it was once again the day that the farmers market was set up in the town. All the usual stores were there, but in the pigsty all the pigs had been penned off at the far end. After last months display, it was decided that from now on in the market, would be included in the pigpen to put on another show. A crowd had already gathered early this moming to watch, and they cheered as made my way, naked, through the crowd. Once reached the fence, the people nearest it picked me up and just tossed me over the fence and straight into the mud. The boars on the other side started to squeal in excitement, itching to get at me. The crowd demanded the pigs be set loose, and the gate separating them from me was opened. \nStranger: (Yeah, Id say youre hitting them :o) \nYou: (ooh big start) \nYou: By now, their was no uncertainty in anyones mind about what was about to happen here. By the looks of it, the pigs definitely recognized you. \nYou: The crowd cheered as the hoard of boars rushed forward, each intent on being the first in a coveted spot inside their sow. \nYou: Somehow unsurpriseg, you notice that the muck is even deeper this time, the pigs keepers apparently saving up the grime and muck from the entire month just for you. \nStranger: get myself into position, all fours with my hips raised, eagerly anticipating the day ahead of me. hadnt been able to fuck the pigs again since the first time, and so Id been waiting all month for this, thought Id go crazy waiting. All this pent up lust, combined with the strong musk of the pigsty, means by pussy is already sopping wet and ready for them. \nYou: From the looks of it, the pigs feel the same way. They descend upon you cocks only just hardening but jostling for position all the same. \nYou: Normally they would follow a rough order, the smaller males allowing the larger boars to mount first. \nYou: However, in light of last month, none cared for hierarchy, much to the fury of one particular massive male. \nYou: Every time he tried to use his weight to push aside another of his kind, he was met with resistance by three others. \nYou: Failing to gain a spot and far to upset to wait his tum, the boars eyes fell upon something else. \nYou: A woman leaned just a bit too far over the railing, trying to get a good look at you inside the squirming mass of pig. \nYou: The huge boar eyed her hungrily. Perhaps this isnt the only breeding sow here. \nYou: you arent* \nYou: (would you like to play the second woman as. well?) \nStranger: (sure ;p) \nStranger: Some members of the crowd notice where the woman being eyed up by the big boar. Looks like he wants a piece of you! someone jeers, and the people around her start whooping. She barely has time to react as a number of people grab her legs and flip her up and over the fence, landing her in the mud too, much to the crowds delight. \nYou: The poor girl barely rights herself and looks up terrified. Up to her knees in mud and who knows what else, she staggers back at the huge males advance. To her dismay, the crowd only applauds louder. \nYou: Meanwhile, doing your best to work every pig cock around you out of its sheath, you recognize the girl as the very same that first saw you. The very one who didnt call for help. \nStranger: While Im sort of thankful of that now, cant help but feel this would be some nice comeuppance, especially since she started rubbing herself when she first saw me. dont bother to try and get up to help her, not that could anyway. My pussy is absolutely drenched in anticipation, the small boars are still too busy fighting for position that they still havent entered me. \nYou: And in an instant, the great male was upon the girl. Effortlessly bowling her over onto her back, he stood menacingly before her. \nYou: She closed her eyes, anticipating that the enormous animal would crush her. \nYou: A moment passed, she waited, and he never came. \nYou: Wrenching open her teary eyes, she stared up at the face of the boar right above hers. She could feel his gaze boring into her as she lie there dumbfounded. \nYou: It was only then that she realized. He was expectant. He wanted her to present herself. \nYou: He had already broken one sow by force. This one was going to beg. \nStranger: She stared back up the boar, running through every possibility in her head? Should she try to escape? Would they just throw her back in? What does. he want her to do? Then her mind went back to the time when she first saw me, and the look of sheer pleasure on my face, and started to have thoughts... \nYou: The crowd was now nearly silent, the tension in the air was palpable. \nYou: Then, quietly at first but rising in number with every repetition, they begin to chant. \nYou: Do it. Do it! DO IT! Yo e chant echoed off every comer of the pen and you could swear that once again, you could see that huge boar smiling \nStranger: As the chant grows, images of me being fucked fills her head, the moans made, how good must have felt. As if now in a trance, she slowly sits up in the mud, and begins undressing as the chant grows louder and faster. She tosses her clothes aside until she too is completely naked, then slowly and tentatively crouches down on all fours. The crows whoops and hollers in approval. \nYou: The boar bellows victoriously, and the crowd cheers with him. He takes his position on top of this new sow, and vigorously prods her rear entrances with his massive corkscrew. \nYou: The trembling girl winces and knows she must make a decision before it is made for her, which hole will she offer to this pig? \nYou: By now the others are hard at work on you, once more savoring the feeling of being completely stuffed by porcine prick. \nStranger: Occupied with the other pigs, can only just manage to keep tabs on the other woman, my mind already starting to cloud. After some thought, she tries to aim the boars cock at her pussy, raising her hips so they line up as close as she can. \nYou: After just a few more prods the boars head hits its mark in the poor girls pussy, and pressing his incredible weight forward, the beast drives his tapered cock in. Deeper it works in, growing wider with each inch. \nYou: The girl down on her hands and knees is positively dwarfed by the animal above her, and gasps. can be heard from the crowd followed by whistling and cheers. A show by both of the now-town-pig-sluts can at last begin. \nStranger: can tell that shes just been penetrated, and can just make out her form undemeath the massive boar. almost feel a small twinge of jealousy \nYou: Not to be forgotten, the pigs around you work vigorously, a full months worth of pent up desire from each being unleashed at once. \nYou: You are practically assaulted in their excitement, their cocks harder than youve ever felt before. \nYou: The huge male begins to powerfully jack-hammer into the girl, her wimpers are lost beneath the sloppy sucking of the mud and her pussy. \nYou: Once again, seeing his chance, a bold pig moves. up to fill the girls other unused end with stiff pig meat. \nStranger: She finds herself quickly overwhelmed, swamped by all these new sensations, and she cannot resist their advances. It seems that shes resigned to going with the flow. Meanwhile, Im quickly losing myself again to the pleasure of being gangbanged by a bunch of pigs \nYou: More and more pigs surround her as her will caves, all too eager to take advantage. One slips in her mouth, inching deeper little by litle. Another prods her forearm, the smart creature having leamed what a hand is capable of. \nYou: All the while the boar pummeling her pussy speeds up, apparently much more pent up this time than the last. \nYou: The eager pack of pigs atop you picks up their pace as well, all know that the first one to unload in a sow will be the most likely to give her piglets. \nStranger: press my hips back into them, encouraging them to release their load into me. The other woman is now also losing herself to the pleasure of the pig screw, and finds herself cumming on their cocks as they pound her. \nYou: The pigs are ecstatic, remembering just how eager you are for this. Their frantic thrusts push deep, twisting as far as they can into your deepest reaches, throbbing and squirming as they approach their limit. \nYou: The giant boar pressing down on the girlis no exception, and with a final few ragged thrusts that threaten to bury her in the greasy muck, his impossibly wide member begins to twitch and sputter. \nYou: Then, at once, the crowd is treated to two beautiful women being pumped utterly full by a pack of homy pigs. \nYou: They cascade one after another, thick hot globs of pig seed being unloaded into hungry mouths, cunts, and asses. \nStranger: relish in the feeling, as the hot pig cum fills me in every cranny and crevice inside me. The other woman is caught off guard by it and her eyes widen as hot pig seed is poured into her. \nYou: The pigs pay no heed to the girls inexperience, showing no mercy in their assault. The massive corkscrew buried in her pussy heaves, the brunt of an entire months worth of desire bubbling inside her. \nYou: In less than a minute she is stuffed with as much fluid as her poor pussy can hold and the excess spurts out of her drooling hole. \nYou: The pig using her face is less precise in his work. His cock popping wildly around her mouth, down her throat and all over her face as he cums. \nYou: Meanwhile your suitors oblige their willing sow and you find pigs of every size and weight pinning you and filling you full all at once. \nYou: Each is determined to be the one to make you mother his young.&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;017b8b6dce8c9081&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;pigmarket&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20170424025036&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You: do you have a gun? \nStranger: yes \nYou: can see it \nYou: ? \nStranger: opn camera \nYou: what \nStranger: open cam \nYou: is it closed? \nStranger: yes \nYou: assume you are not from america? \nYou: so you must have an AK-47? \nStranger: yes \nYou: LOL \nYou: are you into jihad? \nStranger:s \nYou: are you a radical jihadist \nStranger: what&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;017bdfe6525a5367&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20170904102556&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:57,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Stranger: Hi \nYou: hi \nStranger: Hows it going? \nYou: bad \nStranger: aw whats wrong? \nYou: well, its just been rough lately \nYou: not what i expected things would turn out like \nYou: my jobs awful and i make very little money \nYou: no chance for dating \nStranger: i am sorry that is hard :( \nYou: its like im always stuck in second gear \nYou: like it hasnt been my day or week or month, or even my year \nYou: but Your: ILL BE THERE FOR YOUUUUUUUUUUUU&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0180cd3fc15770de&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;advice&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20201107223425&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Stranger: Hey \nStranger: F17 \nYou: hi \nStranger: like older girls \nYou: f 23 Yo m :D Yo hy do like older girls ?

Who do you play? \nYou: Usually Canada, though Im flexible with others \nStranger: main Prussia (specifically nyo, but also do Gilbert and can switch between depending) \nYou: Works for me \nStranger: Any AUs youre fond of? \nYou: Its been a hot minute since Ive rped, so Im open to just about anything \nStranger: What a fat mood \nYou: Imao \nYou: anything you wanna be avoiding in the rp? \nStranger: Honestly like think we could burn that bridge when we get to it. Wbu? \nYou: sounds good \nStranger: Idk think recently Ive either been wanting something darker or the literary equivalent of wrapping me up in a blanket and giving me something to sob heavily into \nYou: feel that pretty hard \nStranger: Idk had a thing a few weeks ago where Gil was this figure skating star and like his girlfriend cheated on him, he broke up with her, and he went away with his brother to try and get away from her bc she just wont leave him tf alone \nStranger: could deffo see Matt meeting him on the ice and just being like wtf why does this guy looksosad \nYou: Im down for that if you want \nStranger: That way, we get the sad boi Gil trying to get over heartbreak while his ex still tries to get in touch with him \nStranger: And it could somehow get darker if we decide so \nYou: Yeah \nStranger: might even have a starter knocking around \nYou: You should check \nStranger: Nope, not one that fits. can just type up another \nYou: Thanks! \nStranger: This was the last straw. At last, Gilbert put his phone onto aeroplane mode after once again blocking yet another number she was trying to call him from. This wasnt fair! He had come to this rink in another country to get away from her once and for all, and she couldnt respect that he didnt want to hear from her. She had broken his trust, his heart, and drove him away. This trip with his brother was meant to calm him the fuck down, but it didnt help that his anxiety peaked every time she called him. No, this was his time. Gilbert was going to enjoy his time. With a deep breath, he put his headphones on and walked over on his little knife shoes to the ice. His time. At last, with the music on and very few people around at this early hour, he was able to skate how he wanted. There was no competition, no need for real technique. Instead, he just let his heart guide his feet. Those moves were pretty impressive understandable when you consider that he is, in fact, a professional figure skater. Ballet inspired and with such grace to a piece he had skated to for a long, long time. At last, his head was just empty. \nYou: Matthew hadnt gone beyond local competitions for his figure skating, but he was decidedly the best in his city, and that was partially because of how frequently he skated in the early hours of the morning. Whether it was indoors or outdoors, he always got a good skate in to keep his skills sharp. That being said, it threw him for a bit of a loop to not only see someone else, but a complete stranger already on the rink when he got there. He brushed off the surprise as he slid onto the ice, music low on his headphones for him to focus better on the moves. That effort was little use when the other mans moves were drawing his gaze, admiring the skill it took to pull them off so fluidly. \nStranger: Gilbert had barely even noticed the presence of someone else in the rink. Already, he was so engrossed in the music that he just kept moving and couldnt stop. It rose, climbing to a peak which finally replaced his anxiety and then... it stopped. From that amazing high came a reverberating silence and simultaneous foot stomp as his hands went up out of habit. His piece was over. Finally, he noticed the other man. Fuck, there was someone else here. In these ungodly hours, there was only the two of them in this whole place. Slowly, he removed his headphones to look at the other and offer an awkward smile. He had thought he would be alone for a little while, at least. Oh well. \nYou: Matthew had almost stopped his skating from how closely he was watching, offering up a smile when he saw the other finally acknowledge him. He skated over to him, stopping almost as smoothly as hed moved once he was in front of him. Sorry for intruding, but... that was beautiful. Its been a while since Ive gotten to watch someone else without a crowd or announcers. He looked over his face, trying to place a name to it but without success. Are you new around here? Im usually the only one here this early. \nStranger: Gilbert let his headphones hang around his neck while his hands slipped into his pockets to pause his music. It had been a while since he was able to just relax like this. Im just visiting for a couple of weeks to reset. Are you here every morning? That would definitely be commitment. In fact, it was probably the same amount of commitment he put in and this was his job! It seemed this guy didnt recognise him, so that was an added bonus. Maybe he would be able to skate in peace without someone fanning over him for the next few weeks. This whole trip was his escape. \nYou: Matthew nodded, giving him a smile. Yeah. practice in the mornings before starting the day. Its usually the only time have for it. He offered his hand, that gentle look still on his face. Im Matthew. Sorry again for interrupting you, you just looked so focused, it was hard not to watch. \nStranger: Gilbert looked at the hand for a moment before shaking it. God, this guy was cute. So gentle and honest looking... Gilbert. Dont worry about it, by the way. really didnt even notice you until was done. As bad as he felt, skating just put him in his own little world. Even his hand was soft, holy crap. He was just a soft guy! \nYou: Matthew gave his hand a small squeeze before letting go, brushing his bangs out of the way of his glasses. Im not hard to miss, dont blame you. He glanced over his face once more, noticing that somewhat sombre expression now that Gilbert wasnt wholly distracted by his skating. I should let you get back to skating. Dont think you came to talk to a stranger. \nStranger: Gilbert was honestly a bi mess. If he wasnt in such a horrible constant state of mind, he would probably want to talk to this guy more and get to know him. Matthew was cute and looked like he would be nice to get coffee with some time, but that wasnt what he was here for. He was here to calm down. He offered a small smile and reached for his headphones. Have a nice skate, Matthew. Ill try not to get in the way. With that, he pressed play and went right back to his skating. His heart pounded with a feeling he couldnt quite place. Whatever it was, he wasnt happy with it. \nYou: Matthew gave him a soft nod, moving to replace his own headphones. The same to you. He let his music pick back up, going to the other side of the rink to give Gilbert room. The music carried him off, though he couldnt help glancing towards the other man now and then to just admire his movements before focusing back on his own movements. It was nice to have another person in the rink with him, dancing separately but together. \nYou: (Is there somewhere we could move this to? have to go before too long \nStranger: ((Would email be chill?)) \nYou: (Yeah, totally \nStranger: ((Mine is iceflarepassiongmail.com)) \nYou: ((Sent u an email \nStranger: Gilbert finally left the rink for a drink of water after about half an hour. His head had calmed somewhat, but taking his phone off aeroplane mode made him grimace. As usual, his brother had sent him a text to let him know what he would be doing for the day in case Gilbert wanted to come along, but there were also several messages from an unknown Twitter account. His hands shook. No, no, she couldnt just leave him alone, could she? The messages were becoming threatening now. Hell, she was two seconds away from threatening to kill herself if he didnt talk to her. He couldnt do this. \nStranger: ((Got it!)) \nStranger: ((I sent the log over to you probs preemptively whoops)) \nYou: Matthew noticed when Gilbert left the rink, looking slightly concerned when he saw him shaking from just looking at him phone. Not his business, so he wasnt going to go interrupt. He just paid a bit more attention to the other man when he could, just to make sure he didnt need any immediate help. Maybe he should have gone to talk to him, but he already felt like hed done too much intruding for that. \nYou: ((Its alright. You wanna just reply on email? \nStranger: ((Could be a shout tbh)) \nYou: ((? \nStranger: ((Yeah no its a good idea, we should probs do that)) \nYou: ((alright. ill disconnect, you wanna send the rest of it with your reply? \nStranger: ((Can do!))&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;01901baa2bb325e6&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hetalia, anime&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20190202054045&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:64,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You: hai \nStranger: Hai \nYou: yuo woman \nStranger: No \nYou: i am men \nStranger: Yes \nYou: ok \nStranger: Mi name is manual \nYou: aa i am andres \nYou: african \nYou: you fron&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;019a2c38c13d280e&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20170802190303&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Stranger: hi \nYou: Hi \nStranger: hru \nYou: Welcome to Mc Donalds, may i take your order? \nStranger: hmmm \nStranger: want a milkshake \nYou: Ok \nYou: We are out of nomal milk \nStranger: oh \nYou: Is there a problem if we use donkey milk? \nStranger: what kind of mcdonalds is this \nStranger: oh yes \nStranger: love donkey milk \nYou: Okkk \nYou: Anything else? \nStranger: donkey milk makes me horny though \nStranger: hmm \nStranger: any recommendations? \nYou: Some crocodile nuggets \nStranger: oh yiz \nStranger: crocodile is so yummy \nYou: Ok \nStranger: ive never had nuggets though \nYou: Ok Yo lere is your food \nYou: Enjoy \nStranger: thank you \nStranger: arent you a little young to be working here? \nYou: 235)224) \nYou: am 42 young man \nStranger: yum yum h \nStranger: are you actually? \nYou: No \nStranger: Imao \nStranger: how old are you really? \nYou: am 18 \nStranger: oh nicee \nYou: Working yo pay my college \nYou: To* \nStranger: ahhh \nStranger: work to buy vbucks \nStranger: so can buy thick fortnite skins \nYou: Nicceee \nStranger: yup \nStranger: im gonna go to sleep \nStranger: byeeee \nYou: Ok \nStranger: good luck in college btw \nYou: Thanks \nStranger: cya \nYou: Come again \nYou: See ya&quot;},&quot;log_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;019ab66e745decd9&quot;},&quot;interests&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Minecraft&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;20210811001239&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:66,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Stranger: saw you with that man.

Stranger: Ive always wanted to go out to Cali 
You: Yeah its pretty cool here other then the racists homophobes and transphobes lol 
Stranger: those are everywhere 
Stranger: cant escape them 
You: Yeah but theres alot of trans murders here and queer hate crimes but maybe thats just bc theres so many ppl here 
Stranger: possibly 
Stranger: Im Dylan 
You: Nice name lol im nyx 
Stranger: Nyx?? 
You: Yeah 
Stranger: like the greek god 
You: Yeah 
Stranger: thats Awesome 
You: Yeah got a name change i didnt like my original lol didnt suit me

Stranger: if you dont mind me askin 
You: Im not gonna say that wouldnt ask anyone whos had a name change that lol but its fine 
Stranger: why not? its just a name 
You: Bc im trans and it makes me want to kill myself 
Stranger: oh 
Stranger: so you arent a legit female 
You: Yeah but ill let u keep talking to other ppl im lesbian anyway so wouldnt be with u lolbut good luck 
You: No am im just trandgender 
You: Being trans doesnt make you any less of a woman or the same for trans men 
Stranger: legit women have ovaries, a cervix, fallopian tubes 
Stranger: organs are what make people what they are 
You: No beacuse thats saying that trans men are woman and Afab enbys are woman 
You: Thats just sex im talking about gender 
You: Sex and gender are two very different things 
Stranger: gender is a social construct 
You: Yeah it is 
Stranger: itself is not real 
You: Yeah it isnt real so dont know why ppl make suck a big fukcing deal if someone is trans or non bianery or gender fluid 
Stranger: because you are born a certain way. nature intended you to be that. changing gender is not in our dna 
Stranger: animals only do it to equal out the gender imbalance in their enviroment 
You: Omfg im not gonna argue with you but please do some reaserch before saying dumb shit hommy 
You: You know science proves being trans is real 
Stranger: how 
You: Beacuse chromosomes have barley anything to do with it you know some people can have the opposite chromosomes 
You: And if you do brain tests it shows trans women have the same brain waves as a cis women same with trans men having the same brainwaves as cos men 
Stranger: there is xx and xy, and sometimes people are born as a hermaphradite 
You: And if you just saying that women are woman beacusr they can reproduce your excluding all the cis women who cany 
You: Yeah some men can have xx or xy same with women 
Stranger: but cis women who cant, cant because of a biological defect like cancer or endometriosis(which they can still have kids, just heavily advised against) 
You: And saying people are only there gender based on genitals is just like saying women are walking vaginas yknow like a misogynist 
Stranger: no, because men are only men because of their organs, its a two way street, but your liberal, so of course youd only decide to include one side of an opinion 
You: hope you dont find a gf lol all of this your saying is bullshit go read a book about advanced science or some shit you dont get it Ive spent a year learning this shit 
You: You know that there are conservative trans ppl right? 
Stranger: very few</span></div></div>

You: know what you said. just wanted to piss you off. -Liam (Alpha, 19) 
Stranger: My parents have a house party! Im supposed to be pretty. -N 
You: And the hickeys dont make you pretty? Thats insulting. -L 
Stranger: Insulting to you? Give me a break. -N 
You: Ill give you a break when you can actually stand one without crawling back to me. -L 
Stranger: Shut up. -N 
You: You wanna make me? -L 
Stranger: Hmph. Come over. -N 
You: ...Really? Anything could happen when come over. -L 
Stranger: Whats that supposed to me. -N 
Stranger: *mean?

Stranger: The latter. -N 
You: Fucking try me. Be there in 20. -L 
Stranger: Good. -N 
You: Liam doesnt wait to check his parking when he storms the place. Come meet me -L he sends when he exits his car into the driveway in search of the Omega. 
Stranger: Nico glanced to his phone, smiling to himself. He was still contemplating how much he wanted to tease the other before letting the Alpha fuck him again. If he ever did. The blond walked out, pushing up his glasses. You could have met me inside and let me put contacts in, asshole. 
You: I know the routine, Liam smirks and pretends to shrug nonchalantly. I just wanted to break it to annoy you, cause its just too easy. Have anything to say? 
Stranger: He growled a little, standing on his tiptoes so he could grab the others collar. Shut. Up. He crashed their lips together, eyes closed. 
You: His instincts pick up immediately, and he grips the other boys wrist in one hand and his hip in the other. He answered the kiss fiercely and still made time to leave a bite on Nicos bottom lip. 
Stranger: He moans softly, melting as the other takes control. Even if they fought, and were wrong for each other, there was no denying how good it felt. By the time Nico pulled away his lenses had fogged up. 
You: Looks like still win, Liam smirks, hands still tight around Nicos hip and hand. It was too satisfying to know he could get away with what he knew was wrong. Now get to choose what to do with this sore loser. 
Stranger: Though his face was contorted to seem tough, the Omega couldnt help his little whimper as he stared up. Maybe this time he wouldnt be getting his way. Please, he mumbled, rolling his eyes. 
You: Look as disappointed as you want. You still smell like you need a thick knot in you, he growled, licking his lips. And Im more than happy to provide. And if it makes you feel better, Ill let you choose between your room or my car. 
Stranger: Nico hadnt even noticed how much slick had soaked his panties, his pale skin blushing at the thought. The car. Hed managed through the words without completely stumbling, though his hands clung onto the Alpha desperately. 
You: Still desperate to just surround yourself in my scent even thought Im not even an inch in front of you. Greedy little bitch, he chuckled, gripping the Omega by the shirt and opening the cars backseat to shove him inside and later follow suit. 
Stranger: He scrambled in, overwhelmed by the Alpha. He was quick to undress, not caring if it made him look even more submissive. He was hot and horny, making sure his backside faced Liam for quite a bit of time. 
You: Liam made short work of stripping himself of his shirt and shoving his pants down. Fuck, youre so fucking wet, he breathed, reveling in the scent and feeling his cock harden. Always so horny. What am to do with you? he mock- sighed, tracing the other boys hairline before grabbing a fistful and tugging. 
Stranger: Uh! He gasped when the other pulled at his curls. Nicos back arched, fully at the olders disposal. F- Fuck me, obviously, he grubted. 
You: Youre insufferable. Still giving me attitude when youre at my mercy, he growled, leaning down and clamping his teeth over the Omegas neck and sucking hard. At the same time he used his free hand to navigate the boys body and thrust into his still-leaking entrance. 
Stranger: He didnt have time to object, busy with the others finger working his needy hole. Oh! More! he begged. 
You: He hummed against his skin, shaking his head and finding a new spot to suck a hickey into. dont think so. Im still having fun watching you squirm and beg. 
Stranger: Nico was practically shaking, jolting in pleasure every now and then. His moans were needy, filling the car with squeaks a jumbled nonsense. The Omega was so lusty, wondering what it would feel like to really be marked. Slick trickled out of him, the boy moving to rub his small cock. 
You: Not tonight, baby, he grunted, letting go of the Omegas hair to grab his wrist as he reached for his cock. Liam found the boys other hand and pinned them both over his head as he continued to finger and play with his slick-wet hole. The only way youre gonna cum is from my knot. Any second opinion, my little bitch? 
Stranger: He mewled and rocked for awhile, desperate for friction. Still, the boy settled, finally murmuring. No Sir, he squeaked, voice smaller and high pitched. 
You: Liam smirked in his triumph, actually beginning to stretch Nicos hole to prepare him for his cock. Good boy. Im gonna fill you up in just a sec, alright? 
Stranger: He nodded, getting more and more restless. Yes, god yes he sighed, his plump ass bouncing as he was stretched. Nico didnt even care how much he was surrendering. He needed an Alpha knot. 
You: Good boy, he repeated, almost getting lost as he watched Nicos response to him fingering him open. This is mine, and Im gonna fucking knot it, he breathed, positioning himself over the Omega and lining his cock up with his ass, then roughly pushing himself in with a low groan. 
Stranger: The Omegas mouth fell open, head tilted back. Fuck! he cried, hips desperate to get into the fastest rhythm possible. Oh, Sir You feel so good, so big 
You: You like that? he chuckled breathlessly, leaning back down to claim the boys neck with his teeth as he experimented with the different times he would thrust his hips. God, youre so fucking wet. could fuck you for hours.. 
Stranger: He nodded eagerly, whimpering and longing for Liams knot. His slicked-up hole took the males cock easily, and to Nico the sting felt too good to go slow. Please, please go harder! 
You: You little whore, he grunted, muscles straining as he adjusted himself to properly fuck the Omega underneath him. He was getting more forceful with his thrusts, filling his hole to the full hilt of his cock. My pretty Omega bitch. 
Stranger: He smiled, biting his lip in pleasure and trying not to scream out. Please, please knot me. Fill me up, need cum, he pleaded. 
You: Liam panted, quickening his pace and tightening his grip on the boys hips. He bit his lip as he fucked more deeply into the Omega, before cumming long and hard with a low groan. His knot was large, stretching the hole out even further while Liam simply watched his own cum leaking out along with the spilled slick. 
Stranger: Nico gave one last moan, feeling himself climax as the other came inside him. He panted, laying back and pushing up his glasses. 
You: It took a minute of calming down to feel his knot still throbbing inside Nico, and he pulled the boys thighs apart to settle more comfortably on the car seat. Looks like well be here for a while, Liam said after gaining his breath. He reached over and touched the Omegas little cock, giving it a stroke or two to see his reaction. 
Stranger: The stimulation made him jump, gulping. Dude! What the hell, he huffed, wiping the sweat off his forehead. 
You: Wouldve been more fun if you were on your heat like last time, he huffed himself, brushing his sweat-dampened hair back with his fingers. 
Stranger: Well you got me knocked up that time and had to get an abortion so 
Stranger: *sorry!! 
Stranger: Well you got me knocked up that time and had to get an abortion so, he mumbled, though he never told Liam about that. 
You: Oh NP! 
You: Liam stayed quiet for a moment, trying to register if hed ever been given this information beforehand. Youre not kidding, are you? though youd taken pills or something when we did that. 
Stranger: I did, but you knotted me when was in heat. He looked away from the other. 
You: You said didnt have to pull out! he defended, then again falling silent. Did you plan on telling any this to me til now? 
Stranger: I dont know. He crossed his arms, looking up. Why do you care? 
You: I knocked you up? he said, quietly but with clear incredulity. I bred you and think thats enough for me to give a shit about. couldnt at least have been there when you aborted? 
Stranger: I dont need you, okay? Its fine, less of a burden to you. He closed his eyes, thinking for a moment. He was silent for quite some time. Im sorry, okay? 
You: He was frowning, but it was obscured by the dark, and difficult angle. Yeah, whatever, Just...tell me next time something like that happens, he sighed, sliding his hand along Nicos thigh. wanna at least be partly responsible for the things we do. 
Stranger: Nico tried not to overthink the we part, staring up at the other and trying to place Liams feelings. Right. Well um. 
You: Dont think about it too hard. get it. You dont need me, and this is just sex to take the edge off your horny Omega tendencies. Liam leaned back against the car window, a hand over his lower stomach where he could still feel his knot pulsing.</span></div></div>

You: christian? 
Stranger: yes 
You: The Hebrew Bible contains several references, both in Mosaic law as well as in its narrative portions, to acts that would be considered rape in the modern world.1 Hebrew lacks a legal or technical term for rape, since in Biblical times, a sexual assault against another mans daughter, wife, or betrothed could only be a theft of that mans sexual property, rather than an offense against the woman herself.2 
You: explain this 
Stranger: mosaic laws are superceeded by the new testament 
You: lol! 
You: did jesus sayd that? 
You: hello? 
Stranger: its pretty basic doctrine, yeah. its the same reason we cont eat kosher and can work on the sabbath and stuff 
You: show me 
You: and why we can do that 
You: show me the verse 
You: where jesus sayd that it super... it Yo an you hurry im recording Yo hat you even type in 
You: theres nothin to defend 
You: the old law still counts 
Stranger: it takes time lol, relax. if ur in sucha hurry then google it, this is super basic theology dude 
You: no 
You: it doesnt 
You: its simple 
You: the old law counts Yo oure just maybe no christian

You: For sending him away. IA 
Stranger: He would have still payed you, Irene. SH

Stranger: Fair enough. SH 
Stranger: Who would your ideal client be? SH

Stranger: Then what do you like? SH 
You: Cant you deduce that yourself? IA 
Stranger: Sex really isnt my field. SH 
You: So? It doesnt have to be when you observe. IA 
Stranger: meant if you were one on one and serious with another person, what would like? Would you still have to be dominant figure? Would you like rough and tumble? SH 
You: Equality. Id like to be his or her equal. dont have to be dominant but could never be submissive. Give and take equally. IA 
Stranger: That, in my experience is the healthiest position for a couple. SH 
You: You have relationship experience? IA 
Stranger: From my line of work. SH

Stranger: sure 
You: Which ship? 
Stranger: science? 
You: Sure sounds good. Who do you play? 
Stranger: Bruce. 
You: Sounds good. Ive got some prompts. One is based specifically for science bros but its a HS AU, the others are canon based but theyre more generic 
Stranger: Either one is fine with me. :) 
You: Well Ill grab the au but if you feel like something different let me know. 
Stranger: cool 
You: (High school AU, but some of the events of the MCU happen, like Bruce being the Hulk but just younger, Tonys parents dying, and if we make this long term, becoming Ironman. was thinking established, but like just barely. They admitted that they liked each other, probably kissed, but their relationship isnt very developed.) It was weekends like this that he really enjoyed his dads job. It had put Howard and Maria Stark far away from their home ina time zone which meant theyd be too asleep to bother Tony while half the school ran drunk through the mansions hallways. He had no idea that the trip had already ended for his parents, that they were lying dead in a wrecked car and that any fun he had at the party would be ruined by one phone call in the morning. Instead, he grinned widely as he walked through the crowded rooms ina large Christmas sweater, pushing past his guests to get to the door after getting the text that Bruce had finally gotten there, after a lot of convincing just to get him to show up. He already had a drink in his hand to offer his boyfriend and a few too many in his system to think about whether this was a good idea or not 
Stranger: Bruce wasnt too into parties, but hed gotten a little more used it with Tony. He wore a second hand green sweater with some snowflakes stitched into it. He made his way into the mansion, still in awe of how huge it was. When he finally saw Tony, a bit of relief washed over him and he came over to greet him with a light kiss. Hey. Youre not too drunk already, are you? he asked, a little concerned, though he took a sip from the drink Tony offered him. More people than expected... 
You: In the end, Tony had been thoroughly impressed with himself when he got Bruce to come at all, and dressed for the occasion no less. There you are. Tony grinned when the other found him, slipping an arm around Bruces waist to lean into the quick kiss. ...Im not Atoo/ drunk. Tony rolled his eyes, leading his boyfriend through the crowd of people. Despite the front room being enormous, it was still tightly packed. Well the whole school came...just about, anyway, Its finally Christmas vacation. Everyone wants to party before they have to go do things with their family for the holiday. 
Stranger: Yeah, but Id be just as fine without the... audience, Bruce mumbled, staying close to Tonys side. This was still a lot for him to take in, but with Tony it was easier. When they got to a place where it wasnt as crowded, he let outa long breath. So...Are you still going away with your parents for Christmas? Or do you think you could stay? he asked softly, taking Tonys hand to hold. Not that you cant go with them. Just... Id love to see you if we got the chance. 
You: Audience? Theyre only staring because theyre wondering how an asshole like me got such a cute date. Dont mind them. Tony was half right, they were staring because of him, because of his reputation of losing partners as fast as he could get them, wondering how long this one could last. My parents wont be home until after New Years, so, Im all yours for Christmas if you dont mind me being so clingy. Tony smiled at him, intertwining their fingers. 
Stranger: All mine, hm? Bruce smiled and leaned ina little closer. might be spending a lot of time here then, he hummed. Taking another long sip from his glass, Bruce shook his head a little. dont know how got lucky enough to be with a guy like you. Didnt think youd ever notice me, really. 
You: Id like that...you could help me put up the tree. We always saved it until Christmas Eve, just a tradition...of course, usually, the tradition would be for my parents to be around on Christmas. Tony shook his head, trying not to sound bitter. You could pack a bag and stay, even. A vacation away from that house. Tony knew Bruce didnt like talking about his home life, but Tony couldnt stand the thought of him in there. Of course noticed you, you were my best friend, it just took me too long to actually do something about it. 
Stranger: Better late than never, Bruce teased softly. Id love to stay here. The perfect vacation. He nuzzled Tonys cheek lightly, pressing a light kiss to his skin. It was nice to have a safe space, where he didnt have to worry. Well have the best Christmas ever. No parents, just us. Whatever we want all day. Maybe you could even take us on a day trip to pick out a tree. 
You: Tony smiled wider when Bruce agreed, curling his arms around his waist and hooking his fingers under the green sweater. That sounds perfect. Tony had to pause for a series of excited shrieking, which either came from the change in music or someone finding another liquor cabinet. -do you think a tree would fit on the back of my convertible? Tony laughed, leading Bruce a little further off from the crowd. 
Stranger: Bruce laughed and shook his head. I guess not, he said, absently leaning into the little touches. We could get a smaller one though, just for us. Or rent something bigger, he said. Maybe... maybe just stay here and relax for a while. Enjoy having this place all to ourselves. 
You: Ill take us out to this place upstate, we can pick one out and theyll deliver it...they dont have very many small ones, though. Tony closed his eyes as he leaned in, pressing his lips towards Bruces neck. Well have weeks all to our own. 
Stranger: Bruce tilted his head back to give Tony more space, humming happily. Sounds perfect, he sighed, relaxing in Tonys arms. Tony... Tony, come on. We still- theres people, he mumbled, grinning to himself. 
You: While the words might have sounded like he was complaining, Tony could practically hear the grin in Bruces voice, and the way he tilted his head back encouraged Tony to press in closer, trailing his lips up the soft skin of Bruces neck, gently giving it a little nip. What? Do you want me to stop? Tony murmured, speaking against his skin. 
Stranger: Ah- just... no, Bruce admitted, closing his eyes. He made a soft, pleased sound and wrapped his arms over Tonys shoulders. Maybe just... find someplace more private? he mumbled. 
You: Tony glanced up from the others neck, warm breath sweeping across his skin. There were definitely people watching them now. Of course, he knew the private places, every inch of the house, but itd be more fun to let Bruce find one. Ill follow you. Tony nodded for him to lead the way, before returning his lips to Bruces neck like they were pulled by a magnet 
Stranger: Bruce couldnt help a happy sigh when he felt Tonys lips on him again, smiling despite himself. The attention wasnt so terrible, but he was already blushing like mad. He took Tonys hand and slipped down the hall, trying to remember which ones would be a good spot to hide away. He opened the door to the study and pulled Tony inside with him. Is this one okay? he whispered. 
You: Tony glanced up when he heard the handle of a door turning, and felt Bruce tug him inside. Its perfect. Tony murmured back, and this time led Bruce, to a soft leather couch in the center of the study. Bruce had picked one of his favorite rooms. Tony sat them down, one hand curled over Bruce as he leaned in again, sucking slowly on the skin of his neck. ...this is okay, right? Tony mumbled, wanting Bruce to be comfortable. 
Stranger: Yeah. More than okay, Bruce sighed, sinking back into the couch while Tony leaned in. , Whatever you want. Ill tell you if its too much, he promised, reaching up to stroke his fingers through Tonys hair. 
You: Tony nodded at the reassurance, going back to soft kisses for a moment. He couldnt help the quiet little breath of enjoyment when he felt fingers in his hair, biting down slowly on Bruces neck with the promise Bruce wouldnt let him take it too far. 
Stranger: Ah- Bruce moaned, his breath hitching a little when Tony started to get a little rougher. He held onto him tighter, fingers gripping at the sweater. Tony... 
You: The moan in his ear was perfect, and it only pushed him to latch on to the spot he bit, intent on leaving at least some kind of mark. Tony curled his arms further around Bruces waist, shifting to his knees to lean over him. 
Stranger: Bruce was left breathless, not bothering to stay too quiet since they were in the room alone. He cupped the back of Tonys head, playing with his hair and gently pressing him, encouraging more. Hed definitely have some marks left, and just the thought brought another pleased sound from his throat. 
You: God, every sound he drew out from Bruce was incredible, and he just wanted to hear more. Tony curved one knee over Bruces thighs until he was positioned over his lap, having to pause and catch his breath, running his tongue over the fresh mark. ...-fuck. He said breathlessly, shaking his head. -youre perfect. 
Stranger: Bruce wrapped an arm around Tonys waist to pull him closer. Ah... thats gonna last a while, he mumbled, smiling. You, uh... want me to do it for you too? he asked, not too sure how this worked, not having much relationship experience at all. 
You: Tony couldnt help but chuckle a little at the offer, pressing his forehead into Bruces shoulder and looking up at him. The others uncertainty, the little nervousness about what to do, it was adorable. You dont have to. Tony assured him, before adding. ...but Id love it. My neck is my absolute weak spot. 
Stranger: Yeah? Good to know that, Bruce smiled bashfully, turning his head to kiss the side of Tonys head. Id like to try that. And Im not near perfect, he added. 
You: Go ahead then. Tony hummed as he leaned towards the kiss against his head. Everything in the moment with Bruce felt absolutely perfect. Of course you are. Tony mumbled back. I said so. 
Stranger: Just because you say something doesnt make it true automatically, Bruce smiled, slipping his hand under the edge of Tonys sweater. He shifted just a little to nuzzle and kiss at Tonys neck, starting small. 
You: ...hm, that doesnt sound right to me. Tony grinned faintly, leaning towards the hand that brushed under his sweater and closing his eyes again, head tilting to tbe side to give Bruce room. He chewed on his lip, breathing in a little sharper at the first few kisses. 
Stranger: Bruce smiled against Tonys skin, nipping lightly along Tonys jaw up to a spot just under his ear where he nipped a little harder, sucking more. He paid attention to how Tony reacted, not wanting to hurt him. 
You: Tony hadnt been sure if Bruce would know what he was doing, but it definitely felt like he did. Tony tensed at the bite, his body shivering and his hands tightening their grip on Bruce, a moan slipping through his lips as Bruce sucked more, 
Stranger: Bruce closed his eyes, humming against Tonys skin while he sucked over the mark. The sounds he made were beautiful to Bruce, reminding him that this was real, they were together and it wasnt some kind of joke. I could get used to this, he whispered, nipping lightly at his earlobe. 
You: Tony chuckled a little, laying his head back. It was almost a shame his only plans were with Bruce and he wouldnt get to show the mark off to anyone. ...so could I. Tony breathed in response, groaning a little. Youre...good at this. 
Stranger: Bruce grinned, pulling back to kiss Tony gently on the lips. Am I? Im just trying to do like what you did, he smiled, lightly tracing his fingers along Tonys lower back. 
You: Tony closed his eyes again as he pressed back into Bruces lips, grinning back at him. .well youre a quick learner then, fuck. 
Stranger: Bruce smiled and kissed him back happily. Youre a good teacher, what can say? he hummed, using his free hand to cup Tonys cheek. Can tell you something kinda embarrassing? he asked softly. I... remember our first date? And that- you kissed me when you took me back home. That was my first kiss, he admitted. 
You: ((Be right back sorry!)) 
Stranger: actually its getting pretty late for me here. do you wanna continue in email or something? 
Stranger: my email is still. .brucebannergmail.com if you want. thanks for the rp, even if you dont want to. J</span></div></div>

Why are you here? IA (Before Nero was bom, they agreed that their son would be safer away from London ) 
Stranger: ((We roleplayed yesterday and my phone messed up!)) 
You: ((oh we did? :D and mine does that too it sucks )) 
Stranger: Sherlock sat with his legs both side of the young boy as he finished the beautiful tower there you go, Nero. He couldnt help but smile slightly knock it down. He looked at Irene this simple activity allows Nero to understand cause and effect and the irreversibility of damaging without the input of work. 
Stranger: ((Yeah it was the one based in the fourth season.)) 
You: ((oh i remember now! thanks :) )) 
You: Nero stood up and glanced at his parents again before he knocked the tower down once more, starting to giggle again. He was smart for his age, though he still didnt understand what his father meant. Again, again. He said happily and clasped his hands together as he bounced up and down in front of his father. 
Stranger: He couldnt help but smile at the childs excitement. Okay, sit back down please. He smiled and started building again, finally feeling at peace fora long time. 
Stranger: for the first time in a long Gomez 
Stranger: *time. 
You: Irene smirked as she watched the two and see how happy both seemed, though Nero seemed happier. He nodded and sat back down as he helped his father build another tower. Maybe it wasnt a bad idea to tell Sherlock to just come by. 
Stranger: He smiled and built another beautiful tower. He watched Nero happily, rubbing the little boys back gently, he leamt that helped children when he was Teading up on them. 
You: Instead of just one tower, Nero wanted to build another one so they could both knock down a tower. Irene ruffled her sons curls and got up when she was sure that the two of them got along. Are you hungry? can make us a snack. She offered them both and Nero nodded. I want a sandwich please. He said politely with a large grin on his face. 
Stranger: Sherlock smiled and knocked down the tower with his son Im fine thank you. He used his manners for once to encourage his son to, although he never usually would. 
You: Alright. She smiled at the two and went into the kitchen to make Nero and herself a sandwich. Are you going to stay? Nero asked him quietly as he started to build a house now with the bricks. 
Stranger: ((How old is Nero?)) 
You: ( was thinking maybe 3? What do you think? ) 
Stranger: (Thats perfect!) 
You: ((okay :))) 
Stranger: He shrugged I have to go back to work soon... he admitted. He still had to sort out all this Moriaty stuff and protect John. 
You: Okay... he mumbled and look down before he continued to build the little house he was making. 
Stranger: He sighed slightly and got up I should go and help mummy. He walked to the kitchen and sat down, thinking quietly. 
You: Nero just nodded and quietly continued to play. Meanwhile, Irene was preparing their sandwiches when Sherlock walked in. Everything alright? She asked and glanced at him over her shoulder, worried that Sherlock and Nero suddenly didnt get along. 
Stranger: ((Hello?)) 
You: ((sorry i think mine didnt send!)) 
You: Nero just nodded and quietly continued to play. Meanwhile, Irene was preparing their sandwiches when Sherlock walked in. Everything alright? She asked and glanced at him over her shoulder, worried that Sherlock and Nero suddenly didnt get along. 
You: ((did it go through now?))</span></div></div>

Stranger: hey sorry about this but ive got to take care of something thats came up, so ill have to come back in a bit 
Stranger: shouldnt be gone for too long though 
You: no worries, how long you thinking? 
Stranger: at least 10 minutes, maybe more. 
You: all good, Ill be here 
Stranger: alright, thanks again :) 
Stranger: right, sorry, that take much much longer than exptect . 
You: welcome back! Yo st a little longer haha 
You: so, ready to get back to it? 
Stranger: absolutely ;D 
You: great, got a keyboard now so writing should be easier 
You: alright, last thing saw before the connection dropped: 
You: It happens. With a long powerful stroke the boar buries his member in you. 
You: The smaller pigs venture closer and squeal at the commotion while a satisfied grunt bellows over your head 
You: (if you wrote anything past that didnt get it) 
Stranger: ( wrote:) 
Stranger: shudder under the weight of the pig, and can feel its long corkscrew cock twitch inside me. 
You: The huge mass of his form presses you further down into the muck as he begins rutting with quick shallow strokes. 
You: The commotion seems to have attracted a little attention from what little you can tell, but you dont think youve been spotted just yet. 
Stranger: grit my teeth as you begin to rut me, and can feel every coil of the screw scraping against my insides. Swamped by everything thats happening, feel pleasure start to creep into my thoughts as you get into a rhythm. 
You: The tapered member squirms further toward your core with each stroke. The previously stoic beast is now becoming excited, his pace quickening. 
You: The other denizens of the pen venture closer now, sniffing your pinned form without regard for modesty. 
Stranger: can feel it worm its way deeper inside me, drilling its way through me. My own breathing starts to pick up, and cant help but let out a few moans, unable to deny the pleasure of the corkscrew drilling my deepest parts. 
You: Again and again he pounds into you. The corkscrew, while dwarfed by the rest of his form, is massive in comparison to your battered backside, and continues to feed into you. 
You: You feel the weight of his massive testes slap against your thighs, packed to the brim with virile seed. 
Stranger: can feel it prodding against the very end of my walls, at the entrance to my innermost core. A string of drool starts to flow down my chin, my head just held above the mud, chumed up by the pigs vigorous actions. realise that my pussy is already damp, the corkscrew sliding in and out more easily now. 
You: The pig watches your expression change, approving of your submission. He rears back and Tewards you with a mighty thrust, working the entirety of his length in to the hilt. You feel spurts of pre dripping into you, and obscene sloppy noises echo from your entrance. 
Stranger: My eyes widen as feel the curled tip drill through my entrance into my fertile, virgin womb, every sensation heightened to unimaginable levels. moan loudly, unable to control myself, complemented by the wet, slapping sounds as the pigs cock slips in and out, and its body thrusts against my muddy ass and thighs, now also splattered with my own juices. 
You: The inquisitive pigs all around you explore further, tugging and tearing at your already tattered and muddy dress. One bites the fabric barely concealing your breasts and pulls, and the clean pretty orbs pop our into the mud with a slop. 
You: The great pig above you pays them no mind and continues his assault, driving you further and further into the goop. 
You: By now you can barely make out the silhouette of a woman trying find see the source of the moans. 
You: She is unable to until she crouches down, peering under the apparently very excited prize boar. 
You: Then, your eyes meet. The woman is aghast, but covers her mouth to stifle her gasp. The moment seems to last forever. As she stares at your dominated body. 
Stranger: look up at her as our eyes meet, my mouth open and tongue lolling and drooling. My clean breasts are being slopped through the filth beneath me, coating them in it. 
You: For a moment, she seems about to call to alert someone, but stops as she realizes your pleasure. 
You: Her face contorts between shock, confusion, and then, slowly something else. 
You: A small smile creeps up the side of her mouth and a hand slips down between her legs. It is at this moment you realize help isnt coming. 
Stranger: Realising this, seem to let go of any hope of getting out and lose my inhibitions. let myself be overcome by the pleasure, letting it flood through me. 
You: The huge boar, ignorant of any of this picks up the pace, his cock now practically jetting pre into your deepest parts and back out, the excess dribbling down between your legs and mixing with the rest of the sludge. 
You: Time slips away from you, the steady rhythm of his pounding numbs your mind and you are lost in yourself. 
You: As you slip in and out of connection with the outside world you notice another bystander, then another, until a small crowd seems to be peering down at your depraved act. 
You: Still none make a noise, none motion for help. You may as well be alone. 
Stranger: The other pigs have removed almost all of my clothing, just the tattered remains of my panties hang around my hips. My moans have become louder and more visceral, reducing myself to a female wanting to be bred. 
You: The pigs pace and circle, becoming frenzied at the prospect of a new unbred sow. 
You: You can clearly discem the males among them, their narrow corkscrews bob beneath them with every movement. 
You: Then, a bold pig approaches your front, licking your face and worming its way into your mouth with its sloppy tongue. 
Stranger: Without hesitating, open my mouth for it, inviting it into my mouth and letting its tongue explore. 
You: Two more approach your sides, sniffing and licking up your ribs before instinctively finding your breasts. They noisily lick and suckle each hanging tit like piglets. 
You: The great boar holding you down pays them no heed, lost in the pleasure of breaking in something so tight. 
Stranger: moan into the pigs mouth, our drool mixing together in my mouth and dripping from my lips. The mud, slop, and god knows what else has been chumed almost into a thick liquid, juices from my pussy dripping down into as a constant stream. 
You: From all sides you debase yourself, nothing more than an animal now. 
You: With a deep, swirling lick, the pig in front of you withdraws. In your animalistic state you can do little more but whine at the withdrawl of the pleasure giving flesh. 
You: Luckily for you, it doesnt take long for something else of that pig to reach your lips. It bobs and drips, mixing with the drool smearing your pretty face. 
Stranger: eagerly wrap my lips around the tip, sucking on it and pulling it further into my mouth. savour the taste of its precum, my tongue tracing the shape of the corkscrew. 
You: You barely recognize the gasps and scattered cheer from what is now a fair sized crowd surrounding the pigsty. 
You: from what little you can make out, they are pressing over the rails, intently watching the display and blocking out the vision of anyone outside 
You: men and women caress themselves, aroused at this uncommon public display 
Stranger: pay them no heed, completely engrossed in my own depravity, 
You: As you work his slimy cock with your mouth, the pig before you squeals at a sensation he has never experienced and eagerly positions himself to mount your face. His member driven further down your throat as he does so. 
You: The pigs to your sides get rougher, occasionally nipping their mouthfuls of tit-flesh and suckling hard on your tender nipples. 
You: The original boar seems even more delighted in your further submission, slowing his hammering but increasing the force and depth with which he does so. He pants heavily at the exertion. 
Stranger: deepthroat the pigs cock, wr 
Stranger: (sorry) 
You: (doing great :D) 
Stranger: wrapping my tongue around the coils, sucking away at the slippery precum and mud on its cock. can feel the big boars cock well within my womb, prodding into the walls of my inner sanctum. 
You: The pig to your front thrusts frantically, less powerful than the boar at your rear but certainly no less. energetic. 
You: His also substantial balls slap wildly against your chin, smearing your face with the scent of the pigs crotch. 
You: Audible moans now float from the crowd to your mind, and you smile dopily at the encouragement around a mouthful of pig meat. 
Stranger: Im intoxicated by the smell of the pigs musk, the taste of the precum, and the overriding pleasure of the big boars corkscrew drilling me. dont know when started, but Im practically cumming constantly, my pussy flowing with juices 
You: The boars head hangs beside your own, his panting ringing in your ears, drowning out all other noises save the slapping and squelching at your backside and the sucking and slurping of your mouth. 
You: He quickens again, driving his tip into your deepest places again and again. His cock doubles around as it reaches the limit of your depths, stretching you from within. 
You: His sack seems to tighten as it pounds your butt, the boars vocalizations signal that hes close to his limit. 
Stranger: My pussy tightens and grips its cock, encouraging it to release its load in me, to breed me, 
You: The boar is overcome with only one thought, to breed the sow below him, and his body follows suit. His cum comes in jets, pushing past all obstacles and flooding every comer of your fertile channel. 
You: But the boar does not stop, he roars above you and keeps his pace, thrusting over and over in time with his spurts. 
You: Excess cum squirts out from your depths with every motion, running down your legs, dripping from your crotch, and forming a puddle below you. 
You: The boar before you squeals his loudest as well, as if triggered by the first, and blasts a load of his own tight down your gulping maw, bulging your cheeks and spraying from your nose. 
Stranger: My pleasure plateaus as its hot, thick cum surges into me, filling every bit of me with gooey heat. 
You: Neither shows any sign of stopping, sloppy cum flows around you and begins to fill the holes made by your hands and legs. 
You: For a moment, reason springs back to your mind and a tinge of panic creeps in as you recall a pigs ejaculation can take nearly half an hour. But these thoughts are quickly pushed away by another hot blast of sticky pig cum. 
Stranger: My eyes roll back into my head, overcome by the warmth spreading all throughout me. 
You: Time is lost to you again, the applause of the crowd is met with deaf ears, nothing matters but the gooey heat spurting into you from both ends. 
You: You form is spitroasted between a pair of beasts you up until now thought of as beneath you. You are marked by their scent, by their seed, and you now know your place. On your knees, stuffed with animal cum from both ends. 
You: cock and cum* 
Stranger: am visibly shuddering undemeath them in absolute pleasure, the mud rippling around me and splashing as my tits and thighs quiver. 
You: As the boar above you slows, you are pressed as far as you can go into the slurry beneath you. Every inch of you is at this point coated with a thick mixture of cum and mud, and your own juices. 
You: You dont know how long its been, the only thing to mark passing time is the slowing rhythmic spurts inside you and the occasional sputtering gasp for air. 
You: A calmness and contentment washes over you, the enormous creatures above you not only pinning but also protecting you, shielding you from the outside world. Here, as an animal you are free from its stresses and complications. For once, life is simple. You swallow again. 
Stranger: As the pig reaches the end of its load, can feel it start to fill me with its very thick, glue-ike cum at the end of its load, plugging up my pussy deep inside. 
You: As the boars spurts slow, they become stickier, glue-like, sealing their copious juices inside your bloated frame. 
You: And when the easily ten-times-your-weight male pulls out of you, only a small dribble leaks out instead of the veritable flood that would escape otherwise. 
You: He tiredly dismounts, trots around to your still- plugged face, and gives you an approving lick on the cheek before he wades off. 
Stranger: moan into the other pigs cock in a meek protest as it pulls out of me, my pussy twitching fervently and only dribbles of cum dripping out from me. 
You: (how much longer you wanna go? Ive got half an hour and a couple more pigs if you want them.) 
Stranger: (id be up for continuing if you are ;D) 
You: (such stamina! lol) 
You: With a parting thrust as deep as he can reach into your gullet, the pig mounting your face pulls out with a slorp. 
You: You drool pig cum as a final spurt of ejaculate paints your face, and your bubbling pants come heavy at finally being allowed to breathe. 
You: Thinking your ordeal over, you go limp. your face, tits, and all plant into the now mostly-cum puddle beneath you. 
You: After a moment squirming and savoring the in the muck, you roll over only to discover a horde of more pigs around you, all with hard corkscrews and chuming balls swinging beneath them. 
Stranger: pause and take the sight in for a while, my eyes drifting up past them to the form of the crowd around the sty, watching and anticipating what do next. Slowly and shakily, lift myself up, mud and cum tunning off of my body, and tum myself over back onto my front, standing on all fours as best can in the muck and presenting my pussy for the pigs. 
You: A chorus of applause, cheers, and not a few moans flies from the crowd above you. 
You: At this sight, the pigs descend upon you ina complete frenzy, each jostling for position. 
You: They pile on top of you, on top of each other, frantically thrusting at any opening or point point of friction they can reach. 
You: How many throbbing corkscrews are assaulting your form you couldnt count even without your now delirious and cum-addled mind. 
You: The cum of the pigs before provides all the lubrication they need, one finding its way back into your pussy, two in your mouth and one intimidatingly thrusting around your still-virgin asshole. 
Stranger: hungrily take the two in my mouth and swallow their cocks as far down my throat as theyll go. I let my front end fall down, slopping into the muck and teaching my arms to the side, groping around before grabbing a piggy cock in each hand. get to work sucking and jerking off the pig cocks, my ass and hips raised up into the air. 
You: The thick, tapered member prodding at your ass finally hits home, burying itself with some effort between your plush cheeks. 
You: The intrusion is harsh at first, but quickly becomes. incredible as your only unused hole is coated with goopy animal precum. 
You: Pigs thrust at you from all angles, cocks in every orifice, every hand, and then some. The pigs and the crowd is ecstatic at your complete lack of resistance. 
You: are* 
Stranger: At the same time, Im in ecstasy, Im being violated and used by a mob of filthy pigs in a pool of thick, sloppy mud and cum and other filth. And Im loving every moment of it. 
You: In their frenzied state, it doesnt take long at all for the first pig to orgasm. A juvenile male squeals and unleashes a torrential load into your cunt, thrusting all the while. 
You: His arching spine barely makes room fora second pig to fill the gap and you cry out around your filthy mouthful as he stretches your already-filled pussy with a second cock. 
Stranger: The young pigs cum hits the plug further in and surges back out, running from my pussy in torrents from around the two cocks 
You: As before, the first pig sets off another, and the fat porker violating your hand shoots off, spraying your face and back with thick goopey ropes. 
You: You shiver at the feeling of yet more cum being pumped into you and running down your spine, when more pigs use the added lubrication to thrust at your tits, mounting you and finding nothing but rubbing their dirty cocks all over your squished orbs all the same. 
You: Before long, half of the pigs mounting your various parts are cumming. Completely dedicated to breeding, to owning their fresh sow, of making sure they use her complete submission to the fullest. 
You: The crowd around you has lost all sense of decorum, men and women stroke themselves openly, their juices running down into the slurry that coats your obscene performance. 
Stranger: My body is drenched in their hot cum, rolling off of me like waterfalls. Some of the gluey cum sticks to me, forming sticky clumps. Im hardly even doing anything any more, the pigs are all thrusting themselves against me themselves, my body is just being used by them 
You: At last, the juveniles orgasm ends and he slips out satisfied. But no sooner does another pig take his place. This is only the beginning. 
You: The sun rises high in the sky and begins to set, the market little more than an orgy by now. 
You: Pig after pig cycles past you, delivering its load only to rest and then begin again. 
You: Innumerable loads are inside you and around you. Your belly bulges, stuffed with nothing now but pig seed. 
You: You reek of it, every hole you have drips it constantly, and all you can think of is more. 
Stranger: My insides are stuffed with pig seed, numerous plugs lining my pussy, each holding back a chamber of hot pig seed 
You: Two in each hole, three in each hole? Youve lost count, all you can do is tremblingly worship every cock jammed your way. 
You: You fade in and out of consciousness, the comforting feeling of fullness and rocking thrusts sooth your mind. 
You: You gulp down pig seed like water and squirm around every cock inside you, hungrily milking them for more piggy seed. 
You: (still there?) 
Stranger: (yeah, sorry, had to step away for a moment) 
You: (all good, where do you want to go from here? feels like weve just about exhausted this premise) 
Stranger: (hm, not really sure ;p) 
You: (If you want to keep going we could let you become a fixture in the sty, as the town animal slut. Maybe even drag someone else in?) 
Stranger: (Hm, interesting :D) 
You: (Yes/no? Whats your timetable? :D) 
Stranger: (Sure, can keep going ;:p) 
You: (Yay) 
You: (start us off on part 2?) 
You: (actually could use a 5 min break) 
Stranger: (thats alright) 
You: (ok, ready when you are!) 
You: (oh and kinks-wise, am hitting the mark? anything youd like to see more/less of?) 
Stranger: It had been a month since was broken in by the pigs, and it was once again the day that the farmers market was set up in the town. All the usual stores were there, but in the pigsty all the pigs had been penned off at the far end. After last months display, it was decided that from now on in the market, would be included in the pigpen to put on another show. A crowd had already gathered early this moming to watch, and they cheered as made my way, naked, through the crowd. Once reached the fence, the people nearest it picked me up and just tossed me over the fence and straight into the mud. The boars on the other side started to squeal in excitement, itching to get at me. The crowd demanded the pigs be set loose, and the gate separating them from me was opened. 
Stranger: (Yeah, Id say youre hitting them :o) 
You: (ooh big start) 
You: By now, their was no uncertainty in anyones mind about what was about to happen here. By the looks of it, the pigs definitely recognized you. 
You: The crowd cheered as the hoard of boars rushed forward, each intent on being the first in a coveted spot inside their sow. 
You: Somehow unsurpriseg, you notice that the muck is even deeper this time, the pigs keepers apparently saving up the grime and muck from the entire month just for you. 
Stranger: get myself into position, all fours with my hips raised, eagerly anticipating the day ahead of me. hadnt been able to fuck the pigs again since the first time, and so Id been waiting all month for this, thought Id go crazy waiting. All this pent up lust, combined with the strong musk of the pigsty, means by pussy is already sopping wet and ready for them. 
You: From the looks of it, the pigs feel the same way. They descend upon you cocks only just hardening but jostling for position all the same. 
You: Normally they would follow a rough order, the smaller males allowing the larger boars to mount first. 
You: However, in light of last month, none cared for hierarchy, much to the fury of one particular massive male. 
You: Every time he tried to use his weight to push aside another of his kind, he was met with resistance by three others. 
You: Failing to gain a spot and far to upset to wait his tum, the boars eyes fell upon something else. 
You: A woman leaned just a bit too far over the railing, trying to get a good look at you inside the squirming mass of pig. 
You: The huge boar eyed her hungrily. Perhaps this isnt the only breeding sow here. 
You: you arent* 
You: (would you like to play the second woman as. well?) 
Stranger: (sure ;p) 
Stranger: Some members of the crowd notice where the woman being eyed up by the big boar. Looks like he wants a piece of you! someone jeers, and the people around her start whooping. She barely has time to react as a number of people grab her legs and flip her up and over the fence, landing her in the mud too, much to the crowds delight. 
You: The poor girl barely rights herself and looks up terrified. Up to her knees in mud and who knows what else, she staggers back at the huge males advance. To her dismay, the crowd only applauds louder. 
You: Meanwhile, doing your best to work every pig cock around you out of its sheath, you recognize the girl as the very same that first saw you. The very one who didnt call for help. 
Stranger: While Im sort of thankful of that now, cant help but feel this would be some nice comeuppance, especially since she started rubbing herself when she first saw me. dont bother to try and get up to help her, not that could anyway. My pussy is absolutely drenched in anticipation, the small boars are still too busy fighting for position that they still havent entered me. 
You: And in an instant, the great male was upon the girl. Effortlessly bowling her over onto her back, he stood menacingly before her. 
You: She closed her eyes, anticipating that the enormous animal would crush her. 
You: A moment passed, she waited, and he never came. 
You: Wrenching open her teary eyes, she stared up at the face of the boar right above hers. She could feel his gaze boring into her as she lie there dumbfounded. 
You: It was only then that she realized. He was expectant. He wanted her to present herself. 
You: He had already broken one sow by force. This one was going to beg. 
Stranger: She stared back up the boar, running through every possibility in her head? Should she try to escape? Would they just throw her back in? What does. he want her to do? Then her mind went back to the time when she first saw me, and the look of sheer pleasure on my face, and started to have thoughts... 
You: The crowd was now nearly silent, the tension in the air was palpable. 
You: Then, quietly at first but rising in number with every repetition, they begin to chant. 
You: Do it. Do it! DO IT! Yo e chant echoed off every comer of the pen and you could swear that once again, you could see that huge boar smiling 
Stranger: As the chant grows, images of me being fucked fills her head, the moans made, how good must have felt. As if now in a trance, she slowly sits up in the mud, and begins undressing as the chant grows louder and faster. She tosses her clothes aside until she too is completely naked, then slowly and tentatively crouches down on all fours. The crows whoops and hollers in approval. 
You: The boar bellows victoriously, and the crowd cheers with him. He takes his position on top of this new sow, and vigorously prods her rear entrances with his massive corkscrew. 
You: The trembling girl winces and knows she must make a decision before it is made for her, which hole will she offer to this pig? 
You: By now the others are hard at work on you, once more savoring the feeling of being completely stuffed by porcine prick. 
Stranger: Occupied with the other pigs, can only just manage to keep tabs on the other woman, my mind already starting to cloud. After some thought, she tries to aim the boars cock at her pussy, raising her hips so they line up as close as she can. 
You: After just a few more prods the boars head hits its mark in the poor girls pussy, and pressing his incredible weight forward, the beast drives his tapered cock in. Deeper it works in, growing wider with each inch. 
You: The girl down on her hands and knees is positively dwarfed by the animal above her, and gasps. can be heard from the crowd followed by whistling and cheers. A show by both of the now-town-pig-sluts can at last begin. 
Stranger: can tell that shes just been penetrated, and can just make out her form undemeath the massive boar. almost feel a small twinge of jealousy 
You: Not to be forgotten, the pigs around you work vigorously, a full months worth of pent up desire from each being unleashed at once. 
You: You are practically assaulted in their excitement, their cocks harder than youve ever felt before. 
You: The huge male begins to powerfully jack-hammer into the girl, her wimpers are lost beneath the sloppy sucking of the mud and her pussy. 
You: Once again, seeing his chance, a bold pig moves. up to fill the girls other unused end with stiff pig meat. 
Stranger: She finds herself quickly overwhelmed, swamped by all these new sensations, and she cannot resist their advances. It seems that shes resigned to going with the flow. Meanwhile, Im quickly losing myself again to the pleasure of being gangbanged by a bunch of pigs 
You: More and more pigs surround her as her will caves, all too eager to take advantage. One slips in her mouth, inching deeper little by litle. Another prods her forearm, the smart creature having leamed what a hand is capable of. 
You: All the while the boar pummeling her pussy speeds up, apparently much more pent up this time than the last. 
You: The eager pack of pigs atop you picks up their pace as well, all know that the first one to unload in a sow will be the most likely to give her piglets. 
Stranger: press my hips back into them, encouraging them to release their load into me. The other woman is now also losing herself to the pleasure of the pig screw, and finds herself cumming on their cocks as they pound her. 
You: The pigs are ecstatic, remembering just how eager you are for this. Their frantic thrusts push deep, twisting as far as they can into your deepest reaches, throbbing and squirming as they approach their limit. 
You: The giant boar pressing down on the girlis no exception, and with a final few ragged thrusts that threaten to bury her in the greasy muck, his impossibly wide member begins to twitch and sputter. 
You: Then, at once, the crowd is treated to two beautiful women being pumped utterly full by a pack of homy pigs. 
You: They cascade one after another, thick hot globs of pig seed being unloaded into hungry mouths, cunts, and asses. 
Stranger: relish in the feeling, as the hot pig cum fills me in every cranny and crevice inside me. The other woman is caught off guard by it and her eyes widen as hot pig seed is poured into her. 
You: The pigs pay no heed to the girls inexperience, showing no mercy in their assault. The massive corkscrew buried in her pussy heaves, the brunt of an entire months worth of desire bubbling inside her. 
You: In less than a minute she is stuffed with as much fluid as her poor pussy can hold and the excess spurts out of her drooling hole. 
You: The pig using her face is less precise in his work. His cock popping wildly around her mouth, down her throat and all over her face as he cums. 
You: Meanwhile your suitors oblige their willing sow and you find pigs of every size and weight pinning you and filling you full all at once. 
You: Each is determined to be the one to make you mother his young.</span></div></div>

You: Sure 
Stranger: Great! Who do you play? 
You: Usually Canada, though Im flexible with others 
Stranger: main Prussia (specifically nyo, but also do Gilbert and can switch between depending) 
You: Works for me 
Stranger: Any AUs youre fond of? 
You: Its been a hot minute since Ive rped, so Im open to just about anything 
Stranger: What a fat mood 
You: Imao 
You: anything you wanna be avoiding in the rp? 
Stranger: Honestly like think we could burn that bridge when we get to it. Wbu? 
You: sounds good 
Stranger: Idk think recently Ive either been wanting something darker or the literary equivalent of wrapping me up in a blanket and giving me something to sob heavily into 
You: feel that pretty hard 
Stranger: Idk had a thing a few weeks ago where Gil was this figure skating star and like his girlfriend cheated on him, he broke up with her, and he went away with his brother to try and get away from her bc she just wont leave him tf alone 
Stranger: could deffo see Matt meeting him on the ice and just being like wtf why does this guy looksosad 
You: Im down for that if you want 
Stranger: That way, we get the sad boi Gil trying to get over heartbreak while his ex still tries to get in touch with him 
Stranger: And it could somehow get darker if we decide so 
You: Yeah 
Stranger: might even have a starter knocking around 
You: You should check 
Stranger: Nope, not one that fits. can just type up another 
You: Thanks! 
Stranger: This was the last straw. At last, Gilbert put his phone onto aeroplane mode after once again blocking yet another number she was trying to call him from. This wasnt fair! He had come to this rink in another country to get away from her once and for all, and she couldnt respect that he didnt want to hear from her. She had broken his trust, his heart, and drove him away. This trip with his brother was meant to calm him the fuck down, but it didnt help that his anxiety peaked every time she called him. No, this was his time. Gilbert was going to enjoy his time. With a deep breath, he put his headphones on and walked over on his little knife shoes to the ice. His time. At last, with the music on and very few people around at this early hour, he was able to skate how he wanted. There was no competition, no need for real technique. Instead, he just let his heart guide his feet. Those moves were pretty impressive understandable when you consider that he is, in fact, a professional figure skater. Ballet inspired and with such grace to a piece he had skated to for a long, long time. At last, his head was just empty. 
You: Matthew hadnt gone beyond local competitions for his figure skating, but he was decidedly the best in his city, and that was partially because of how frequently he skated in the early hours of the morning. Whether it was indoors or outdoors, he always got a good skate in to keep his skills sharp. That being said, it threw him for a bit of a loop to not only see someone else, but a complete stranger already on the rink when he got there. He brushed off the surprise as he slid onto the ice, music low on his headphones for him to focus better on the moves. That effort was little use when the other mans moves were drawing his gaze, admiring the skill it took to pull them off so fluidly. 
Stranger: Gilbert had barely even noticed the presence of someone else in the rink. Already, he was so engrossed in the music that he just kept moving and couldnt stop. It rose, climbing to a peak which finally replaced his anxiety and then... it stopped. From that amazing high came a reverberating silence and simultaneous foot stomp as his hands went up out of habit. His piece was over. Finally, he noticed the other man. Fuck, there was someone else here. In these ungodly hours, there was only the two of them in this whole place. Slowly, he removed his headphones to look at the other and offer an awkward smile. He had thought he would be alone for a little while, at least. Oh well. 
You: Matthew had almost stopped his skating from how closely he was watching, offering up a smile when he saw the other finally acknowledge him. He skated over to him, stopping almost as smoothly as hed moved once he was in front of him. Sorry for intruding, but... that was beautiful. Its been a while since Ive gotten to watch someone else without a crowd or announcers. He looked over his face, trying to place a name to it but without success. Are you new around here? Im usually the only one here this early. 
Stranger: Gilbert let his headphones hang around his neck while his hands slipped into his pockets to pause his music. It had been a while since he was able to just relax like this. Im just visiting for a couple of weeks to reset. Are you here every morning? That would definitely be commitment. In fact, it was probably the same amount of commitment he put in and this was his job! It seemed this guy didnt recognise him, so that was an added bonus. Maybe he would be able to skate in peace without someone fanning over him for the next few weeks. This whole trip was his escape. 
You: Matthew nodded, giving him a smile. Yeah. practice in the mornings before starting the day. Its usually the only time have for it. He offered his hand, that gentle look still on his face. Im Matthew. Sorry again for interrupting you, you just looked so focused, it was hard not to watch. 
Stranger: Gilbert looked at the hand for a moment before shaking it. God, this guy was cute. So gentle and honest looking... Gilbert. Dont worry about it, by the way. really didnt even notice you until was done. As bad as he felt, skating just put him in his own little world. Even his hand was soft, holy crap. He was just a soft guy! 
You: Matthew gave his hand a small squeeze before letting go, brushing his bangs out of the way of his glasses. Im not hard to miss, dont blame you. He glanced over his face once more, noticing that somewhat sombre expression now that Gilbert wasnt wholly distracted by his skating. I should let you get back to skating. Dont think you came to talk to a stranger. 
Stranger: Gilbert was honestly a bi mess. If he wasnt in such a horrible constant state of mind, he would probably want to talk to this guy more and get to know him. Matthew was cute and looked like he would be nice to get coffee with some time, but that wasnt what he was here for. He was here to calm down. He offered a small smile and reached for his headphones. Have a nice skate, Matthew. Ill try not to get in the way. With that, he pressed play and went right back to his skating. His heart pounded with a feeling he couldnt quite place. Whatever it was, he wasnt happy with it. 
You: Matthew gave him a soft nod, moving to replace his own headphones. The same to you. He let his music pick back up, going to the other side of the rink to give Gilbert room. The music carried him off, though he couldnt help glancing towards the other man now and then to just admire his movements before focusing back on his own movements. It was nice to have another person in the rink with him, dancing separately but together. 
You: (Is there somewhere we could move this to? have to go before too long 
Stranger: ((Would email be chill?)) 
You: (Yeah, totally 
Stranger: ((Mine is iceflarepassiongmail.com)) 
You: ((Sent u an email 
Stranger: Gilbert finally left the rink for a drink of water after about half an hour. His head had calmed somewhat, but taking his phone off aeroplane mode made him grimace. As usual, his brother had sent him a text to let him know what he would be doing for the day in case Gilbert wanted to come along, but there were also several messages from an unknown Twitter account. His hands shook. No, no, she couldnt just leave him alone, could she? The messages were becoming threatening now. Hell, she was two seconds away from threatening to kill herself if he didnt talk to her. He couldnt do this. 
Stranger: ((Got it!)) 
Stranger: ((I sent the log over to you probs preemptively whoops)) 
You: Matthew noticed when Gilbert left the rink, looking slightly concerned when he saw him shaking from just looking at him phone. Not his business, so he wasnt going to go interrupt. He just paid a bit more attention to the other man when he could, just to make sure he didnt need any immediate help. Maybe he should have gone to talk to him, but he already felt like hed done too much intruding for that. 
You: ((Its alright. You wanna just reply on email? 
Stranger: ((Could be a shout tbh)) 
You: ((? 
Stranger: ((Yeah no its a good idea, we should probs do that)) 
You: ((alright. ill disconnect, you wanna send the rest of it with your reply? 
Stranger: ((Can do!))</span></div></div>

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>~10k conversations from Omegle. Scraped using: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/xd?url=logs.omegle.com/*&amp;fl=timestamp,original,statuscode&amp;output=json">http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/xd?url=logs.omegle.com/*&amp;fl=timestamp,original,statuscode&amp;output=json</a>. For these logs to have ended up on the cdx, it means the url was posted publicly at some point. </p>
<ul>
<li>PII removed by searching for conversations with these words: forbidden_words = ["kik", "telegram", "skype", "wickr", "discord", "dropbox", "insta ", "insta?", "instagram", "snap ", "snapchat"].</li>
<li>Conversations with racial slurs removed.</li>
<li>English only.</li>
<li>Obviously, the dataset still contains a lot of (sometimes extreme) NSFW content. Do not view or use this dataset if you are under 18.</li>
</ul>
<p>General process for scraping (There are probably other datasets that can be scraped using this method):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to page in archive.org cdx</li>
<li>Check if the page contains a log</li>
<li>Download the log image</li>
<li>Use OCR to read it</li>
<li>Save it to a json file.</li>
</ol>
<p>This dataset could be useful for training casual conversational AI's but it likely still requires more filtering. Use at your own risk.</p>
