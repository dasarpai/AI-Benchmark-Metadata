to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.\nFor example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.&quot;:28,&quot;Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.\nLines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.\nLines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.\nTogether, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.&quot;:69,&quot;In an environment, organisms interact with each other and with their nonliving surroundings. To help describe these interactions, ecologists use specific terms for different types of groups.\nA single organism is an individual. Individuals of the same species that live in the same place are part of a population.\nMultiple populations of different species that live in the same place are part of a community.\nTogether, communities of living organisms and the nonliving parts of their environment make up an ecosystem.&quot;:7,&quot;Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.&quot;:4,&quot;A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent&quot;:192,&quot;Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.\nThe trees danced in the wind.\nThe word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving.&quot;:63,&quot;Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.\nThe food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.\nConsumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:\nA primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.\nA secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.\nA tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.\nA top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!&quot;:13,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nTemperature can be written with units of degrees Fahrenheit (°F) or Celsius (°C). Use the list below to compare the two units.\n212°F | Water boils | 100°C\n98.6°F | Body temperature | 37°C\n68°F | Room temperature | 20°C\n32°F | Water freezes | 0°C\n&quot;:28,&quot;Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.\nSome solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.\nA glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.\nThink about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.\nJuice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.\nWhen matter is a gas, it spreads out to fill a space.\nMany gases are invisible. So, you can’t see them. Air is a gas.&quot;:17,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.&quot;:14,&quot;A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.\nSome objects are made of just one material.\nMost nails are made of metal.\nOther objects are made of more than one material.\nThis hammer is made of metal and wood.&quot;:31,&quot;Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.\nMoss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.\nThe sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.\nThe fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.\nWhen the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.&quot;:5,&quot;Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?\nHow do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.\nIf both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.\nIf both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4&quot;:34,&quot;A simple sentence is a sentence with only one subject and predicate.\nThe pitcher threw the ball to first base.\nA compound sentence is two simple sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nThe pitcher threw the ball, and the batter hit it.\nSome simple sentences have a compound subject or a compound predicate, but they are not compound sentences.\nAnna and James will watch the fireworks tonight.\nThis simple sentence has a compound subject, Anna and James.\nThe singers bowed and walked off the stage.\nThis simple sentence has a compound predicate, bowed and walked off the stage.\nSome simple sentences have introductory phrases, but they are not compound sentences. The introductory phrase is part of the predicate.\nIn the winter, Farmer Ben wears his heavy coat.\nThis is a simple sentence. There is one subject, Farmer Ben, and one predicate, wears his heavy coat in the winter.&quot;:76,&quot;The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\ndivergent plate boundary\nWhen plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.\nNewer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.&quot;:5,&quot;Writers can organize their ideas in different ways. These ways of organizing writing are called text structures. When you can tell how a text is organized, it's easier to understand how the writer's ideas go together. You can also use these text structures to organize your own writing.\n | Text structure | Where you might find it | Words and phrases to look for\nA sequential structure tells you about events that happen in a certain order. | a recipe for how to make a blueberry pie | first, until, second, after, next, then, before, finally, during\nA cause-effect structure shows the causes and the effects, or results, of an event. | an essay about how recycling helps the environment | because, led to, since, as a result, due to, so, reason\nA problem-solution structure explains a problem and offers possible solutions. | an article about ways to get more people to vote | issue, suggest, question, puzzle, fix, answer\nA compare-contrast structure shows how two (or more) things are the same or different. | a chapter about the differences between whales and sharks | like, unlike, too, on the other hand, both, while, same, instead, common, different, as well as, however\nA descriptive structure tells you a list of details about an object, scene, or topic. | a paragraph about what Tyrannosaurus rex looked like| for example, near, for instance beside, such as, most important, also&quot;:4,&quot;An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.\nThe protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.\nThe word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.&quot;:55,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nAlliteration is the repetition of sounds at the beginning of nearby words.\nWhat a lucky little lady you are!\nAn allusion is a brief reference to something or someone well known, often from history or literature.\n\&quot;I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!\&quot; Lila remarked.\nAn idiom is an expression that cannot be understood literally.

People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.\nOlivia seems thrilled that her car keeps breaking down.\nEach breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face.&quot;:115,&quot;A grid is made up of lines of squares. They are organized in rows and columns. A grid can help you use a map.\nA row is a line of squares that goes from side to side. Rows are marked with letters.\nA column is a line of squares that goes up and down. Columns are marked with numbers.&quot;:33,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.&quot;:58,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.&quot;:25,&quot;A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.\nMy friends walk along the path.\nA run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.\nI knocked on the door it opened.\nIt started raining, we ran inside.\nTo fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.\nI knocked on the door. It opened.\nIt started raining. We ran inside.\nYou can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nI knocked on the door, and it opened.\nIt started raining, so we ran inside.&quot;:28,&quot;Chemical changes and physical changes are two ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. The paper changes into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.\nCutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.\nIce melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state.&quot;:17,&quot;Authors write texts for different purposes, or reasons. Common purposes for writing are to persuade, to inform, or to entertain readers.\nAuthors persuade by convincing readers to believe or do something.\nAn advertisement tries to convince readers to buy a product.\nA political poster tries to convince readers to vote for someone.\nAuthors inform by telling readers about a topic or process.\nA news article explains something that happened.\nA recipe describes how to cook a dish.\nAuthors entertain by giving readers something to enjoy.\nA joke tries to make readers laugh.\nA poem tries to please readers.&quot;:3,&quot;The fruits and vegetables we eat are parts of plants! Plants are made up of different structures. The different structures carry out important functions.\nThe roots take in water and nutrients from the soil. They also hold the plant in place in the soil.\nThe stem supports the plant. It carries food, water, and nutrients through the plant.\nThe leaves are where most of the plant's photosynthesis happens. Photosynthesis is the process plants use to turn water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide into food.\nAfter they are pollinated, the flowers make seeds and fruit.\nThe fruit contain the seeds. Each fruit grows from a pollinated flower.\nThe seeds can grow into a new plant. Germination is when a seed begins to grow.&quot;:18,&quot;A letter starts with a greeting and ends with a closing. For each one, capitalize the first word and end with a comma. You should also capitalize proper nouns, such as Aunt Sue.\nDear Aunt Sue,\nI'm glad you could come to my party, and\nthank you for the birthday gift. I could not have\nasked for a better one! Every time I see it, I think\nof you.\nWith love,\nRory&quot;:197,&quot;A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.\nThe primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.\nThe volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\n&quot;:15,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nWhen you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.\nThere are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.\nA football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long.&quot;:60,&quot;There are four kinds of sentences.\nA declarative sentence is a statement, and it always ends with a period.\nThe nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.\nAn interrogative sentence is a question, and it always ends with a question mark.\nDo you have any plans for the upcoming weekend?\nAn imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something, and it usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.\nFor this assignment, use references to support your claims.\nDon't drive so quickly in the construction zone!\nAn exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.\nI can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!&quot;:47,&quot;Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.&quot;:170,&quot;Rocks are made of minerals. Here are some properties of rocks:\nThey are solid.\nThey are formed in nature.\nThey are not made by living things.\nThey are not pure substances.&quot;:23,&quot;All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.&quot;:65,&quot;Living things are made up of four main groups of carbon-based molecules called organic compounds. One of these groups is carbohydrates. The other three groups are lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.\nAll carbohydrates are made up of the same three chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But carbohydrate molecules can come in different forms. The smallest carbohydrates are called simple sugars. Simple sugars can be linked together in long chains to make larger carbohydrates, called complex carbohydrates.\nCarbohydrates can also have different functions. An important function of carbohydrates is to provide the primary source of energy for cells. Cells can quickly break down many types of carbohydrates to release energy, so these carbohydrates provide energy for cells' immediate use. Carbohydrates can also form cell structures. One complex carbohydrate, called cellulose, forms the cell walls in plant cells. Cellulose helps to give plants structure and make them strong.&quot;:1,&quot;Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.&quot;:20,&quot;All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.&quot;:45,&quot;All living things are made up of cells. Plants, animals, and some fungi have many cells. Other living things are made up of just one cell.\nAll living things need food and water. Water helps living things break down food and remove waste. Food gives living things energy. They use energy from food to grow and change.\nAll living things sense changes in their environment. Living things might sense changes by seeing, smelling, hearing, or feeling. Living things can respond to the changes they sense.&quot;:25,&quot;A continent is one of the major land masses on the earth. Most people say there are seven continents.&quot;:94,&quot;Birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are groups of animals. The animals in each group have traits in common.\nScientists sort animals into groups based on traits they have in common. This process is called classification.&quot;:99,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.&quot;:54,&quot;The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.\nWeather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.\nClimate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.&quot;:166,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.&quot;:14,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.&quot;:14,&quot;A fact is something that can be proved by research or observation.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was shorter than King Louis XVI.\nThe statement above is a fact. The statement can be proved by researching the height of each man and comparing them.\nAn opinion is something that a person believes, thinks, or feels. An opinion cannot be proved.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a better leader than King Louis XVI.\nThe statement above is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a \&quot;better\&quot; leader, so the statement cannot be proved.&quot;:10,&quot;The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.\nAppeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:\nsay that a brand has been trusted for many years\ninclude an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association\nfeature a testimonial from a \&quot;real person\&quot; who shares the audience's values\nuse an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson\nAppeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:\nuse graphs or charts to display information\ncite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies\nexplain the science behind a product or service\nemphasize that the product is a financially wise choice\nanticipate and refute potential counterclaims\nAppeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:\ntrigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment\nappeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive\nlink the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury&quot;:21,&quot;A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.\nFossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.\nThe relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.&quot;:16,&quot;Rhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme. They both end with the same sound.\nThe words meet and treat also rhyme. They both end with the same sound, even though the sound has two different spellings.\nThe words tip and meet don't rhyme. They end with different sounds.&quot;:29,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nAnaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses.\nWe are united. We are powerful. We are winners.\nAntithesis involves contrasting opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.\nI want to help, not to hurt.\nApostrophe is a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity.\nOh, little bird, what makes you sing so beautifully?\nAssonance is the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words.\nTry to light the fire.\nChiasmus is an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words.\nNever let a fool kiss you or a kiss fool you.\nUnderstatement involves deliberately representing something as less serious or important than it really is.\nAs you know, it can get a little cold in the Antarctic.&quot;:41,&quot;Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!&quot;:171,&quot;Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.\nCosts are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.\nBenefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need.&quot;:112,&quot;Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.\nA poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.\nEnd rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.\nLittle Betty Blue,\nLost her holiday shoe.\n—From Mother Goose\nInternal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.\nSweet dreams of pleasant streams.\n—From William Blake, \&quot;A Cradle Song\&quot;\nRhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \&quot;The Eagle\&quot;\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n—From Hilda Conkling, \&quot;The Old Bridge\&quot;\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \&quot;The Flying Squirrel\&quot;\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n—From Bayard Taylor, \&quot;A Night with a Wolf\&quot;\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n—From Alfred Noyes, \&quot;The Highwayman\&quot;\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n—From Mary Howitt, \&quot;The Voice of Spring\&quot;&quot;:12,&quot;A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.\nA sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought.\nRehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.\nThis fragment is missing a subject. It doesn't tell who is rehearsing.\nThe band I'm in.\nThis fragment is missing a verb. It doesn't tell what the band I'm in is doing.\nBecause we have a concert in two weeks.\nThis fragment is missing an independent clause. It doesn't tell what happened because of the concert.&quot;:28,&quot;A fact is something that can be proved to be true.\nThe month of July has more days than the month of June.\nThis is a fact. It can be proved by looking at a calendar and counting the number of days in each month.\nAn opinion is something that a person believes, thinks, or feels. An opinion cannot be proved true.\nJuly is a better month than June for camping.\nThis is an opinion. People may have different opinions about which month is \&quot;better\&quot; for camping.&quot;:35,&quot;A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.\nThe primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.\nThe volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 · 1000\n= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3\n= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)\n= 1.43 x 10^18\n&quot;:27,&quot;The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:\nAppeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:\nsay that a brand has been trusted for many years\nnote that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity\ninclude a quote from a \&quot;real person\&quot; who shares the audience's values\nAppeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:\nuse graphs or charts to display information\nmention the results of scientific studies\nexplain the science behind a product or service\nAppeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:\ntrigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment\nappeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive\nlink the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury&quot;:24,&quot;Reptiles have scaly, waterproof skin. Most reptiles live on land.&quot;:10,&quot;A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.\nThe direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.\nThe direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.&quot;:14,&quot;Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.\nMinerals and rocks have the following properties:\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\nLook closely at the last three properties:\nMinerals and rocks are not made by organisms.\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!&quot;:70,&quot;An ecosystem is formed when living and nonliving things interact in an environment. There are many types of ecosystems. Here are some ways in which ecosystems can differ from each other:\nthe pattern of weather, or climate\nthe type of soil or water\nthe organisms that live there&quot;:47,&quot;An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.\nAn object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:\nmoving in a straight line at a constant speed, or\nremaining motionless.\nIf an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:\nspeeding up,\nslowing down, or\nchanging direction.&quot;:10,&quot;Plagiarism is the act of taking another person's work or ideas and presenting them as your own, either accidentally or on purpose. When you use an outside source in your own writing, you should make sure to cite the source in order to avoid plagiarism. Consider the following source:\nFisher, Goddu, and Keil, \&quot;Searching for Explanations: How the Internet Inflates Estimates of Internal Knowledge.\&quot; Copyright 2015 by the American Psychological Association\nThe results of these experiments suggest that searching the Internet may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge. Searching for explanations on the Internet inflates self-assessed knowledge in unrelated domains.\nIf you use a direct quotation in your writing, you must use quotation marks around the exact words that were copied from the source, in addition to citing the source.\nResearchers have found that relying on the Internet for information may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge.\nThis sentence is plagiarized because it uses the source's exact words without quotation marks and without properly citing the source.\nResearchers have found that relying on the Internet for information \&quot;may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge\&quot; (Fisher, Goddu, and Keil).\nIf you paraphrase a source, or put a source's ideas into your own words, you must still cite the source. Even if properly cited, a paraphrase that is too similar to the source in wording or sentence structure is still considered plagiarized.\nAccording to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, searching the Internet can lead to a regular failure to perceive the extent to which we rely on outside knowledge.\nThis sentence is plagiarized because it is an insufficient paraphrase. Even though it is properly cited, it borrows too much of the source's wording and sentence structure.\nAccording to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, relying on the Internet to look up information can make it difficult for us to estimate how much of our knowledge comes from internal versus external sources.\nThere are different rules about how to format citations, such as when to include page numbers for print sources. Check a style guide, such as the Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook, for a complete list of these rules.&quot;:3,&quot;Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.\nWhen a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\nBritney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.\nThe traditional usage above is considered more standard.\nDavid perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.\nThe nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.&quot;:130,&quot;The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nocean-continent subduction zone\nOne type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust.\nAs the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc.&quot;:3,&quot;Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.\nSome solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.\nA glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.\nThink about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.\nJuice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.&quot;:30,&quot;Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.\nA material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells.&quot;:38,&quot;Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.\nA good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.\nA service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service.&quot;:54,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nAnaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses.\nWe are united. We are powerful.

A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.\nForces can be different sizes.\nThink about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.&quot;:37,&quot;Scientists record climate data from places around the world. Precipitation, or rain and snow, is one type of climate data. Scientists collect data over many years. They can use this data to calculate the average precipitation for each month. The average precipitation can be used to describe the climate of a location.\nA bar graph can be used to show the average amount of precipitation each month. Months with taller bars have more precipitation on average.&quot;:23,&quot;Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.&quot;:23,&quot;Humans have invented many ways to use natural resources. We use energy from natural resources in our daily activities, including cooking food, moving objects, and powering machines.\nSome ways of using natural resources for energy add to air pollution, and others do not.\nWood, oil, and coal are examples of natural resources that are fuels. Burning a fuel provides energy. But it also releases chemicals that can be harmful to our health and to the environment. These chemicals add to air pollution.\nSunlight, wind, and water are natural resources that can provide energy. Using energy from the Sun, wind, or water does not burn material. These uses of energy do not release chemicals that add to air pollution.&quot;:3,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nVolume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.\nThere are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.\nAs the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.\nA glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.&quot;:44,&quot;Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:\nType | Examples\nslang | cool, awesome\nidioms | knock your socks off\nconversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah\nabbreviated language | ASAP, FYI\noverly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store\ncontractions | can't, won't\nContractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.\nCompare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.\nInformal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.\nFormal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.\n&quot;:40,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.&quot;:5,&quot;Some animals have a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. An animal's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each animal's backbone is colored orange.\nOther animals do not have a backbone. In fact, these animals don't have any bones! Some animals without backbones have a hard outer cover. Other animals have a soft body.&quot;:37,&quot;A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.\nA run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.\nThere are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:\nUse stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.\nUse a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.\nUse a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.&quot;:30,&quot;During a chemical reaction, thermal energy is absorbed or released as heat. This transfer of thermal energy changes the temperature of the reaction's surroundings. The surroundings are everything around the reaction, such as the solution that the reaction takes place in or the air nearby.\nSome reactions release thermal energy into the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted from chemical energy, which is provided by the molecules in the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the reaction and into the surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings increases.\nSome reactions absorb thermal energy from the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted into chemical energy during the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the surroundings and into the reaction, the temperature of the surroundings decreases.&quot;:5,&quot;People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.\nAn urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.\nA suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.\nA rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.\nSome places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.&quot;:6,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nAn idiom is an expression that cannot be understood literally. Its meaning must be learned.\nThe assignment was a piece of cake.&quot;:32,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper.\nIn a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend.&quot;:5,&quot;Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.\nProducers make their own food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. This sugar is food for the producer.\nConsumers eat other organisms. Consumers cannot make their own food.&quot;:12,&quot;The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.\nFossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.\nHere are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:\nThis is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.\nThis is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.\nThis is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.\nAn organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.&quot;:26,&quot;Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.\nScientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\nA ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.\nThe balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.\nEvery element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.\nSo, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.&quot;:11,&quot;Scientists record climate data from places around the world. Temperature is one type of climate data. Scientists collect data over many years. They can use this data to calculate the average temperature for each month. The average temperature can be used to describe the climate of a location.\nA line graph can be used to show the average temperature each month. Months with higher dots on the graph have higher average temperatures.&quot;:24,&quot;A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.\nA mixture is made of two or more types of matter mixed together.&quot;:13,&quot;The title of a book, movie, play, TV show, magazine, or newspaper should be in italics. If you write it by hand, it can be underlined instead.\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\nThe title of a poem, song, article, or short story should be in quotation marks.\n\&quot;You Are My Sunshine\&quot;&quot;:54,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nWhether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.\nHere are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.\nIf different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.\nIf the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.\n&quot;:72,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.&quot;:26,&quot;Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.\nTo put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.&quot;:54,&quot;A food web is a model.\nModels can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.\nArrows show how matter moves.\nA food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.\nA living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.\nA living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.&quot;:7,&quot;Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.\nMature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.\nWhen a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.\nFertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.\nThe mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.&quot;:3,&quot;Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.&quot;:24,&quot;When a scientist identifies a new organism, he or she chooses its scientific name.\nSometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.\nMany of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek. The new words are then used in an organism's scientific name.&quot;:18,&quot;Authors use different text structures to organize their ideas in writing. Learning to identify these structures will help you to understand the relationships between ideas in informational texts. You can also use these structures to organize your own writing.\nA cause-effect structure presents the causes and the effects of a particular event, trend, or situation. This structure often uses words and phrases such as because, since, as a result, due to, or consequently.\nA compare-contrast structure presents similarities (comparisons) and differences (contrasts) between two or more things. This structure often uses words and phrases such as like, similarly, or in the same way (for comparing) or on the other hand, in contrast, or unlike (for contrasting).\nA problem-solution structure presents a problem and suggests one or more possible solutions. This structure often uses words such as issue, question, puzzle, propose, and answer.\nA sequential structure describes a series of events that happens in a certain order. This structure often uses specific dates and times or words such as first, next, during, finally, and while.&quot;:2,&quot;Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.\nA material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.\nFor example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it.&quot;:57,&quot;A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.&quot;:44,&quot;Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:\nIt is a solid.\nIt is formed in nature.\nIt is not made by organisms.\nIt is a pure substance.\nIt has a fixed crystal structure.\nIf a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.\nLook closely at the last three properties:\nA mineral is not made by organisms.\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.\nA mineral is a pure substance.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\n&quot;:47,&quot;Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nCutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.&quot;:21,&quot;Every living thing needs food to stay alive. Living things get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how living things in an ecosystem get their food.\nProducers make their own food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. This sugar is food for the producer.\nConsumers eat other living things. Consumers cannot make their own food.&quot;:9,&quot;An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it.\nDifferent objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups.&quot;:52,&quot;People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.&quot;:171,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.&quot;:11,&quot;The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nOne type of convergent boundary is a continent-continent collision. This type of boundary forms when two plates with continental crust move toward each other. The collision compresses and folds the continental crust, forcing it upward to form a mountain range.&quot;:3,&quot;&quot;:2034,&quot;Natural resources are useful things that come directly from nature. They are not made by people.\nClay is an example of a natural resource. It comes directly from nature, and people can use it in many ways.\nA clay pot is not a natural resource. It is created by people. However, a clay pot is made from a natural resource.&quot;:1,&quot;An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it.\nDifferent objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification.&quot;:114,&quot;To learn about the past, historians look at many different sources. Sources are books, documents, pictures, or other materials that provide evidence about the past.\nThe sources that historians use fall into two categories: primary sources and secondary sources. The category for a source can change depending on what the historian is trying to learn, who created the source, and when it was created.\nThe table below shows some common characteristics of primary and secondary sources.\n | Primary source | Secondary sources\nDescription | firsthand accounts of a historical event that the historian is studying | secondhand accounts of a historical event that the historian is studying; sources that interpret or analyze many primary sources\nAuthor | usually created or used by a person who participated in the event | usually created by someone who did not participate in the event\nDate | usually created at or around the time of the event | usually created after the event\nCommon examples | speeches; diaries; letters; photographs; artifacts such as household objects; exact copies of sources or artifacts; | textbooks; history books; documentary (non-fiction) films; articles by historians; museum exhibits\nSome sources are neither primary nor secondary sources because they do not provide historical information about the topic being studied. For example, a historian would not use a historical novel to learn about an event. Other sources may not relate to a historian's goal.&quot;:1,&quot;When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.\nWhen Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.\nVague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:\n1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:\nWhen Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.\n2. Rewrite the sentence:\nLisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.\nA vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.\nThey say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.\nThe pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.\nThis problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.\nThe advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.&quot;:148,&quot;Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the same&quot;:47,&quot;Rhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme. They both end with the ip sound.\nThe words lake and make rhyme. They both end with the ake sound.\nThe words tip and lake don't rhyme. They end with different sounds.&quot;:23,&quot;The title of a book, movie, play, TV show, magazine, or newspaper should be in italics. If you write it by hand, it can be underlined instead.\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\nThe title of a poem, song, or article should be in quotation marks.\n\&quot;You Are My Sunshine\&quot;&quot;:12,&quot;A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.\nAn independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.\nthe oranges on our tree are ripe\nThe clause can stand alone. It is independent.\nafter we pick up Kevin from work\nThe clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.\nA simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.\nBen and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.\nSome simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.\nIn the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.\nBen usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.\nA compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nWe saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.\nA complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.\nIf she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.\nDuring his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.\nA compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\nAfter Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.\nSometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.\nOrcas that are kept in captivity often have bent dorsal fins.&quot;:85,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators. A long neck might help an animal get food from tall trees.&quot;:12,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.&quot;:15,&quot;Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.\nThe number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.&quot;:34,&quot;The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nOne type of convergent boundary is an ocean-ocean subduction zone, which forms when two plates with oceanic crust move toward each other. One of the plates subducts, or sinks, below the other.\nWhen one of the plates subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes in the ocean called a volcanic island arc.&quot;:2,&quot;The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell. The cell membrane also protects the cell from the outside environment.\nThe cytoplasm is made up of a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell membrane. The cytoplasm supports the other cell parts and holds them in place. Many important chemical reactions happen in the cytoplasm.\nThe mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that the cell can use.\nThe vacuoles store nutrients, such as sugar, in the cell. Vacuoles also store water and waste.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities. It does this by sending instructions to different parts of the cell.\nThe chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. In animal and plant cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus.&quot;:3,&quot;Statements of fact make claims that are based on research, observation, or experimentation. Facts can be proved with evidence.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was shorter than King Louis XVI.\nThis statement is a fact. The statement can be verified by researching and comparing the height of each man.\nStatements of opinion make claims that are based on personal judgments or perspectives. Opinions can be supported by evidence, but they cannot be definitively proved.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a better leader than King Louis XVI.\nThis statement is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a \&quot;better\&quot; leader, so the statement cannot be proved.&quot;:9,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.&quot;:50,&quot;Timelines are used to show when events happened. Timelines go from left to right. Events on the left happened earlier than events on the right.\nOn some timelines, dates are divided into two categories:\nDates that occurred before the year 1 CE are labeled BCE, or Before the Common Era. These dates are sometimes labeled BC, or Before Christ.\nDates that occurred in the year 1 CE or later are labeled CE, or Common Era. These dates are sometimes labeled AD, or Anno Domini, which means \&quot;in the year of the Lord.\&quot;&quot;:1,&quot;Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand\nSupply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up\nSupply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.&quot;:58,&quot;Scientists record climate data from places around the world. Precipitation, or rain and snow, is one type of climate data.\nA bar graph can be used to show the average amount of precipitation each month. Months with taller bars have more precipitation on average.&quot;:24,&quot;Evidence is information that tells you something happened.\nHow do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?\nThere are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.\nHere are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:\nCause of the change | Evidence of the change\nearthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs\nvolcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground\nerosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud\nBe careful when you are looking for evidence!\nA picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!\nFor example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.\n&quot;:12,&quot;Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?\nFirst, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.&quot;:11,&quot;Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.\nTo put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.\nIf one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.&quot;:365,&quot;Gymnosperms are plants that have seeds but not flowers. Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.\nMost conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.\nMale cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.\nThe fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again.&quot;:6,&quot;An environment includes all of the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment.\nThere are many different types of ecosystems. Here are some ways in which these ecosystems can differ from each other:\nthe pattern of weather, or climate\nthe type of soil or water\nthe organisms that live there&quot;:2,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.&quot;:16,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nVerbal irony involves saying one thing but implying something very different. People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.\nOlivia seems thrilled that her car keeps breaking down.\nEach breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face.&quot;:52,&quot;Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.\nPhotosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:\nThey are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.\nTheir cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.\nTheir chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.\nThey use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce.&quot;:8,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nPersonification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.\nThe trees danced in the wind.&quot;:8,&quot;Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.\nA vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.\nAn invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body.&quot;:54,&quot;All organisms need food. Food gives organisms the energy they need to survive.\nAnimals get their food by eating other organisms. An animal's digestive system breaks down food into small particles of fat, protein, sugar, and other nutrients. The blood carries these small particles to cells throughout the animal's body.\nInside cells, nutrient particles can be broken down to release energy. Cells need energy to do their jobs. A cell's job might include sending signals to other cells, rearranging chemicals to make new substances, or moving substances from place to place.\nCells also use nutrient particles as building materials. Cells use building materials to help the animal grow and to replace worn-out parts.&quot;:3,&quot;An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells.\nDifferent objects can have the same properties. You can use these properties to put objects into groups.&quot;:58,&quot;An environment includes all of the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment.\nThere are many different types of terrestrial, or land-based, ecosystems. Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other:\nthe pattern of weather, or climate\nthe type of soil\nthe organisms that live there&quot;:110,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.&quot;:17,&quot;Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.&quot;:115,&quot;Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?&quot;:162,&quot;To study air masses, scientists can use maps that show conditions within Earth's atmosphere. For example, the map below uses color to show specific humidity, a measurement of the amount of water vapor in the air.\nThe map's legend tells you the specific humidity level that each color represents. Colors on the left in the legend represent lower specific humidity levels than colors on the right. For example, areas on the map that are the darkest shade of purple have a specific humidity from zero grams per kilogram (g/kg) up to two g/kg. Areas that are the next darkest shade of purple have a specific humidity from two g/kg up to four g/kg.&quot;:18,&quot;Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.\nMost present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.\nTwo verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.\nPast tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.\nMost past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.\nSome verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.\nFuture tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.\nAll future-tense verbs use the word will.\nPresent | Past | Future\nwalk, walks | walked | will walk\ngo, goes | went | will go&quot;:163,&quot;A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.\nIn a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.\nThe original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.\nThe substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.\nSo, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.&quot;:19,&quot;Mammals have hair or fur and feed their young milk.&quot;:10,&quot;The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.&quot;:167,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound rubidium bromide.\nIn a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.&quot;:3,&quot;Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to make new plants. How do plants use their flowers to make new plants?\nFlowers make a powder called pollen. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. They can move pollen to the female part of the flower. Then, the pollen helps the flower grow seeds and fruit. Fruit grows around the seeds.\nLater, the seeds can fall out of the fruit. They can land on the ground. Then, the seeds can grow into new plants.&quot;:1,&quot;Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.\nHow do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.&quot;:54,&quot;Fish live underwater. They have fins, not limbs.&quot;:6,&quot;Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.\nAnaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.\nOut of the cradle endlessly rocking,\nOut of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,\nOut of the Ninth-month midnight\n—From Walt Whitman, \&quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking\&quot;\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n—From Alfred Noyes, \&quot;The Highwayman\&quot;\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n—From Mary Howitt, \&quot;The Voice of Spring\&quot;\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n—From Bayard Taylor, \&quot;A Night with a Wolf\&quot;\nAssonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.\nI wandered lonely as a Cloud\nThat floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host of golden Daffodils.\n—From William Wordsworth, \&quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\&quot;\nMeter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.\nA poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \&quot;The Eagle\&quot;\nA poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n—From Edgar Allen Poe, \&quot;The Raven\&quot;\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n—From Hilda Conkling, \&quot;The Old Bridge\&quot;\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.&quot;:9,&quot;Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.&quot;:53,&quot;An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.\n\&quot;I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!\&quot; Lila remarked.\nHere, Lila alludes to the fairy tale \&quot;Cinderella,\&quot; in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately.&quot;:132,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nWhether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.\nHere are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.\nIf opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.\nIf the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.\n&quot;:58,&quot;There are four kinds of sentences.\nA declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period.\nThe nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.\nAn imperative sentence makes a request or a demand and usually ends with a period. If a demand shows strong feeling, it can end with an exclamation point.\nFor this assignment, use references to support your claims.\nDon't drive so quickly in the construction zone!\nAn interrogative sentence asks a question and always ends with a question mark.\nGiven the recent critiques of her new strategic plan, do you think the CEO will reconsider the company's direction?\nAn exclamatory sentence is a statement that shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamation always ends with an exclamation point.\nI can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!&quot;:26,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nHyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.\nI ate so much that I think I might explode!&quot;:10,&quot;A food web is a model.\nA food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.\nArrows show how matter moves.\nA food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.\nAn organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.\nAn organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.&quot;:88,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?\nThe number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.\nTime is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour.&quot;:60,&quot;Fossils are preserved remains of the body parts or activities of ancient organisms.\nSome fossils show the body parts of organisms. Bones and shells are two body parts that are commonly preserved in fossils.\nSome fossils show traces of an organism's activities. Footprints and burrows are two examples of traces that can be preserved in fossils. A burrow is a hole dug by an animal.\nAll fossils are formed in nature. They take thousands of years to form.&quot;:1,&quot;An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.&quot;:24,&quot;A change in an object's temperature indicates a change in the object's thermal energy:\nAn increase in temperature shows that the object's thermal energy increased. So, thermal energy was transferred into the object from its surroundings.\nA decrease in temperature shows that the object's thermal energy decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred out of the object to its surroundings.&quot;:75,&quot;A fact is something that can be proved true by research or observation.\nGeorge Washington became president of the United States in 1789.\nThis statement is a fact. It can be proved by researching what year George Washington was inaugurated president.\nAn opinion is something that a person believes, thinks, or feels. An opinion can be supported by evidence, but it cannot be proved true.\nGeorge Washington was a better president than Thomas Jefferson.\nThis statement is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a \&quot;better\&quot; president, so the statement cannot be proved.&quot;:14,&quot;There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.\nThere is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.\nSurpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.\nWhen the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.\nWhen the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage.&quot;:12,&quot;Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.&quot;:26,&quot;A fact is something that can be proved to be true. Facts can be proved by observing, measuring, or studying information.\nThe flag of the United States has 13 stripes.\nThis is a fact. It can be proved by looking at the flag and counting the number of stripes.\nAn opinion is something that a person believes, thinks, or feels. An opinion cannot be proved true.\nThe flag of the United States is easy to draw.\nThis is an opinion. People may have different opinions about what makes a flag \&quot;easy\&quot; to draw.&quot;:27,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nAn allusion is a brief reference to something or someone well known, often from history or literature.\n\&quot;I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!\&quot; Lila remarked.&quot;:27,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nArms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly.&quot;:47,&quot;Connotation is the feeling or idea that goes along with a word or phrase. Some words are close in meaning but have different connotations.\nFor example, think about the words eager and impatient. They both mean wanting something to happen, but they have different connotations.\nEager has a positive connotation. It is a nice word. An eager person is happy and excited.\nImpatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding.&quot;:34,&quot;A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.\nWhen opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.\nWhen opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.&quot;:28,&quot;Oceans are huge bodies of salt water. The world has five oceans. All of the oceans are connected, making one world ocean.&quot;:65,&quot;Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.\nA simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.\nMy sister runs like a cheetah.\nThe sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.\nA cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.\nThe cat's fur was as dark as the night.\nThe cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.\nThe night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.\nA metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.\nThe snow formed a blanket over the town.\nThe snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.\nA blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.\nUsing similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.&quot;:47,&quot;Birds have feathers, two wings, and a beak.&quot;:11,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance zirconium.\nIn a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend.&quot;:3,&quot;Waste is material within an animal's body that it cannot use. If waste builds up in an animal's body, it will make the animal sick. So, the waste must be removed.\nExcretion and elimination are two ways waste can be removed from an animal's body.\n Waste that is made by an animal's cells is removed by the excretory system. The waste in a cell comes from the breakdown of nutrients. Cells break down nutrients and make many different chemicals. The animal uses most of these chemicals to stay healthy. But cells also make some chemicals that the animal does not need. The release of unneeded chemicals as waste is called excretion. \n Waste that is left over from food is removed by the digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food and takes in small nutrient particles. Some parts of the food are left over after the nutrients are absorbed. These parts are waste. The anus releases this waste from the body. The release of waste left over from food is called elimination.&quot;:1,&quot;Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.&quot;:30,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound potassium chloride.\nIn a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.&quot;:1,&quot;When you review a fellow student's writing, try to make your feedback clear and specific. You can use questions such as the following to guide your feedback:\nIdeas and development: Does the writer express a clear main idea and develop it with evidence, examples, and analysis?\nOrganization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that the ideas build on one another and are easy to follow?\nSentence fluency: Do the writer's sentences vary in structure and length, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?\nWord choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely, avoiding excessive repetition or inappropriate language to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?\nGrammar and mechanics: Does the writer use accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?&quot;:8,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.&quot;:36,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nWhen you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.\nThe tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.\nA red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.&quot;:68,&quot;Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions. Those directions are north, south, east, and west.\nA compass rose is a set of arrows that point to the cardinal directions. A compass rose usually shows only the first letter of each cardinal direction.\nThe north arrow points to the North Pole. On most maps, north is at the top of the map.&quot;:248,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nThese pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.&quot;:38,&quot;Animals increase their reproductive success when they have offspring that survive to reproduce.\nAnimals can increase their chances of having offspring by behaving in ways that help them get partners to mate and reproduce with. These partners are called mates. For example, animals may make special sounds, perform specific dances, or show off bright colors to attract mates. Animals may also compete with each other for mates.\nAnimals can increase the chances that their offspring will survive to reproduce by caring for and protecting them. For example, animals may feed their offspring or guard them from predators. These behaviors increase the chances that the offspring will survive to adulthood, when they can reproduce.\nMany behaviors can increase the chances that animals will have offspring that survive to reproduce. But the behaviors cannot guarantee that the animals will have greater reproductive success. Animals that attract or compete for mates won't always successfully mate and reproduce, and offspring that are fed and protected won't always survive to adulthood.&quot;:7,&quot;There are four kinds of sentences.\nA declarative sentence is a statement. It tells about something. A declarative sentence always ends with a period.\nI have an older brother and a younger sister.\nAn interrogative sentence is a question. It asks something. An interrogative sentence always ends with a question mark.\nHow tall are you?\nAn imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something. An imperative sentence usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.\nRead the first chapter by next week.\nLook out for that car!\nAn exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.\nSome whales are over ninety feet long!\nI can't wait until tomorrow!&quot;:56,&quot;Fossils are the remains of organisms that lived long ago. Scientists look at fossils to learn about the traits of ancient organisms. Often, scientists compare fossils to modern organisms.\nSome ancient organisms had many traits in common with modern organisms. Other ancient organisms were very different from any organisms alive today. The similarities and differences provide clues about how ancient organisms moved, what they ate, and what type of environment they lived in.\nBe careful when observing a fossil's traits!\nAs an organism turns into a fossil, many parts of its body break down. Soft parts, such as skin, often break down quickly. Hard parts, such as bone, are usually preserved. So, a fossil does not show all of an organism's traits.&quot;:7,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nA metaphor compares two things that are not actually alike without using like or as.\nThe snow formed a blanket over the town.&quot;:19,&quot;A thermometer is a tool that measures temperature. Temperature can be measured in degrees. The symbol for degrees is °.\nSome thermometers measure temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Celsius is one scale used to measure temperature.\nThis is a tube thermometer. It has a tube filled with a red liquid.\nThere is a Celsius scale along the right side of the tube. The top of the red liquid lines up with the number 30 on the scale. So, the temperature shown by this thermometer is 30°C.&quot;:5,&quot;An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it.&quot;:44,&quot;Although the Moon appears to shine, it does not give off light. Instead, we can see the Moon because it is lit up by the Sun. The part of the Moon that is both lit up by the Sun and facing Earth is called the Moon's phase.\nThe Moon orbits, or goes around, Earth. As it does, the Moon's phase changes. The model below shows the Moon's phase at eight positions in its orbit. The smaller moons closer to Earth show where sunlight hits the Moon. The larger moons farther from Earth show how the Moon will look during that phase.\nTo use the model, first pick one of the eight positions. Then, imagine standing on Earth and looking up at the Moon. Use the dotted white lines in the model to guide you. The picture of the Moon shows its phase for that position. If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, the Moon will appear flipped, left to right.&quot;:3,&quot;A thermometer is a tool that measures temperature. Temperature can be measured in degrees. The symbol for degrees is °.\nSome thermometers measure temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Fahrenheit is one scale used to measure temperature.\nThis is a tube thermometer. It has a tube filled with a red liquid.\nThere is a Fahrenheit scale along the right side of the tube. The top of the red liquid lines up with the number 80 on the scale. So, the temperature shown by this thermometer is 80°F.&quot;:9,&quot;In a title, capitalize the first word, the last word, and every important word in between.\nThe Wind in the Willows James and the Giant Peach\nThese words are not important in titles:\nArticles, a, an, the\nShort prepositions, such as at, by, for, in, of, on, to, up\nCoordinating conjunctions, such as and, but, or&quot;:64,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?\nThe number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.\nThere are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.\nThere are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard.&quot;:23,&quot;A trait is the way a living thing looks or acts. A habitat is the place where a living thing grows or lives.\nAn adaptation is a trait that helps a living thing stay alive in its habitat.&quot;:1,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nThese pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together.&quot;:42,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.&quot;:48,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.&quot;:47,&quot;A graphic organizer is a chart or picture that shows how ideas, facts, or topics are related to one another.\nWhen you read, look for graphic organizers included in the text. You can use these images to find key information. You can also create your own graphic organizers with information that you've read. Doing this can help you think about the ideas in the text and easily review them.\nWhen you write, you can use graphic organizers to organize your thoughts and plan your writing.&quot;:31,&quot;Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.&quot;:33,&quot;All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.&quot;:137,&quot;Animal cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in animal cells:\nMitochondria help the cell get the energy it needs. Mitochondria break down sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nAnimal cells also have organelles for storage and waste removal. The vacuoles store sugar and other nutrients. The lysosomes break down worn-out cell parts and other waste. Animal cells usually have several vacuoles and lysosomes.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell membrane is a thin layer that surrounds and protects the cell. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.&quot;:3,&quot;When you write, you can use sensory details. These sense words help your reader understand what something looks, sounds, tastes, smells, or feels like.\nSensory Category | Description\nSight | These are words like bright, clean, and purple. A reader can imagine looking at these details.\nSound | These are words like hissing, buzzing, and ringing. A reader can imagine hearing these details.\nTaste | These are words like juicy, sweet, and burnt. A reader can imagine tasting these details.\nSmell | These are words like fruity, sweet, and stinky. A reader can imagine smelling these details.\nTouch | These are words like fuzzy, wet, and soft. A reader can imagine feeling these details.\nMany sense words can describe more than one sense. For example, soft can describe a touch or a sound. And sweet can describe a taste or a smell.\n&quot;:10,&quot;Amphibians have moist skin and begin their lives in water.&quot;:10,&quot;Birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are groups of animals. Scientists sort animals into each group based on traits they have in common. This process is called classification.\nClassification helps scientists learn about how animals live. Classification also helps scientists compare similar animals.&quot;:52,&quot;Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.\nScientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\nA ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.\nThe balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.\nNotice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.\nIn chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.\nThe symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.&quot;:10,&quot;Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.\nFlowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.\nBoth the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.\nPollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.&quot;:3,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground.&quot;:50,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nVolume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.\nThere are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.\nThere are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.\nA raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.&quot;:53,&quot;A continent is one of the seven largest areas of land on earth.&quot;:32,&quot;Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?\nConifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.\nThe seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.&quot;:11,&quot;An organism's common name is the name that people normally call the organism. Common names often contain words you know.\nAn organism's scientific name is the name scientists use to identify the organism. Scientific names often contain words that are not used in everyday English.\nScientific names are written in italics, but common names are usually not. The first word of the scientific name is capitalized, and the second word is not. For example, the common name of the animal below is giant panda. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca.&quot;:62,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nA simile uses like or as to compare two things that are not actually alike.\nThe cat's fur was as dark as the night.&quot;:10,&quot;A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.\nMy friends walk along the path.\nA sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is usually missing a subject or a verb.\nKnows the answer.\nThis is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject.\nWho knows the answer? She knows the answer.\nThe bright red car.\nThis is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb.\nWhat did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped.\nA run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.\nI knocked on the door it opened.\nIt started raining, we ran inside.\nTo fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.\nI knocked on the door. It opened.\nIt started raining. We ran inside.\nYou can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nI knocked on the door, and it opened.\nIt started raining, so we ran inside.&quot;:39,&quot;Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.&quot;:44,&quot;A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nA logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:\nFallacy | Description\nad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself\nappeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice\nbandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice\ncircular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself\nguilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something\nA logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:\nFallacy | Description\nfalse causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other\nfalse dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist\nhasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations\nslippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences\nstraw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against\n&quot;:117,&quot;To study air masses, scientists can use maps that show conditions within Earth's atmosphere. For example, the map below uses color to show air temperatures.\nThe map's legend tells you the temperature that each color represents. Colors on the left in the legend represent lower temperatures than colors on the right. For example, areas on the map that are the darkest shade of blue have a temperature from -25°C up to -20°C. Areas that are the next darkest shade of blue have a temperature from -20°C up to -15°C.&quot;:20,&quot;A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Each force acts on an object in a certain direction. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, they are called opposing forces.&quot;:9,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nA euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.\nThe head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.&quot;:16,&quot;Plants and animals are living things. Living things are called organisms.\nPlants come in many shapes and sizes. Most plants grow in the ground. They might grow leaves, flowers, and fruit. Plants cannot move around on their own like animals can.\nAnimals also come in many shapes and sizes. Most animals can move around. Animals might run, swim, jump, or fly. Animals eat plants or other organisms for food.&quot;:61,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.\nMagnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).\nHere are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.\nWhether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.\nIf opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.\nIf the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.&quot;:63,&quot;Plant and animal cells have many parts in common, but not all. This table shows some of their similarities and differences.\nCell part | Plant cell | Animal cell\ncell wall | yes | no\ncell membrane | yes | yes\ncytoplasm | yes | yes\nmitochondria | yes | yes\nvacuole | yes | yes\nchloroplasts | yes | no\nnucleus | yes | yes\nchromosomes | yes | yes\nThink about how plant and animal cells are different:\nPlant cells have a cell wall, but animal cells do not. The cell wall helps plant cells keep a fixed shape. Most animal cells do not have a fixed shape.\nPlant cells have chloroplasts, but animal cells do not. Chloroplasts make sugar that plants cells can use as food. Animal cells cannot make their own food.\n&quot;:2,&quot;The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\ntransform boundary\nWhen the plates at a transform boundary slide past each other, they usually move in one of two ways. Either the plates move in opposite directions, or they move in the same direction but at different rates.\nThe boundary between the two plates is called a fault. When the two plates move suddenly, an earthquake can happen along the fault.&quot;:4,&quot;Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.&quot;:12,&quot;All substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent chemical bonds. Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.&quot;:9,&quot;During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:\nIdeas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?\nOrganization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?\nVoice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?\nSentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?\nWord choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?\nGrammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?&quot;:35,&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.\nA euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.\nThe head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.\nHyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.\nI ate so much that I think I might explode!\nAn oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.\nSome reviewers are calling this book a new classic.\nA paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.\nAlways expect the unexpected.&quot;:125,&quot;Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.&quot;:165,&quot;In the past, scientists classified living organisms into two groups: plants and animals. Over the past 300 years, scientists have discovered many more types of organisms. Today, many scientists classify organisms into six broad groups, called kingdoms.\nOrganisms in each kingdom have specific traits. The table below shows some traits used to describe each kingdom.\n | Bacteria | Archaea | Protists | Fungi | Animals | Plants\nHow many cells do they have? | one | one | one or many | one or many | many | many\nDo their cells have a nucleus? | no | no | yes | yes | yes | yes\nCan their cells make food? | some species can | some species can | some species can | no | no | yes&quot;:35,&quot;Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n&quot;:52,&quot;An animal's skeletal system provides a strong frame for its body. The skeletal system has three main jobs. First, it supports the animal's body. Second, it protects the organs and other soft parts inside the animal's body. Third, it works with the muscular system to help the animal move.\nSome animals have an endoskeleton. The word endoskeleton means \&quot;inside skeleton.\&quot; An endoskeleton is inside an animal's body. Many vertebrates have an endoskeleton. A vertebrate's endoskeleton is made up of bones and fibers called tendons and ligaments. Tendons connect muscles to bones, and ligaments connect bones to other bones.\nSome animals have an exoskeleton. The word exoskeleton means \&quot;outside skeleton.\&quot; An exoskeleton is made up of tough structures covering the outside of an animal's body. Many invertebrates have an exoskeleton. Stiff fibers attach the animal's muscles to its exoskeleton.&quot;:1,&quot;A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.\nAn independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.\nthe oranges on our tree are ripe\nThe clause can stand alone. It is independent.\nafter we pick up Kevin from work\nThe clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.\nA simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.\nBen and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.\nSome simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.\nIn the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.\nBen usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.\nA compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nWe saw a flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard the rumble of thunder.\nA complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction such as after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, or while.\nIf she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.&quot;:79,&quot;An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells.&quot;:51,&quot;Many maps of Earth use color to show different areas.\nGreen and brown show land that is not covered by water or ice.\nBlue shows liquid water in oceans, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water.\nWhite shows frozen water. These parts of Earth's surface are covered by ice.&quot;:1,&quot;Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.\nSedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.\nMetamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by heating and squeezing. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.&quot;:12,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nThese pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.&quot;:34,&quot;Some words are alike. They go together in a group.\nRed, blue, and green go together. They are colors.\nMom, dad, grandma, and grandpa go together. They are people in a family.&quot;:20,&quot;A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nA logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:\nFallacy | Description\nad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent\nappeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice\nbandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice\ncircular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself\nguilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something\nred herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim\nA logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:\nFallacy | Description\nfalse causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other\nfalse dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist\nhasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence\nstraw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against\n&quot;:101,&quot;Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen.\nPhotosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:\nThey are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Producers don't usually eat other organisms.\nTheir cells contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are cell parts where photosynthesis occurs.\nTheir chloroplasts often contain chlorophyll, which is green. Chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight to power photosynthesis.\nThey use the sugars they make during photosynthesis as food. This food provides the organisms with the energy they need to live.&quot;:5,&quot;Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?\nFirst, the male part of the flower makes a powder called pollen. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.\nAfter pollination, the flower can grow seeds and fruit. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.&quot;:1,&quot;When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.\nThis table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.\nType of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species...\nCommensal | benefits | is not significantly affected\nMutualistic | benefits | benefits\nParasitic | benefits | is harmed (but not usually killed)&quot;:10,&quot;A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to another. Every force has a direction.\nThe direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.\nThe direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.&quot;:15,&quot;A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.\nThe primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.&quot;:54,&quot;Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n&quot;:213,&quot;All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.&quot;:111,&quot;In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.&quot;:30,&quot;Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.&quot;:48,&quot;Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.&quot;:120,&quot;Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.\nFormal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.\nCompare the following sentences.\nInformal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.\nMore formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.\nMost formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.&quot;:63,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nMass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.\nThere are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.\nThere are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.\nA paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram.&quot;:58,&quot;When writing research papers, you will often be asked to follow a particular style guide for your citations.

If a work has an editor or a translator, this information must be added to the Works Cited entry using the appropriate abbreviation. \&quot;Ed.\&quot; stands for edited by. \&quot;Trans.\&quot; stands for translated by.\nMissing Information. If a work has no known author, the author section of the citation is simply left out. If a work has no available page numbers, the abbreviation \&quot;n. pag.\&quot; is used instead. If a work has no available publication date, the abbreviation \&quot;n.d.\&quot; is used instead. If a work has no available publisher or no available city of publication, the abbreviation \&quot;n.p.\&quot; is used instead.\n&quot;:22,&quot;Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.&quot;:185,&quot;An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators.&quot;:113,&quot;An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.\nA permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.\nThe function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.\nAn organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.&quot;:7,&quot;Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nMass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.\nThere are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.\nThere are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.\nSo, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.\nA slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.&quot;:51,&quot;There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.&quot;:60,&quot;To stay alive, animal cells must get water and oxygen. Animal cells also produce carbon dioxide, a waste that must be removed. An animal's respiratory and circulatory systems work together to do these jobs.\nAn animal's respiratory system is made up of organs that work together to bring in oxygen gas from the environment. The respiratory system also removes carbon dioxide gas from the animal's body. Some animals have lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air. Other animals have gills to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with water.\nAn animal's circulatory system is made up of organs that work together to move blood through its body. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels throughout the body. As blood moves through blood vessels, it delivers oxygen, nutrients from food, and water to cells. Blood also absorbs waste, including carbon dioxide. When the blood is pumped into the lungs or gills, it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen.&quot;:1,&quot;Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.\nSedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.\nMetamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.&quot;:18,&quot;One object can make another object move with a push or a pull.\nThe direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.\nThe direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.&quot;:7,&quot;Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.\nA vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.\nAn invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have a hard outer cover on their body. Other invertebrates have a soft body.&quot;:10,&quot;All living things need food and water. Water helps living things break down food and remove waste. Food gives living things energy. Living things use this energy to grow and change. All living things grow and change during their lives.\nAll living things sense changes in the world around them. Living things might sense changes by seeing, smelling, hearing, or feeling. Living things can respond to the changes they sense.&quot;:15,&quot;Words are made up of syllables. Two kinds of syllables are closed and open.\nA closed syllable has one vowel and ends with a consonant. It usually has a short vowel sound.\ndesk: short e\nkit / ten: short i / short e\nAn open syllable ends with one vowel. It usually has a long vowel sound.\ngo: long o\nhe / ro: long e / long o\nSome open syllables end with y. The y makes a long e sound or a long i sound.\nsky: long i\nba / by: long a / long e&quot;:12}}}},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;solution&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;:{&quot;column_name&quot;:&quot;solution&quot;,&quot;column_type&quot;:&quot;string_text&quot;,&quot;column_statistics&quot;:{&quot;nan_count&quot;:0,&quot;nan_proportion&quot;:0,&quot;min&quot;:0,&quot;max&quot;:2716,&quot;mean&quot;:246.72576,&quot;median&quot;:186,&quot;std&quot;:230.15784,&quot;histogram&quot;:{&quot;hist&quot;:[8390,2875,1143,232,66,11,2,2,1,4],&quot;bin_edges&quot;:[0,272,544,816,1088,1360,1632,1904,2176,2448,2716]}}}}],&quot;rows&quot;:[{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:0,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/derek-thomas/ScienceQA/--/default/train/0/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742926668&amp;Signature=0ajojRUuAbGD8pedhcjC~ofaRAiTfaKP9T~c5yZw2XxSZ654yZ0Fo1Nh-CpUJWC-mEygE6LrDVaYUOEh1NuM8~2T0WoW-9J5SiF7uu56jmWAG18HYt~phRlELSvQL~Q7hAao2wXxOdieMm3K93cpEMVs9V-Y0T6kJMn9JBNs-XZHa1yU2Kopp~Cg34hMcov6ToOLbRTOmNQSrQgTY13TxntE3yMLL4dXvWcQ2bENV7b9GH8~-53XTjsL6c0LnLu4Rf9GhheOffhpfXbv4RNK8UQz~94zbRsX-naRmmk85a73GvnHt3eJkcxlGAtsgbbIzffpdz153yLuNKYrmspykg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:750},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which of these states is farthest north?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;West Virginia&quot;,&quot;Louisiana&quot;,&quot;Arizona&quot;,&quot;Oklahoma&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;West Virginia\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Louisiana\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Arizona\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Oklahoma\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade2&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;social science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;geography&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Geography&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Read a map: cardinal directions&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions.

When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade8&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;biology&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Genes to traits&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?\nHow do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.\nIf both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.\nIf both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/derek-thomas/ScienceQA/--/default/train/7/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742926668&amp;Signature=nW8umHOeJ0gVbnLU0tjfI2~7QXJCZ3pGF6c1WwsHMfxUJg8vVXy3QkWki3IxghVNq4XGJmThSrO8wAmZR--6PZLF4k0d8P9E5o2WXh5pgMpBebyy8QDgGfyd8fF4-bxiSFI4Vdx~rR4tKu~ICjrhFmN9EE4YSkXd3ewLc9i7rERQg3wC7F4Ydr3CAtPNemrdLOc2bHcviOIAZ~c-NDcJobmWmwFKXJIzUa6hmK7awNf-54n6pKiSE6lKverMuyGA7x6C~lMfoIqqAoPzCcLQ6WmDwNyRAEicUJgZxbUra0zkA1mTNMSbspFmOZ4Ecj3aw~KNb-~6HVwkR4wgEdXzNw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:563},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You need to determine Holly's phenotype for the whisker type trait. First, consider the alleles in Holly's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nHolly's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Holly's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Select the solid.&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;rain&quot;,&quot;water in a fishbowl&quot;,&quot;hammer&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;rain\&quot;,\n  \&quot;water in a fishbowl\&quot;,\n  \&quot;hammer\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade2&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;physics&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;States of matter&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Identify solids and liquids&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Solid and liquid are states of matter.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which figure of speech is used in this text?\nHunter remarked that the new book on anti-gravity was impossible to put down.&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;alliteration&quot;,&quot;pun&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;alliteration\&quot;,\n  \&quot;pun\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade9&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;language science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;figurative-language&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Literary devices&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Classify figures of speech: review&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a hairy body or a hairless body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which object has more thermal energy?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;a cherry pie at a temperature of 90°F&quot;,&quot;a cherry pie at a temperature of 85°F&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;a cherry pie at a temperature of 90°F\&quot;,\n  \&quot;a cherry pie at a temperature of 85°F\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The objects are identical except for their temperatures.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade3&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;physics&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Heat and thermal energy&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How is temperature related to thermal energy?&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Based on this information, what is Bambi's genotype for the coat color gene?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;a black coat&quot;,&quot;LL&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;a black coat\&quot;,\n  \&quot;LL\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat.

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You need to determine Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait. First, consider the alleles in Squirt's genotype for the tail spots gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nSquirt's genotype of Ii has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Select the reptile.&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;eagle ray&quot;,&quot;dwarf crocodile&quot;,&quot;California newt&quot;,&quot;harbor seal&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;eagle ray\&quot;,\n  \&quot;dwarf crocodile\&quot;,\n  \&quot;California newt\&quot;,\n  \&quot;harbor seal\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade5&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;biology&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Classification&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Identify mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Reptiles have scaly, waterproof skin.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:61,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/derek-thomas/ScienceQA/--/default/train/61/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742926668&amp;Signature=MZakQ~YUeE7cBwWoo7UT2Vn59AB0Olm6hG3tSTFy1hZyg12O~Zl5qWNqDUqwliwYDW000gg1bRRNpD~YGAugPj7gLjhoMmSwCbGxZG~5~nVfTeRiEJtrr2iaGJj-R89qe~TR1PNxr1D1Y12k071YQlnJZAPmG2cnF6QtsDiJNpKSa6W997cib0RIDa3KmRtod~NL8K4iQYzQiLRNwftLPC9C0ENziXiRFhp-xnGctD4tazxXLAZF5gVx6-6R5cFz9UkWMHG2NSHnfaOyIyTM9fUY5CNOBSpaYgL02Gzt4Fw-6q0WDgmBuPWDKDG1KqIHJ2-SDDzN16~xy-byhCqHWg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:202,&quot;width&quot;:202},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which animal's feet are also adapted for swimming?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;blue-footed booby&quot;,&quot;tokay gecko&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;blue-footed booby\&quot;,\n  \&quot;tokay gecko\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;s spend much of their lives at sea.

This is called fertilization.\nThe fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Zazu's genotype for the cheek color gene is RR. Zazu's genotype of RR has only R allelles. The R allele is for bright orange cheeks. So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Zazu's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for pale orange cheeks (r) is recessive to the allele for bright orange cheeks (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.\nZazu's genotype of RR has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:76,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/derek-thomas/ScienceQA/--/default/train/76/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742926668&amp;Signature=ElVP8qqX1FL0It-ST9Bo9SbnR3yJy01SEaoFvvvIOFmzGfbp1ItJ5SvJY32vpVNHbeg1jCym3a1XBlnJx~wRFBOH8RBrhLNCFHy~bVVGp6bHdoIGkwCJxriUbpJqd2wx0cl~q9ihJm7624oMw43xvYLCr44FT~Erf6Nbje~pEEYAGA25~wO1T8rRmLB-jah8oY6HRucTqrnJTguUDCdjwYqoQG2n8hSoPpPEV4MlNUzMW6rjDRNU4OAeCAGq9Jl4T-3FExb0u-AEYn3-ionWtSYSHM7drE2PnihTwSh1Gz2t73aCIsMo1vn2Rk2fuooCaJI3fJfuk8WdQPxGR1CExQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:460,&quot;width&quot;:560},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Complete the statement.\nPalladium is ().&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;a compound&quot;,&quot;an elementary substance&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;a compound\&quot;,\n  \&quot;an elementary substance\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The model below represents palladium.

For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper.\nIn a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Select the vertebrate.&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;redback spider&quot;,&quot;common octopus&quot;,&quot;birdwing butterfly&quot;,&quot;asp viper&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;redback spider\&quot;,\n  \&quot;common octopus\&quot;,\n  \&quot;birdwing butterfly\&quot;,\n  \&quot;asp viper\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Hint: Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are vertebrates.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade5&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;biology&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Classification&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Identify vertebrates and invertebrates&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.\nA vertebrate has a backbone.

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Cody wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.\nFigure: a weather station.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade6&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;science-and-engineering-practices&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Engineering practices&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Evaluate tests of engineering-design solutions&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:92,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which is a complete sentence?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;In summer, insects always fly around the pond.&quot;,&quot;A bag of beans.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;In summer, insects always fly around the pond.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;A bag of beans.\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade3&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;language science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;writing-strategies&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sentences, fragments, and run-ons&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on?&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought.

We ran inside.\nYou can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence.

Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.\nScientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\nA ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.\nThe balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.\nEvery element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.\nSo, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.&quot;},&quot;solution&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. F is the symbol for fluorine. According to the legend, fluorine atoms are shown in light green. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and F. There is one hydrogen atom, so H will not have a subscript. There is one fluorine atom, so F will not have a subscript. The correct formula is HF. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:94,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;unsupported&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Not supported with pagination yet&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which metal paper clip has less thermal energy?&quot;},&quot;choices&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;the colder metal paper clip&quot;,&quot;the hotter metal paper clip&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;the colder metal paper clip\&quot;,\n  \&quot;the hotter metal paper clip\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;hint&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Two metal paper clips are identical except for their temperatures.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;closed choice&quot;},&quot;grade&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;grade6&quot;},&quot;subject&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;natural science&quot;},&quot;topic&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;physics&quot;},&quot;category&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Thermal energy&quot;},&quot;skill&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?&quot;},&quot;lecture&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.

The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

Tom placed a ping pong ball in a catapult, pulled the catapult's arm back to a 45° angle, and launched the ball. Then, Tom launched another ping pong ball, this time pulling the catapult's arm back to a 30° angle. With each launch, his friend Justin measured the distance between the catapult and the place where the ball hit the ground. Tom and Justin repeated the launches with ping pong balls in four more identical catapults. They compared the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 45° angle to the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 30° angle.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?</span></div></div>

Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4</span></div></div>

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.</span></div></div>

Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.</span></div></div>

Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.</span></div></div>

Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.</span></div></div>

First, consider the alleles in Holly's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Holly's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Holly's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers.</span></div></div>

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.</span></div></div>

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.</span></div></div>

Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that tungsten carbide is composed of carbon atoms and tungsten atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that tungsten carbide is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and tungsten. Since tungsten carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, tungsten carbide is a compound.</span></div></div>

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a hairy body or a hairless body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.
A hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body.</span></div></div>

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?</span></div></div>

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!</span></div></div>

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.</span></div></div>

A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Pam was using steel to make rusted sculptures. After building each sculpture, she caused the steel in the sculpture to rust by placing it into a tub filled with salt water for eight hours. Pam wondered if steel would rust faster submerged in vinegar instead of salt water.
To find out, Pam cut ten squares of steel sheet metal and split them into two equal groups. She put one group of squares into a tub filled with salt water and the other group of squares into a tub filled with vinegar. Once an hour for eight hours, Pam counted the number of rusted steel squares in each group.
Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.</span></div></div>

When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">You need to determine Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait. First, consider the alleles in Squirt's genotype for the tail spots gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Squirt's genotype of Ii has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail.</span></div></div>

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!</span></div></div>

Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.
Most conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.
Male cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.
The fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.</span></div></div>

Zazu's genotype of RR has only R allelles. The R allele is for bright orange cheeks. So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.
To check this answer, consider whether Zazu's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for pale orange cheeks (r) is recessive to the allele for bright orange cheeks (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Zazu's genotype of RR has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.</span></div></div>

Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.</span></div></div>

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.</span></div></div>

A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.
Concrete hardening is a chemical change. The chemicals in the concrete react with each other to form a different type of matter. The new matter is hard and strong.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.</span></div></div>

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.

Haiti claims to own Navassa Island, which is a disputed territory. In other words, multiple countries or groups claim that the area rightfully belongs to them.
Navassa Island is also claimed by the United States. The United States claimed the island in 1857 and has controlled it since then.

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Cody was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Cody wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.
So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.</span></div></div>

A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. F is the symbol for fluorine. According to the legend, fluorine atoms are shown in light green. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and F. There is one hydrogen atom, so H will not have a subscript. There is one fluorine atom, so F will not have a subscript. The correct formula is HF. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.</span></div></div>

The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.</span></div></div>

		Curation Rationale

</h3>
<p>When answering a question, humans utilize the information available across different modalities to synthesize a consistent and complete chain of thought (CoT). This process is normally a black box in the case of deep learning models like large-scale language models. Recently, science question benchmarks have been used to diagnose the multi-hop reasoning ability and interpretability of an AI system. However, existing datasets fail to provide annotations for the answers, or are restricted to the textual-only modality, small scales, and limited domain diversity. To this end, we present Science Question Answering (ScienceQA).</p>

<p>Questions in the ScienceQA dataset are sourced from open resources managed by IXL Learning,
an online learning platform curated by experts in the field of K-12 education. The dataset includes
problems that align with California Common Core Content Standards. To construct ScienceQA, we
downloaded the original science problems and then extracted individual components (e.g. questions,
hints, images, options, answers, lectures, and solutions) from them based on heuristic rules.
We manually removed invalid questions, such as questions that have only one choice, questions that
contain faulty data, and questions that are duplicated, to comply with fair use and transformative
use of the law. If there were multiple correct answers that applied, we kept only one correct answer.
Also, we shuffled the answer options of each question to ensure the choices do not follow any
specific pattern. To make the dataset easy to use, we then used semi-automated scripts to reformat
the lectures and solutions. Therefore, special structures in the texts, such as tables and lists, are
easily distinguishable from simple text passages. Similar to ImageNet, ReClor, and PMR datasets,
ScienceQA is available for non-commercial research purposes only and the copyright belongs to
the original authors. To ensure data quality, we developed a data exploration tool to review examples
in the collected dataset, and incorrect annotations were further manually revised by experts. The tool
can be accessed at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://scienceqa.github.io/explore.html">https://scienceqa.github.io/explore.html</a>.</p>
