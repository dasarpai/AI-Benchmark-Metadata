She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”\nHigh-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\nThe strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\nThe strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\nTasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.\nHe said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”\nThis project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.\nSee a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.\nFor more information on the berry industries, refer to the Horticulture Statistics Handbook and the Strategic Investment Plans for strawberries, raspberries and blackberries.

In some areas, Self-supply sources offer important added values such as water for productive use, income generation, family safety and improved food security.\n- Sustainability of services from Self-supply is high as there is strong ownership by people investing in own sources.\n- As Self-supply sources are shared sources, many people, including poor and vulnerable households, benefit from investments in Self-supply, often at no costs. This means that Self-supply can be effective in reaching the hard-to-reach.\n- For millions of people in rural areas of Africa, supported Self-supply will be the most cost effective service delivery model to provide access to safe water. This also includes those parts of the population which actually have poor access as they e.g. cannot afford water from communal supplies.\n- However, in areas where external support for Self-supply is lacking, only marginal improvements can usually be achieved, and the quality of services is lower than in areas where a dedicated support effort was made.\nCosts and business model for supported Self-supply\n- In many rural contexts, supported Self-supply is the most cost effective approach for water service delivery. However, as it is not applicable in all contexts, a blended approach combining communal water supply and supported Self-supply models should be followed.\n- Based on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis of different service delivery approaches, the LCC for communal supplies are about 40 US$/capita served in the study countries, whereas the LCC for supported Self-supply is about 10 U$/capita.\n- In sparsely populated areas, communal supplies (e.g. handpumps) are even more costly (up to 100 U$/capita served) as only few people can be served with one additional unit. Serving all rural people with communal supply is therefore not financially viable.\n- Considering the applicability of Self-supply technologies, in Zambia and Zimbabwe, the cost saving of following a blended approach using both communal supplies and supported Self-supply is almost 50% of the total LCC for reaching 100% of the population by 2030. These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US$ in Zambia and more than 260 million US$ in Zimbabwe.\nSupport services needed\n- Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply, so it is not about a particular technology.\n- Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation, which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water. However, supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties: Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally.\n- To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement, capacity development at all levels, M&amp;E and technical support, reliable funding and learning and sharing.\n- Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further, particularly in remote rural areas.\n- There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme, it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact.\n- Hygiene promotion, including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS), is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services, including Self-supply water sources.\n- The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply. Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model, such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone, and in Ethiopia, Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level.\nMore Information\n» Review of Self-supply and its support services in African countries: Synthesis Report).&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some of the benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources include convenience, less time spent for fetching water and access to more and better quality water.

It has many unique features, gives you the best mobile twitter experience you never imagined before.\nThe first unique feature is Real-Time.\nYou can’t find any refresh button in this app, because you absolutely don’t need to. Every time you open it, you’ll get the latest tweets and while you’re reading, you’ll get incoming tweets in Real-Time. So if your friend mentioned you, you can reply instantly.\nThe second unique feature is Avatar Indicator.\nAvatar Indicator is small avatars showed on the title bar to indicate that you’ve got new message/tweet/mention. Since it’s real-time, you’ll keep getting incoming tweets while you’re reading your older timeline, Avatar-Indicator will let you know who’s tweet you’ve just got, and decide whether to check it out right away.\nThe third unique feature is Direct Link\nI think it is obviously the most intuitive and convenient way to open a link. When you want to open a link, just click it in the time line . You can also click a username to open a profile window, click a hash tag to open a search result window. Different kind of links displayed in different colors, you can change it to whatever color you like.\nThe fourth unique feature is Smart Bookmark\nHave you ever experienced this scenario? When you are reading your home timeline, the app notified you that you’ve got some new tweets, you click “go-to-top” button to read the newest tweets, and then you want to get back to the previous position to continue your reading. How can you do this? In other twitter clients you have to scroll down all the way to find where you were, a lot of time wasted. But in this app, “go-to-top” button will appear when you scrolling up, click it, you can got to top, read the newest tweets. After that when you scrolling down, Smart Bookmark button will appear at the corner. Click it, you can get back to exactly where you were.\nThe fifth unique feature is User Level Notification\nNotification for all your new tweets is meaningless, if you following more than a few users, you’ll get new tweets all the time.

The question is simple, the answer is not.\nFor some 60 years, the only reliable information about India’s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).\nFor all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India’s population. India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries (that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s). But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it.\nBut the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics: NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth, and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India’s fast growth. This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton, Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, T.N. Srinivasan, S. Subramanian, Martin Ravallion and many others. Several representative articles are given here and here and here.\nThe gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes. The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean (presumably reflected in GDP per capita) and if surveys continued, partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate, to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution, that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts.\nAnd if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.\nAnd indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India’s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.\n/>\nBut until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.\nAnd the results are very different from NSS’s. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini’s calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India’s inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.\nFor 2011, I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile (note that these are entirely different people though), the results do make sense. For the lowest percentiles, consumption is about twice income, and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income (which you would expect in a poor environment). After that point, consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income (that is, there is saving), so much that among the top 5%, income is twice as high as consumption (saving rate is 50%). Overall, the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS, and as we have said, Gini is some 15 points higher.\nThis “reasonableness” of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.\nSo if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.\nThere are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.\nAs mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?\nWrong.\nWhat happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.\nIn conclusion, more unequal but richer India, makes the world more equal.\nNote: Only a member of this blog may post a comment.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The main difference between the NSS and the IHDS in terms of measuring India's inequality is that the NSS focused on consumption, that is, how much people actually consume, while the IHDS is based on income. The NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth and higher poverty, while the IHDS revealed a higher level of inequality, similar to Latin American countries.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Gunnar Nelson took his time on the feet against Zak Cummings tonight in the co-main event of UFC Fight Night 46, but when he finally saw an opportunity to switch up the gears in the second round he pounced on it, taking his opponent to the mat, seizing his back and locking in the fight-ending choke almost effortlessly.\nRound One:\nNelson in his usual Karate style stance keeps out of range of Cummings early strikes. Then he presses into the clinch, but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position. As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee.\nNelson lands a right hook. he misses with an overhand. Nelson very relaxed, but he’s very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough. A right hand counter lands for Nelson, but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up. Nelson turns though and then breaks away from the clinch.\nA head kick is blocked by Cummings. Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds. Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body. More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch. Nothing doing and they back up. However, Cummings then comes back in and does finally land a few nice punches while Nelson has his back against the cage. Not for long though as Nelson circles out and that’s the final action of the round.\nRound Two:\nNelson biding his time in the opening minute of the second as Cummings continually tries to land strikes, but generally comes up short. however, Cummings does back him up against the cage and unleash a flurry that foces Nelson to clinch.\nThey stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage. Not much volume in Nelson’s striking so far this round, but he does land a speedy right hand that clearly hits the mark. Certainly better accuracy from him, but a little more offense wouldn’t go astray.\nAgain he finds a home for a clinical right hand. He starts to close the distance more now, but remains patient and just snaps off another quick right.\nInto clinch range and Nelson reaches for a guillotine choke and goes to the mat with it. He fluidly switches on to Cummings back. He lands a few punches and then swiftly locks in a rear-naked choke.\nImpressive stuff from Nelson in the way he was able to transition so slickly to his dangerous ground game and he forces Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How did Gunnar Nelson win the fight against Zak Cummings at UFC Fight Night 46?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Gunnar Nelson won the fight against Zak Cummings at UFC Fight Night 46 by taking his opponent to the mat, seizing his back and locking in a rear-naked choke, forcing Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The prices indicated in this catalogue do not include shipping costs.\nFabiana Filippi's shirts and blouses are the perfect base to create solid modern and refined looks thanks to their innate ability to be easily matched to different shapes, fabrics and colours. \&quot;Must-have\&quot; items in the wardrobe, always able to confer impeccable elegance.

Then, a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode.\nDan Foley, the latest contestant voted off the island, says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain’s edit. But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been.\nSo what did we miss? Foley, a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine, was happy to tell us.\nOkay, there are going to be some tough questions today, but let’s start with an easy one: what could you have done differently to keep from going home?\nYou know, it’s easy to be an armchair quarterback. If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol, I would have voted out Sierra.\nYou used your extra vote during the tribal council. Do you think that made you a target?\nI said it before: superfans can’t do basic math. It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left. I wanted to play it when there was an even number. And what you didn’t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me. And then during Tribal Council, Will said, “If Dan has the advantage, he should use it.” It was the right time to play it.\nFair enough. So what was your reaction when you were voted out? Were you angry at Carolyn?\nLook, anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn’t play the game. I left that game with a fever of expletives. They didn’t show it, but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed. I was absolutely furious, calling Mike every name in the book. But I don’t wish anyone ill will.\nOkay, I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win.\nThey don’t.\nThey do.\nNo they don’t. Tony Vlachos was a backstabber, not a flipper.\nOkay, but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice. She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10. Then, at Final 9, she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance.\nBut did she win?\nYes. She won the million. She beat Neleh Dennis.\nHuh. Okay.\nAnd Sandra Diaz Twine flipped multiple times to win.\nWell, Sandra is a different case altogether. But Cochran flipped, and did that work for him?\nNo. No one says that all flippers don’t win. But flippers can and do win. Also, there was Danni Boatwright in Guatemala…\n(Laughs) Yes, she played a good game. But I still believe that flippers don’t win. I really do.\nOkay, let’s move on to the ugliness of the season. Your character was very difficult to root for.\nI talked to Jeff Probst the other day and I ripped him a new one. I said, “You did me wrong. You did me dirty. You screwed me on my edit. You made me look like a piece of s—.” And Jeff said, “How do you figure?” And I said, “You cherry-picked things to show, sometimes out of context.”\nGet a Tour of Jeff Probst’s ‘Spectacular’ Pad\nI don’t know you. I only know the edited version of you. Are you saying that it was incorrect?When I am pushed, I push back. And I was pushed a lot. They didn’t show that. Lindsey, Sierra … they said things to me and pushed back. Look, I was always the fat guy. I learned how to stand up for myself. But you didn’t see what other people were saying or doing.\nYou took a lot of heat for your comments to Shirin.\nLook, there’s not a single person on this season who didn’t say derogatory things about Shirin. Even Mike called her a man-hater. I made an unfortunate comment about slapping her. I had no idea about her past. None. Zero. I would never have made that comment. I apologize for saying it.\nBut at the same time, my comment was not meant literally. I meant it figuratively. How many times do you hear people say, “I could kill him.” Are they really plotting to kill someone? Of course not.\nSo where do things stand with Shirin now?\nThe truth of the matter is that we don’t get along. I don’t wish her ill or badly, and I hope nothing but the best for her. I hope that if she wants to go back on Survivor again, she gets that shot. There are things in her past that continue to haunt her to this day, and I hope that she gets the help that she clearly needs.\nYou were a big Survivor fan. Now that your reputation has taken a hit, are you still a fan of the show?\nMy reputation has not been harmed. The people who know me know that my edit was not who I really am. I don’t have a problem telling the truth. There are people who love me, and people who hate me. There is no real middle ground. the people who hate me can’t handle the truth.\nBut do you still love the show, or has your view been tainted?\nHow can you not have a tainted vision when you pull back the curtain and see that Oz is pulling on the levers? I’m a little disappointed, but I still love the show. Would I play it again? (Long Pause) Yeah.

As per usual, we ate our share of fun ballpark food, so we’ll have a little snack at most for dinner.\nWhile Kim has a meeting at the New York Junior League on Monday, Tony will be out for dinner with his buddies, so Kim will be on her own once she gets home. While our dinner plans are different, we’ll probably have the same thing for lunch: The New York Times’ Green Garlic Tabbouleh. Kim made tabbouleh a few weeks go, but this recipes gives things a fun twist by using spring garlic, which is in season right now, but not for much longer.\nKim is going to a lecture Tuesday night and Tony will probably end up working late, so we’ll either meet up somewhere for dinner or just meet at home and order in. On Wednesday, Tony will be having dinner at a work event, so Kim will be on her own. Again, different dinners, same lunch, in this case The Minimalist Baker’s 30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry. We’ve found that despite Lent being long over, we’re still skewing pretty vegetarian/pescatarian, and this dish fits the bill, though Tony may add a little chicken to it to mix things up.\nKim will be back at the New York Junior League on Thursday, so Tony will be on his own for dinner. On Friday, we’re going to an event organized by Tony’s university alumni organization: an exhibit of the works of Robert Ryman to be held at the Dia:Chelsea on West 22nd Street. We’ve had a lot of fun at previous alumni events, so we’re looking forward to this one.

Author and motivational coach Nick Pavlidis, however, uses that mental image to deliver wise, honest, and hilariously self-deprecating stories revolving around the point when he realized that he was far from the ideal husband he’d thought himself to be.\nNick tackles an assortment of marital problems with the ease and expertise of a man who has spent one too many nights on a lumpy couch (and isn’t ashamed to admit it). On Confessions of a Terrible Husband: Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch, he shares his stumbles and challenges as a husband (which he jestingly calls “moron purgatory”), infused with advice from qualified relationship experts.\nAnd yes, he will gladly help you pronounce his last name properly.\nSavage Lovecast with Dan Savage\nThe name of this podcast works on so many levels. Not only does author and public speaker Dan Savage host the Savage Lovecast, but the subjects it deals with are also… savage, for lack of a better word.\nSince 2006, Dan has been dishing out real talk on dating, sex, and love (even way before #realtalk or podcasts were a thing).\nWhether it’s standard relationship stuff or more taboo topics that would make your parents and grandparents blush, Dan’s definitely got something substantial to say, delivered in an unapologetic and entertaining manner.\nYour Turn!\nThese five love and relationship podcasts cover most if not all of the bases when it comes to romance, friendships, family, and the other interpersonal aspects of our day-to-day lives. Sure, it’s nice to have people to listen to us when we have relationship woes. You’ll find, though, that being on the listening end can be quite helpful, too — perhaps, even more than you may realize.\nAre you in love with podcasts on relationships?

Over the race's first two days, the 365 athletes from 20 nations have competed in temperatures reaching 104 degrees, riding horses, mountain bikes, and riverboards in the Green River, trekking across the desert, and hiking through Utah's notorious slot canyons. The lead teams have covered roughly 200 miles; the teams at the back of the field are more than 75 miles behind. Gordon Wright sends us this from the race course.\nThis year's Primal Quest is so hot, so hard, and so long that race organizers have been largely concerned with what could go wrong. While heat stroke, dehydration and horseback riding injuries are relatively rare in most adventure races, they are real concerns in this one, as well as the more common issues such as injuries, exhaustion and logistical challenges.\nThis anxiety has been largely mitigated by the fitness of the competitors and the planning of the race staff. Astonishingly, only two teams have dropped out: Team Utah and Team xxTreme US. Both drop-outs bring surprises: Team Utah would seem to have a home-town advantage, but quit due to blisters and exhaustion. Team xxTreme US is largely comprised of Navy SEALs — notably hard men who were undone by injury.\n\&quot;I don't think you could reasonably take 400 people off the streets — or even out of a gym — stick them in the desert for two days and expect them to survive,\&quot; said Primal Quest Course Director Don Mann. \&quot;But these athletes are so fit they're not only surviving but making good progress.\&quot;\nAmid all the concern over the extraordinary heat and the capriciousness of the horses, a race broke out. Four teams ran and paddled neck and neck all throughout Day Two, never getting separated by more than twelve minutes. Among the leaders is Team Nike/Powerblast, the odds-on favorite led by defending champions Mike Kloser and Ian Adamson. Two teams led by women are also among the leaders: Team Merrill/Wigwam, captained by Robyn Benincasa and Team Spyder, captained by Danelle Ballangee.\nWhat makes that top grouping interesting isn't just that they're led by women, but that Benincasa and Ballangee are former teammates of Kloser and Adamson. The reasons for Ballangee and Benincasa leaving their male teammates and starting their own teams are many, and while the racers proffer respect, hard feelings remain.\nThere is still more than 200 miles of racing to go - and the lead teams have logged only four to six hours sleep in more than three days. But what is clear is that the ghosts of teammates past are dogging Team Nike, and it doesn't look like they're going away any time soon.\nFarther back in the pack, the pace was more stately, and the camaraderie much more present. Team Pedro's Boulders was preparing to launch its kayaks into the Green River for 35-mile paddling leg when field correspondent Bob Heady caught up to them.\nIona MacKenzie was stuffing her backpack into her kayak's hatch and painfully recalling Sunday's horseback section. Her horse stepped on her foot and broke a toe; she didn't realize the seriousness of the injury until the beginning of the eight-mile riverboarding segment. She was 108 miles into the race, and she couldn't pull her swim fin on.\nMacKenzie's teammate Charlie Kharsa gave her one of his fins, which was a couple of sizes bigger, and that \&quot;solved\&quot; MacKenzie's problem.\nKharsa now had one fin that was two sizes smaller than his foot, but if anyone in the race could shrug it off, it's Kharsa, who several years ago completed a riverboard voyage down the length of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.\nTeam Semper Fi was also transitioning from riverboard to kayak. A group of U.S. Marine officers, the team has already made a large impression on the race. Blowing away stereotypes, the Marines are far from taciturn and decidedly not buttoned-up. In fact, they seem to be having a blast amid all the misery. One of the team members entered the riverboarding segment by tossing his board into the Green, sprinting down the beach, and hopping onto it for an impressive display of skim-boarding.\nBrian Chontosh, who was awarded the Navy Cross for valor in Iraq in 2003, is reveling in a challenge that doesn't involve being shot at. Chontosh and teammate Kevin Saunders are both captains, and therefore lower-ranked than married team members Majors Sarah Fullwood and James Fullwood. When asked whether or not he and Saunders were getting along with their superiors, Chontosh joked, \&quot;We don't want to be anywhere near them — Kevin and I paddle together and plot against them.\&quot;\nThis joking, fun-loving attitude has become a trademark for a group of competitors who, despite the gravity of their occupation, do not take themselves seriously. Chontosh also asked Heady to send a message to front-running Team Nike/Powerblast, \&quot;We've been taking it easy for a couple of days — and we're about to put the hammer down.\&quot;\nThe merry Marines paddled away, 62 miles behind Nike, but with tremendous spirit.\nSemper Fi.\nStay with Adventure Beat for the latest from somewhere in Utah's desert stretches.\nAverage (Not Rated)&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which two teams dropped out of the Primal Quest Utah race and what were their reasons for doing so?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The two teams that dropped out of the Primal Quest Utah race were Team Utah and Team xxTreme US. Team Utah quit due to blisters and exhaustion, while Team xxTreme US, which was largely comprised of Navy SEALs, had to withdraw due to injury.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:11,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Wednesday’s word of the day, quantum (from Wordsmith.org) illustrates, in one word, my perception of time lately: there isn’t much of it.\nInstead of crafting a quick story for a Wednesday’s Word post, I searched for a quote that might give color to the word. I found one that indirectly speaks to my desire to write and the courage it takes to keep me writing, even when the inspiration flickers out.\nToday’s word:\nquantum. noun.\n1. A quantity or amount.\n2. A portion.\n3. A large amount.\n4. The smallest amount of something that can exist independently.\n, American business owner, career counselor, author.\nA new year approaches. And,2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.\nDon’t just imagine, Someday I’d like to be a writer.\nWrite.\nBecause “anything worth doing is worth doing…” now.\nInteresting that you consider it courageous to keep writing even when you’re not inspired. I’ve never thought of writing as courageous … well, not fiction writing. I want to know more of your viewpoint.\nI read that quote and immediately thought about the risk in writing.\nFor years I wanted to call myself a writer; I wanted to take the plunge. But I never ventured outside of my journal or a few personal letters that recounted a silly experience.\nStarting a blog was taking a risk. Submitting my first piece (in it’s own infancy) was taking a risk.\nIt would be easy to imagine the smile on my face when that first novel is finished and published, instead of actually rewriting that novel to submittable quality. And, then sending it out into the query world.\nAnd, I thought of your recent post (), and how even when I feel uninspired or unrecognized (with just one more rejection email to archive), I still write.\nI’m in a weird mood, I guess, or maybe I’m completely missing your point, but I’m not being flippant.\nIs what you feel you’re risking only the rejection of your work? I know it’s hard not to feel like a conjoined twin with your writing, but I’ve finally accepted that agents and editors are just businessmen and my work is only a product to them.\nI realize, of course, for a writer who has to make a living from her writing, selling the product is extremely important. I don’t have to sell my work, so I’ve come to the point where I view the act of writing, the creation of story, as the valuable part … not the selling. So, in that sense, writing is not a risk to me.\nI would like to share it, and so I will try to sell it, but if I never succeed, it does not diminish the accomplishment of writing a novel (or story), nor does that make me enjoy my work less.\nI don’t think you’re being flippant. Maybe I’m not expressing myself well.\nFor me, the risk in writing comes in the act itself: to write is to make myself vulnerable, whether I write memoir or fiction, since each story I write reveals a small part of myself or my psyche.\nThe risk also comes in sharing that story (and that small piece of myself) with others, whether they pay to read it or not.\nI hope that reads more clear than my first comment.\nHa ha, you were clear. I was trying to let you know I didn’t want you to think I was being flippant in the comment I was about to make.\nI guess a year ago I felt like you. I’ve had enough experience in critique groups now that I don’t think of it as a risk to share my work. But I think I feel more separated from my work than you do.\nChristi, I also feel the act of writing takes courage. For me, writing (including fiction writing) is often a painful, fearful experience. What I fear isn’t so much that others will reject me but that I will reject the parts of myself exposed in the writing process.\nTo be honest, I never thought, Someday I’d like to be a writer. Instead, I thought, Someday I’d like to stop lying to myself. A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.\n“2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.” Yes, and I like the clarity in this statement.\nAnn, I love this: A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.\nEarning the right to say so aloud hits home with me.

Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress that anti-Muslim instructional materials hurt the country’s fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. As a result of this mentality, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to collect counterterrorism training materials at all military academies and academic centers such as the National Defense Intelligence College and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center.\n“The goal, evidently, is to banish any material that could be viewed as offensive to Muslims,” said the JW blog.\nTo fulfill this politically-correct mission, the FBI enlisted the Army Combating Terrorism Center at West Point to purge material that conflates terrorism with mainstream Islam, according to inside information cited in the Judicial Watch — arguably one of the most sympathetic lawmakers to Islamic causes — the event came in “response to the spike in anti-Muslim bigotry” and marked the first ever congressional hearing on Muslim civil rights.\nIt was Durbin who on the floor of the Senate in 2004 called U.S. soldiers Nazis, and detention centers such as Guantanamo Bay “gulags.” He later apologized, but his constituents were happy to hear him denigrating U.S. troops since his district has a very large Muslim population, according to news reports.\nAccording to the Examiner, other Muslim outreach efforts under Obama included; Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano meeting to discuss national security matters with a group of extremist Muslim organizations including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the nation’s space agency (NASA) being ordered to focus on Muslim diplomacy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing a special order to allow the reentry of two radical Islamic academics whose terrorist ties long banned them from the U.S.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What was the goal of the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training under President Barack Obama's administration?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The goal was to banish any material that could be viewed as offensive to Muslims.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Images\nVideos\nFrom Our Blog\nWhat Bertie Did Next\n13 June 2012\nCheck it out.

It is usual for these gems to be light in colour, even though some are known to exhibit rich tones. It is a variety of the mineral beryl that also includes emerald and aquamarine.\nMorganite was discovered in the early 1900’s in California and thereafter in Madagascar. Known initially as pink beryl, the crystal was renamed morganite in recognition of the financier and gem collector J.P. Morgan. The gem is also known as ‘pink emerald’ and ‘rose beryl’.\nThese stones are comparatively free of inclusions. The availability of huge Morganite rough allows for the possibility of large faceted crystals. The Brazilian stones can weigh more than ten kilograms.\nMetaphysical Meaning\nMorganite crystals have been linked to the heart\nAs a result of its subtle tone of pink, morganite crystals have been linked to the heart. For this reason, morganite rings serve excellently as engagement rings. It has been referred to as the Crystal of Eternal Love.\nThe vibrationsof morganite subtly heals the heart and opens it to unconditional love, repressed feelings and emotional needs that have not been fulfilled.\nMorganite’s energy is also linked to the love of the Heavenly, teaching us that we are all linked to a Universal Heart and form part of a broader design.\nMorganite is a symbol of beauty\nMorganite crystals are great symbols of beauty. They help one to see the beautiful things in life, the energies of which one could absorb into oneself. The love energy of morganite is said to make its wearer more beautiful both mentally and physically.\nThe gem with exceptional powers\nGemstones of the beryl group have exceptional powers, which means that the properties of Morganite are superior. These crystals are known to aid further in other aspects of spiritual advancement.\nAllow the Crystal of Eternal Love to work its magic for you\nThe vibration of love provoked by Morganite is extremely powerful. As long as the crystal is within your aura, it has an opportunity to work its magic.\nSo, treat yourself from the remarkable collection of morganite designs from Eldorado Diamonds. Designs that have been specifically selected to deliver to its wearer strong heart-centred energy.\nAllow the Crystal of Eternal Love to work its magic for you!&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some of the names Morganite is also known as?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Morganite is also known as 'pink emerald' and 'rose beryl'.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;construction of concrete crushing recycling in verona\nConstruction Waste Recycling concrete-crusher.org\nConstruction Waste Recycling Technology equipments to process construction waste into reutilized concrete Construction Waste Recycling; Concrete Crusher;\nCrushed Concrete Aggregate Concrete Construction\nCrushing old concrete to make aggregate for new concrete is increasing in popularity for executive director of the Construction Materials Recycling\nconstruction of concrete crushing recycling in la rioja 2\nConstruction of concrete crushing recycling in La Rioja.

Our student organizations are quite diverse and give aspiring journalists the opportunity to learn, create and socialize with fellow students who share their interests. They gain knowledge about their future profession through hosting guest speakers, social events and hands-on experience.\nThe officers of these organizations do all of the footwork for bringing in guest speakers; these events are open to the public and university. The organizations host social events that foster communication with other students who share their specific interests. Meeting times listed below are subject to change. Please check the Web site listed or contact the advisor for any changes in meeting times or information about upcoming events.\nSociety of Professional Journalists, Austin Chapter\nThe Society of Professional Journalists works to improve and protect journalism. The organization is the nation's largest.\nJoining the SPJ Austin Student Chapter gives students opportunities to deepen their journalistic knowledge outside of the classroom, connect with professionals in the industry, and attend various events. The SPJ Austin Student Chapter is a Registered Student Organization at the University of Texas at Austin.

The staff works on all sides of a magazine from advertising to editorial, production to writing, and finances to public relations. After working on ORANGE, the staff leaves with a strong portfolio and enough experience to tackle any one of New York's leading titles.\nThe Magazine Club (MAG)\nThe MAG Club in the School of Journalism is designed for those interested in a career in magazines. The club is a great place to begin, a low-pressure way to get your feet wet --- much more social than work!\nScheduled meetings are held each semester, usually once every three weeks with local professionals to discuss their experience in the field, bring in local magazine editors, often our own graduates to discuss magazine careers, and keep a running list of the latest internships and possible jobs.\nMAG is one of the few UT Sponsored Organizations on campus, so it is much more than just a \&quot;club.\&quot; We also have a working relationship with ED on Campus, the national college magazine club, founded by NYC magazine editors. We will show you how to tie into their national job bank and intern listings.\nMAG can also help you, at an early stage here, gain valuable hands-on experience with ORANGE, the campus magazine produced by School of Journalism students. But most importantly, we are just a group of people all working together to achieve success in the magazine industry!\nMAG also looks great on the resume. Check the display box for MAG (and ORANGE) on the 6th floor of the College of Communication Building) for more details.\nNational Press Photographer's Association\nThe National Press Photographers Association was founded in 1946.

UTHJ organizes fundraising activities to send members to the National Association of Hispanic Journalist convention during the summer, a weeklong opportunity of journalistic workshops and networking with the field's most influential journalists.\nFor more information, visit UTHJ's website:\nSend us an email at: uthispanicjournalists@gmail.com\nAdvisor: Dean Darrell Rocha&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some of the benefits of joining the SPJ Austin Student Chapter?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Joining the SPJ Austin Student Chapter gives students opportunities to deepen their journalistic knowledge outside of the classroom, connect with professionals in the industry, and attend various events.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In the light of all the discussion about disciplining your child that the NFL has created, I think this is a good time to talk about how to discipline teenagers, since it is very different from how you would discipline a young child.\nWhen disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.\nThe problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.\nOn the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”\nWhat to Do\n- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.\n- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.\n- Don’t be scared to set limits.\n- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.\n- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.\n- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.\n- Be a role model for your teenager.\n- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.\n- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.\n- Never use physical or mental torture.\n- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.\n- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!\nIn the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Some guidelines for disciplining a teenager include making expectations and rules clear, setting limits, not making rules arbitrarily, understanding that teenagers will mature through trial and error, rewarding constructive behavior, being a role model, being compassionate and patient during discussions, withdrawing privileges as a form of punishment without over-punishing, never using physical or mental torture, not giving in to tantrums or loud behavior, and not allowing guilt to cloud judgment. It's also important to remember that teenagers test the limits and to be compassionate and empathetic, remembering what it was like to be a teenager.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Virginia Environmental Education Certification program will officially launch January 3, 2022!\nDesigned with both formal and nonformal educators in mind, the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth. This certification program is relevant for anyone who educates about an aspect of the environment, would like to strengthen their environmental or pedagogical expertise, and is passionate about professionalism in environmental education.\nIt has been developed with the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) accreditation program in mind. That means you can trust in the quality of materials and the learning process of the program, and once accredited, your certification will be transferable to any state with an NAAEE accredited program.\n_____________________________________________________\nFrom NAAEE: \&quot;Professional certification ensures that individuals are fully prepared for work within a specific field of expertise. Certified environmental educators meet stringent requirements for proficiency in both the interdisciplinary content and pedagogy necessary to develop and deliver high quality, effective EE programs.\nWhile it is not necessary to attain certification in order to be employed as an environmental educator, certification readily distinguishes highly qualified professionals and enhances the resumes of those who have attained it. Having a community of certified professionals also elevates respect for the profession.\&quot;\nHow to Get Started\nHow Much Does It Cost?\nBenefits of Certification\nYou can begin planning your approach to\nthe certification program now.\nEnrollment officially opens January 3, 2022. At that time, interested candidates can apply online to gain access to the online learning platform that houses all of the certification information, instructions, assignments, and opportunities to submit your work.\nPlease check out our certification timeline below to learn about the program's schedule including: fees, workshops, trainings, online modules, and more.\nCandidates have three years after paying the application fee to complete the certification process.\nPortfolio submission fee (end of certification): $50\n__________________________________________\nTOTAL required fees: $325\nOther expenses will likely be incurred over the course of the multi-year certification process in order to meet self-guided learning requirements including training/workshop/conference fees, travel, and lodging. Each candidate will determine how they will meet their own self-guided learning goals. Take a look at the Virginia Environmental Education Certification Manual (coming soon) to learn more.\nGood for the field of Environmental Education:\nCertification\naddresses the knowledge, skills, and ethical standards required to work\nas a professional in the EE field and builds the field’s credibility.\nGood for you, the environmental educator:\nCertification provides robust professional development opportunities resulting in more effective professional practice. Its focus on both theory and practice leads towards greater mastery. Due to this program’s multi-faceted nature, networking opportunities abound.\nOnce you’ve obtained your certificate, you can be contracted and paid by the VAEE to facilitate training workshops wherever you’re already located.\nVAEE is working with environmental education organizations to incentivize and promote environmental education certificate holders.\nEE Certification Completion Timeline\nOverview of Certification Requirements\nCriteria 1 – The Basics of Environmental Education (online learning module)\nCriteria 2: In-Person Learning (three total workshop days)\n2.1 Attend “Professional Development of Environmental Educators” Workshop – one day\n2.2 Attend “Methods of Environmental Education” Workshop – two days\nCriteria 3: Self-Directed Learning (75 hours)\n3.1 Individually Chosen Learning Opportunities (minimum 30 hours)\n3.2 Exploration of Virginia’s Regions (minimum 30 hours)\n3.3 Required Further Learning (minimum 15 hours)\nCriteria 4: Lesson Planning and Teaching (30+ hours)\nCriteria 5: Environmental Literacy online module\nCriteria 6: Capstone Project (20+ hours)\nFAQs\nI want to start the program, but I have already completed the previously released Criteria 1. Do I have to do it again?\nCriteria 1 has seen minimal changes, and you can submit the work that you have already completed as soon as you have access to Canvas. Please note that some new assignments may have been added to Criteria 1, and they will be most useful, so be sure to look for those and complete those as well.\nI enrolled in the certification program in 2019. What can I expect?\nCandidates who paid to enroll in the certification program in 2019 are permitted to submit Criteria 1, 3, and 4 work that was completed as early as one year prior to their original enrollment date. This is an exception for the 2019 cohort. Also, candidates who completed the “Professional Development of Environmental Educators” workshop will be able to check that off of their accomplishments. Likewise, if those same candidates also subsequently took the “Methods of Environmental Education” workshop, you have also received credit for that part of Criteria 2.

Candidates who paid their initial application fee in 2019 will not be required to pay another application fee.\nAcknowledgements:\nThe VAEE would like to extend its heart-felt thanks to the volunteers who serve on the Certification Advisory Board (CAB) for their dedication to carrying the dream of a Virginia EE Certification program forward. Certification program development was begun by the Virginia Office of Environmental Education, but when it was closed in 2016, the VAEE chose to continue this work. A couple of intrepid volunteers kept the process going, and soon the CAB was formed and started on the path to making Virginia EE Certification a reality.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the purpose of the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth.

These sites continue to be meaningful to Native peoples and are considered sacred to those whose tribes were forced from Ohio long ago. These monumental works of archaeoastronomy and landscape architecture bear remarkable testimony to the multifaceted genius of aboriginal North Americans in the Ohio Valley and to an artistic and cultural flowering that had significant impacts all across the continent between 900 and 2,600 years ago. Inscription on the World Heritage List would underscore the cultural significance of these sites and call international attention to these treasures long known to Ohioans.\nThe Nomination Process\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service control and guide the process that culminates in a nomination of these sites to UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization – which administers the World Heritage List.\nCurrently the – Fort Ancient in Warren County, the Newark Earthworks in Licking County, and the earthworks included in the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.\nThe Need for Support\nA working group of archaeologists, anthropologists, architects, cultural landscape historians, museum and park administrators, and Native Americans are collaborating to complete a draft of this document for review by the National Park Service before a final submission can be made to UNESCO. Funding is needed to continue the progress toward the completion of the draft nomination: consulting with other World Heritage sites and nominee organizations and other experts; performing additional research; compiling all required data; formulating required management plans; developing economic impact studies, and designing the draft document. The experience of other successful U.S. and international applicants for inscription indicates that preparation of the nomination requires at least one full time staff person and – in addition to the contributions of the working group - the services of various consultants, researchers, photographers, graphic designers, and editors. Therefore, we estimate that an investment of between $800,000 and $1,200,000 may be necessary to document the significance of our sites and how they will be managed, in a comprehensive and appropriate manner designed to elicit favorable consideration by UNESCO.\nHow to Get Involved\nIf you would like to support this wonderful opportunity to put Ohio’s ancient earthworks on the worldwide map of historically and culturally significant sites, click here.

I have two chassis with PXIe 8880 controllers and with PXI-8512 interface modules.\nI need to exchange data between those two PXI 8880 controllers and the question is if I can use PXI-8512 modules to send and receive data with CAN protocol? The data is from third part custom device (vehicle simulator). If it is not possible, how can I exchange data between two controllers?\nThank you for answer.\n05-10-2017 05:34 AM\nHello krzesniak1,\nthe direct answer to your question is yes, you can use CAN to share data between your controllers.\nIn my opinion it is not the best way though. If the controllers are networked, you can use shared variables (network-published) as explained in this white paper:\nTHis will give you a smoother programming experience and more flexibility than CAN. Obviously, it may be better to use CAN if you want this data to be a part of a bigger system that uses this communication protocol.\nAs an unrelated tip, it is best to think of PXI controllers as computers, so you can use any way of communication you would normally use between two computers (TCP, ftp, UDP etc.)\nBest Regards,\nNick\nAE@NIUK\n05-15-2017 06:20 AM\nThank you for your advice. However I also use VeriStand to deploy a project and I am not sure how to use a shared variables with VeriStand.

For this all-new album, he sings selections both familiar and less well-known as well as duets with soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. Highlghts include selections from I Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Roberto Devereux and many more.\nA cynic might look at Roberto Alagna’s new disc, ‘My Life is an Opera’, and think, ‘At least he admits it’. From his stormy La Scala stage departure to his relationship with Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna’s personal life is…well, operatic. Somewhat embarrassingly, the disc’s booklet has each of the arias listed (out of order from their disc sequencing) to illustrate some signpost in his life, though instead of dealing with the aforementioned incidents in this loose autobiography, the text speaks of the ‘meteoric’ rise of this ‘golden-voiced handsome young genius’. (Oh dear.)\nBut anyone who thought the medium-weight Alagna voice was on the way out with his Radamès and Otello might be dumbfounded at his excellent state of vocal health on the disc, and the sure dramatic instincts behind it. Most of the repertoire seems new to Alagna’s discography, though there are very few signs of having just learnt arias from Gluck’s Orfeo, The Queen of Sheba (both the Gounod and Goldmark versions) and Reyer’s Sigurd.\nAside from forays into Puccini’s Manon Lescaut and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci, the programme seems to signify a re-commitment to his fundamentally mid-weight lyric vocal personality, not playing safe in the way he builds phrases and longer-term musical climaxes but rarely pushing his limits (the closest he comes is in an excerpt from his brother David Alagna’s opera Le dernier jour d’un condamné ). Lensky’s aria from Eugene Onegin is in French translation, not Russian. Bel canto choices such as the dramatically charged duet from Roberto Devereux (with Aleksandra Kurzak) don’t require serious coloratura.\nThe biggest vocal surprise is ‘Magische Töne’ from the Goldmark Sheba, in which Alagna goes into the falsetto stratosphere with a musico-dramatic effect that stands well alongside performances by the great tenors of the past, including Nicolai Gedda and Leo Slezak. Alagna doesn’t have a particularly strong-minded collaborator in the London Orchestra (an ensemble I’ve never heard of) and its Director Yvan Cassar. But recorded sound is first-class. –David Patrick Stearns, Gramophone\nTracklist:\nGiacomo Puccini (1858-1924)\n1. Manon Lescaut / Act 2: Ah ! Manon, mi tradisce 2:52\n2.

Doing this while navigating Coronavirus is especially challenging. Many have been asked to plan for a semester that accommodates hybrid learning or the flexibility of transitioning from in-person to digital learning at a moment’s notice.\nThis coming Fall, a teacher’s responsibilities will extend far beyond restructuring their curricula. We know that teachers have an important impact on a child’s mental/physical health, social well being, and more. With everything that our students have been dealing with since March, this impact is more important than ever. Balancing all of these responsibilities, with new school guidelines, in addition to protecting their own health is a lot for one person to handle.\nWe at CSD Learns want to ease that burden.\nCSD Learns STEM Toolkits Are the Adaptable Resources You Need\nWe have worked with subject matter experts to create a series of STEM Teacher’s Toolkits to use in elementary, middle, and high school. These toolkits are easy to implement online, in-person – or both simultaneously.\nFeaturing deaf and hard of hearing role models, each toolkit provides educators with several weeks’ worth of lessons (in ASL) that students will love. Each free toolkit has videos, interactive activities, quizzes and more. Keep reading to find the perfect toolkit for your classroom.\nTeach Your Middle Schoolers to Stay Safe Online\nWith our students spending so much time online –even more now with virtual learning – it’s important they know how to stay safe.\nOur Developing Your Cybersense Toolkits, created in partnership with RIT/NTID, provide you with four weeks of lessons on cybersecurity. Your students will learn about topics like information security, digital footprints, social media use, and fake news from four deaf and hard of hearing role models.\nInspire your High Schoolers to Pursue a Career in STEM\nDid you know that deaf and hard of hearing workers who pursue STEM careers earn up to 30% more than deaf workers in non-STEM careers? In addition to that, STEM careers are projected to grow by nearly 9% over the next eight years. It’s the perfect time to be encouraging students to pursue and education in STEM.\nOur “Immersion in STEM” series highlights careers in four different areas of STEM; immunology, nanoengineering, programming, and statistics. Your high schoolers will learn about what it takes to have a successful career in STEM from four pros who’ve been there before!\nPique Your Elementary Students’ Interest in STEM\nIt’s never too early for your students to start learning about their immune system, how their computers work, why math is important, what goes into the technology they use every day – and more.\nOur “All About STEM” series covers important foundational concepts in immunology, programming, statistics, and engineering, all in a way that will excite and engage your younger students.\nFlexible, Free STEM Courses for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students\nWith so many uncertainties in the year coming up ahead – let CSD Learns take away one of them.

He spends the majority of his life contemplating and acting out revenge towards Hindley and the Lintons because he believes it was their fault Catherine thought it would “degrade” her to marry Heathcliff, even though she loved him; this is one example of his unstable mind set. In chapter 9 Nelly foreshadows the suffering of Heathcliff by saying “if you [Catherine] are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature,” this is because Nelly understands that society wouldn’t accept the pair to marry, therefore Heathcliff will be unfortunately heartbroken. Heathcliff believes that Catherine is a part of him: “I cannot live without my soul,” he says which highlights that he is suffering without her. It is from this heartbreak and suffering that his “diseased mind” commenced. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” heightens when he asks for Catherine to “haunt” him when she is dead; haunting is an element of the Gothic genre but the madness of Heathcliff is enhanced when he requests that Catherine drives him “mad.”\nThe word “mad” is ambiguous in this quotation because it could be viewed that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is angry with Catherine so he can destroy his love for her. An alternative view is that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is insane and suffering since he is desperate to see Catherine, this becomes true because after Catherine’s death Heathcliff’s mind is haunted by his love for her. Jerold E. Hogle explains this is accurate because characters in Gothic novels are “haunted psychologically” and this is accurately shown through the character of Heathcliff. His mind is “diseased” by his separation from Catherine due to her choice of partner and her death, which causes him and everyone in the novel immense suffering because of his vengeance.\nHeathcliff’s unconditional love causes Catherine’s “melancholy” “mental state” because it is overwhelming and she is in love with him but a Victorian society wouldn’t accept their relationship because of the Heathcliff’s very low class, which would result in them being “beggars.” Catherine has “a peculiar expression arising from her mind set” before she tells Heathcliff “you have killed me,” this highlights her “diseased mind” and the suffering it is causing her because she hasn’t died yet but it could be interpreted that she feels as though she has which emphasises her suffering, but also her madness. The “peculiar expression” that Catherine is described to have could be because she was “thinking… of Wuthering Heights.”\nThe “expression” could be interpreted as a smile, which would be “peculiar” to Nelly because she has been depressed living with Edgar, therefore a smile would be unusual; David Punter explains “Gothic reminds us we are driven by our passions” and Catherine’s passion is Heathcliff, which would explain her “expression” when thinking about Wuthering Heights. This idea of Catherine’s thought process in her “diseased mind” emphasises her pain and suffering because she cannot be without Heathcliff, her “soul,” yet she is continuously thinking about him, this is essentially what drives her insane.\nCatherine’s mental suffering is closely linked with her physical suffering which is an example that represents the “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights. Another character with a “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights is Isabella, whose “bruised” body is a valid example of suffering. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” causes him to abuse Isabella which leads to her suffering and her injured body\nA\nSubject: Mind, Suffering,\nUniversity/College: University of Arkansas System\nType of paper: Thesis/Dissertation Chapter\nDate: 17 August 2016\nWords:\nPages:\nWe will write a custom essay sample on Diseased Body in Wuthering Heights\nfor only $16.38 $13.9/page\nyour testimonials\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Who are the characters in Wuthering Heights that display a \&quot;diseased mind\&quot; and a \&quot;diseased body\&quot;?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The characters in Wuthering Heights that display a \&quot;diseased mind\&quot; are Heathcliff and Catherine.

He received a BS degree in pharmacy from the University of Wisconsin and a MS and PhD in pharmaceutical administration from the Ohio State University. He has practice experience in both independent and chain community pharmacy settings. He teaches courses in pharmacy management, business planning for professional services, and drug literature evaluation. His research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists. ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completing this chapter, readers should be able to Define the terms management and manager. Describe how concepts in management figure into our everyday lives. Compare and contrast management and leadership. Compare and contrast classical views of management with modern views. Describe the management process within the contexts of what managers do, resources they manage, and levels at which managers perform their roles. Integrate modern views of management with the management process. Apply the management process to all personal and professional activities. ++ SCENARIO ++ Krista Connelly is a second-year pharmacy student. Like most second-year students, she describes her life as “incredibly stressed out.” A typical day consists of getting up at 6 am, getting dressed and running out the door by 7 am, and driving to school to get to her first class by 8 am (making sure to avoid the accident on the expressway that she heard about on her way out the door). While at school, she finds time to squeeze in cups of coffee and snack bars between the lectures, labs, and workshops that usually last until at least 4 pm. She also makes a point to go to the library to prepare upcoming assignments, as well as to meet with her professors to review how she did on her examinations. ++ After class today, Krista has an Academy of Students of Pharmacy (ASP) meeting. Krista is the president of her chapter and works with committee chairs to accomplish the goals of the organization. In the past few weeks, she has helped the new professional service chairperson develop a diabetes screening program, talked her fundraising chairperson out of quitting, and wrote a report on each committee’s activities for the chapter website. While Krista enjoys her leadership role in ASP, she finds some of the people she works with to be frustrating and wonders how she can motivate them to do a better job. ++ After her meeting, Krista drives to a fast-food restaurant to grab a quick dinner on her way to her part-time pharmacy intern job. If she is not working, she will head to a friend’s house to study for an upcoming examination. She usually gets back to her apartment by 10 pm and mentally prepares for what she needs to&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are Dr. Zgarrick's research interests?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Dr. Zgarrick's research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:36,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;.\nCompassion &amp; Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee made a comment during an end-of-life (EOL) panel discussion that resonated fully: to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”\nThink about this. Redefine the standard of care at end of life.\nThis compact statement is everything required to support us all in achieving the peaceful demise virtually all of us say we want, yet barely an inverse number achieve. It’s so simple, and so profound.\nBarbara’s phrase takes the act of redefining language—my launching point when conceiving and discussing how to advocate when hospitalized, and how to achieve a peaceful demise—to a fully dimensional place. Because language, no matter it’s power, is less dimensional than action. Language, as powerful as it is in framing our expectations and thoughts, merely informs action. Action in medicine equals treatment. Treatment is fully dimensional. We act on language; we experience treatment. We die, and survivors live, with the results of treatment choices we make, or fail to make.\nThe advent of life support technologies in the 1960s and development of a home for them (the intensive care unit, or ICU) has its clinically logical extension in the chronic ICU facility, with floors of beds for dozens or hundreds of comatose bodies maintained on life support).\nApplying this technology endlessly, some would say mindlessly, at the end of life has evolved into the standard of care. But by whose definition?\nThe irony of American culture is that we seem to pay homage to the notion of individuality yet in many matters, especially how we exit this planet, we traipse along like lemmings. Medicine has defined the EOL standard of care. By and large citizens have acquiesced to medicine’s definition, even with survivors from family after family recoiling from their experiences.\nMy mantra bears repeating: we actually have to do something in order to increase the likelihood of dying in peace. I begin to articulate what it is we must do here and here.\nPart of my language assessment is that our experience of treatment does not feel like or equate to care. Yet providers believe that the treatment they offer equals care. Now, we’ll never strip the letters ‘care’ from the healthcare conversation, for evident reason. But we can examine and clarify obfuscating language so as not to lose the first week of a terminal (or any) hospitalization to bewilderment over what is not happening and what is happening.\nWhat constitutes the standard of care has been invisible, like the air in a flotation device. The device is nothing without the air, yet we never think or speak in terms of that air, only the floaty. But redefining the standard of care is something we can act on and influence. Because that’s about agreement, and consent or refusal to consent. That’s our personal, social, and legal right. The right to informed consent at end of life is being slowly codified into law. But that’s all about the provider side. What about the citizen side?\nTHE missing voice from panel after panel about EOL matters is ours: citizens’. By “citizens” I mean informed citizens; patient-family members who’ve been through the forest and have mapped it. Articulate people who’ve transformed from harmed persons into patient advocates or activists. We have insightful comments to add because we have deeply parsed the kinds of experiences you really do not want your patient-family to have.\nWe’re out here. Some, like me, have been recognized by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a well-respected non-profit responsible for significant advances inpatient safety. Redefining the standard of care requires more than panels of medical and policy experts with no informed citizen representation.\nPatient advocates bring a different voice to the conversation. I suspect our voice is regarded as scary by panel hosts (if not many panelists) because it necessarily comes from gut level. This implies real feeling, but does not imply craziness. Ours is the voice of passionate clarification, not the dispassionate voice of the clinic or the legislature.\nThe simple truth is this: including the informed citizens’ voice in every panel discussion is the first step towards redefining the end-of-life standard of care.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What did Barbara Coombs Lee suggest to help more people die in peace?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Barbara Coombs Lee suggested that to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A Chili's parking lot in Florida marked the beginning of a tragedy Sunday evening when a local man attacked his wife, then picked up his two young children from the babysitter's and shot them before turning the gun on himself, Seminole County deputies reported.\nThe sequence of events began when the suspect, 30-year-old Henry Brown, hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant. Records indicate that their marriage had been rocky ever since his wife, 31-year-old Chericia Brown, had an injunction issued in January following a domestic battery report from the month before.\nUpon leaving the restaurant around 10 p.m., Chericia was rushed by Henry, who had been lying in wait, and stabbed multiple times. The attack prompted a nurse and paramedic, who were dining at the establishment, to come and help, but that's when Henry returned to the scene in a bid to finish the job by running her over - and hitting the two good Samaritans in the process.\nAfterward, Henry drove to Alamonte Springs and changed vehicles to a Ford F250. While there, he also picked up his two children - a 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son - from the babysitter.\nWith the two in tow, he headed to Central Florida Regional Hospital in search of his wife, but security and witnesses recognized him, prompting him to pull out his gun and open fire on law enforcement and security personnel in an attempt to flee. Deputies said they returned fire, but were unable to prevent him from fleeing to Interstate 4.\nHe drove westbound along the interstate, eventually being discovered by police near the Seminole-Volusia county line just minutes later. Deputies successfully used stop sticks to slow Henry's vehicle down, but upon closing in to arrest him, they found him as well as his two children dead inside.\nInvestigators said they believe Brown killed his children at some point after picking them up, then committed suicide while police prepared to apprehend him.\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, at some point during the night, Chericia died at the hospital from her injuries.\nI-4 near the St. Johns River Bridge was shut down for hours after the incident, but has since reopened.\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting at the hospital.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What sequence of events led to the tragedy in a Chili's parking lot in Florida?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The sequence of events began when Henry Brown hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant.

But before the city is able to cut its dependence on federal government funds, it is receiving lavish sums to help it pay for the overhaul of East Berlin’s rotting infrastructure and the merging of its eastern and western halves into one modern city.\nOf its total 1992 budget of 41.88 billion Deutsche marks (about $25 billion), Berlin will receive 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, raise 13 percent through new borrowing and generate 26 percent through taxes.\nFinance Senator Elmar Pieroth said the debt level, one that would be considered irresponsible under normal circumstances, was unavoidable given the magnitude of the job to be done.\n“We have no other choice,” he said in an interview. “We can’t build the Wall back and make the East stay at the level it is today.”\nEast Berlin’s needs range from sewer equipment to telecommunications systems and include just about everything in between. Both East and West Berlin need housing, efficient power generating and distribution equipment, and better road connections to each other and the rest of Germany.\nWhile it is clear that many improvements have already been made – public transportation runs efficiently between East and West and the phone lines across town are no longer as impossibly busy as they once were – there remains more work to be done than originally estimated. The Berlin and German governments have already begun negotiations to extend payments from the special German Unity Fund beyond the planned cutoff date of 1995. Also being discussed is the timetable for the federal government’s move to Berlin. While Berlin is lobbying for it to take place as soon as possible, the federal government seems to want to postpone both the move and the accompanying bills until the late nineties.\nEarlier this year, Bonn even floated a trial balloon, suggesting some ministries should remain where they are.\n“The move is more difficult than expected,” said Siemens AG Vice President Joachim Putzmann, chief of the electrical and electronics company’s Berlin administration. While he is optimistic about Berlin’s future, Mr. Putzmann said there are still very few decision-makers in the city and German business needs to see the government back in Berlin before it relocates key people and operations.\nThe pace of Berlin’s expansion will be partially reflected in the growth of the city’s taxes, which are targeted to triple to 18.5 billion marks in 1995 from 6.09 billion marks in 1990. Mr. Pieroth said 4 billion marks of the increase will come from new economic activity in East Berlin, 3 billion marks from general economic growth and 3 billion marks from the phasing out of the tax breaks granted to West Berlin business before unification, when the West German government compensated companies for the disadvantage of their geographic and economic location in the middle of East Germany.\nThe loss of the tax breaks is proving to have a variety of effects, often depending on the type of business involved. Retailers, who have been flooded with new customers from Eastern Germany, and producers of consumer goods and foodstuffs, who have found it relatively easy to boost their sales in the newly accessible surrounding markets, will tend not to suffer.\nBut other companies, such as the pharmaceutical and chemical giant Schering AG, say profits are being hit despite an aggressive sales and marketing push into Central and Eastern Europe. “The structure of the economy in these countries and the lack of hard currency has complicated our plan to increase sales,” said Horst Kramp, a member of Schering’s executive board. “In the short term, we can’t compensate for our higher costs through increased sales so we must save wherever we can.”\nAlthough Schering, the only major German company that currently has its headquarters in Berlin, does not plan to cut either jobs or investment, its rationalization program and comparable cost-cutting at other firms has had a ripple effect on the Berlin economy.\nThe owner of a small language school who expected business to improve thanks to increased demand from East Berliners keen to learn English has seen any such benefit canceled out as regular corporate customers have cut back on extras.\nSmall business has also been squeezed by the skyrocketing rates for office rental and the sharply higher costs of land.\nALTHOUGH there have been numerous calls for the government to control the rise of property and rental costs both for business and housing, Mr. Pieroth said Berliners must adapt to the prices, which are no higher than in other West German cities.\nDespite the greater influence of market forces in both East and West Berlin’s economic life, neither business leaders or politicians envisage a day when the city will be able to do entirely without government support. Berlin will always need a certain amount of help to pay for its many expensive cultural and educational institutions. As a consequence of its history as a divided city, Berlin has separate museum systems, universities, national theater companies and opera houses. While some of the museum collections can be merged and a few of the smaller theaters privatized, Berlin believes that in its role as Germany’s capital, it is crucial to keep the rest.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are the main sources of Berlin's total 1992 budget?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Berlin's total 1992 budget comes from 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, 13 percent through new borrowing, and 26 percent through taxes.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;617-291-8171 | info@vancekoven.com | LinkedIn\nThursday, April 16, 2020\nOne conc ...read more\nMonday, February 04, 2019\nIs it 2019 yet?

Make Sure Customer Service Reps Understand What They’re Talking About\nIt’s vital that the call center staff have more than a passing familiarity with the products or services a client offers. This helps call center representatives to answer questions about those items more accurately and thoroughly when they come up. Having this background knowledge and access to FAQs will make it easier for them to emphasize with concerned customers and find rapport when they call. Plus, it gives the agent the ability to solve the problem on their own.. Understanding more about your business helps improve the overall experience for the customer and the agent.\n2. Create Templatized Responses for Popular Questions\nSome call centers offer scripts of basic phrases or responses but this approach can sometimes be limiting and may even have a negative outcome. It’s certainly easy to follow along until something changes, such as a customer asking or saying something unexpected. Rather than confusing the agent or forcing them to pause and regroup, a template of common topics and responses might be more useful. Instead of forcing the representative not to veer from what is stated on the particular script, they can instead learn the frequently asked questions and common solutions. This also allows them to show more creativity and initiative in adapting the conversation as needed.\n3. Consider an Automated Answering Service\nA goal of most call centers – and most callers – is to connect with a human when possible, since most problems need further explanation and context to try and solve. You can streamline your customer service, improve your efficiency and ensure your customers get connected with the right person by utilizing an automated answering service. An automated answering service can help callers reach the right point of contact by creating a phone tree for your company. That way, when they do connect to a live agent, they are speaking with the appropriate person, and they can jump right into finding a solution. This helps overall efficiency in terms of less time spent with each caller. It also makes sure customers are sent to the right group instead of being transferred time and time again until being connected to the right department. This strategy streamlines your customer service efforts by helping the agent be more prepared to interact with a customer. An automated answering service can also provide more than just a phone tree solution; they can send out appointment reminders, announcements, and surveys too.\nInterestingly, an automated answering service combined with a live answering service can dramatically improve your customer service efficiency.\n4. Try a Virtual Answering Service\nA virtual answering service puts the “human” interaction right at the front line/initial point of contact. This type of service can be used for busy places that have a high call volume and need help answering callers’ questions, or for a company that wants every caller to be initially greeted by a friendly voice and then transferred to the appropriate contact. Using a virtual answering service can also make sense financially. Rather than hiring several receptionists or other administrative staff to handle all the calls, a customer call center can handle the load. Every employee on this team will be trained in proper greetings and common questions, and it will be so seamless that callers won’t be able to tell that the person greeting them and directing their call isn’t actually in the same building, or even the same state. This option can save your organization a good deal of time and money.\nThe previous four solutions barely scratch the service of ways that a customer call center such as AnswerNow can aid your business. Utilizing the service of a regularly trained team which specializes in customer service and helping to take care of customer concerns as efficiently as possible is definitely a win-win for your organization.\nWhat makes an AnswerNow team special? In addition to high standards of quality, our organization also focuses on other attributes, such as making sure to fulfill any promises given or made, and getting back to someone with answers as quickly as possible.\nInterested in learning how you can enhance your company’s customer service efficiency, then come explore our free e-book: 10 Commandments of Customer Service.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a call center staff?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Some strategies include ensuring customer service representatives understand the products or services they are discussing, creating templatized responses for popular questions, considering an automated answering service, and trying a virtual answering service.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:41,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Just a heads up to let you know on November 2nd, I will be doing a cover reveal for my novel The Newstead Project, as well as the book trailer, and swag give away.

I know that as the author, I have the vision about how I want things to look, be, presented, but still; scary.\nOh in case I didn’t mention it the swag is bookmarks (of course) and black cinch sacs with the Plan Well.

But when the time comes to let go, it can also be wrenching.\nOnce you’ve become attached to a sweet dog, it can bedifficult bordering onimpossible to say goodbye. Many people, recognizing their limitations, have told me flat-out that they couldn’t possibly foster because they quickly form a bond and cannot let go.\nThis is why so manyanimal rescuersbecome “foster failures” – i.e. they wind up adopting a dog they initially planned to house on a temporary basis. How do you say farewell to a creature you’ve fed and played with, medicated and cuddled? As one rescuer I know memorably said, “Failure never felt so good.”\nBut that doesn’t mean foster success feels less good.It feels great – and it frees up room in your home and heart for the next needy K9. But before you can experience the joy of foster success, first you -the foster caregiver – mustfacesome serious separation anxiety.And that ain’t easy.\nAs foster caregivers, we strive to do what’s in the best interest of the dog in question. And in the case of my beloved Lady Bug,the right thing to do was let go. So that’s what I did yesterday: Ientrusted herto an excellentrescue group that already has a beautiful permanent home lined up and waiting for the perfect Chihuahua.\nWhich is precisely what Bug is. I’ll never forget how calm she remained when the ceiling in my apartment fell in. Or how perfectly housetrained she is. Or her adorablehabit of jumping into my lap.\nI’m a big-dog person, and I’m a sucker for aK9 in need. That explains how I came to have 6 large dogs,each of them clamoring for my attention 24/7. My mother never fails to let me know that each one of my dogs wants to the the only dog. She always delivers this line with a disapprovingshake of her head, as if I’m subjecting the members of my pack to the worst kind of emotional torture imaginable.\nPerhapsshe is right – unfortunately, like most Moms, she’s almost always right.\nIn my defense, I’ll say what I always tell my Mom: That mybig dogs enjoy each other’s company enormously. But Bug is a different story. Let’s just say she’s not a dog person; she’s a people person. She loves getting attention from members of the human species, and returns that attention a hundredfold. She fits my mother’s profile of a dog who wants to be an only child.Bug wanted me all to herself. And sadly, what with my prior commitment to my family of big dogs, this is not something Iwas able togive her.\nI can, however, do my utmost to see to it that Bug gets exactly what she wants out of life:A wonderful, caring home in which she and her amazing, gravity-defyingears arethe radiant center of attention.\nAs we waited on my stoop for the car to come and pick her up, Bug nestled sweetly in my lap. I buried my face in her neck; she gave me passionate French-Mexican kisses, slipping her tongue into my mouth. It was always difficult to photograph her because she’s a constantly moving target, wiggling at high speeds andmoving her head from side to side to take in every detail of her surroundings.\nThis time, however, I was able to get some amazingly pensive shots of my little girl – that’s how relaxed she was. The most casual observer would’ve had a hard time not noticing how very attached to each other we’d become, my Love Bug and I.\nThenher rideappeared.\nI handedBug over to the driver, then ran inside to get her paperwork, postponing the inevitable for just a few minutes more. As I came back down the steps of my building, I nearly called the whole thing off when I sawBug sittingin the driver’s lap with her ears perked up, watching and waiting for me with laserlike focus.Her worried expressionnearly broke my heart! She clearly expected me tojoin herin the vehicle. But I maintained my resolve, handed over the papers, kissed her twomore times- then turned around andwent back inside.\nI’ll give you the Bug update as soon as I have it. It’s hard to believe a creature weighing just 9 pounds could leave my heart so heavy by her absence. That littledog will be missed in no small way.\nOur Most-Commented Stories\nJulia Szabo | May 2nd 2011&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is a \&quot;foster failure\&quot; in the context of animal rescue?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A \&quot;foster failure\&quot; in the context of animal rescue refers to when animal rescuers end up adopting a dog they initially planned to house on a temporary basis.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mail.\nMPs are to receive taxpayer-funded iPads in an attempt to modernise Parliament.One of the things most people in industry notice is that any cost saving or paper saving equipment usually costs a lot and generates more paperwork. There's also the problem that iPads are not exactly suitable office style equipment, the big advantage of a laptop is the keyboard, the onscreen keyboard the iPad uses is nowhere near as fast or as useful, so as a research tool it's less than satisfactory. Battery life is limited, doesn't support flash (no kidding) and can’t make phone calls, can’t take pictures, and the most affordable model only has WiFi.\nPoliticians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return.\nAround 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade.\nBuying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move.\nBut the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper.\nThere’s also no multitasking in the iPad because it uses some variant of the iPhone OS. This means you can’t listen to Spotify and browse the web at the same time. No working in Pages while making a VoIP call. And the list goes on…\nAnd because of the closed nature of all things Apple, there’s no simple way to transfer files to and from the iPad. Why is this relevant? Well, it means all the media files will have to be synced through iTunes, which always involves conversions to the mad Apple formats. There’s no way to just drag and drop them over WiFi or using a USB Mass Storage Device.\nNot to mention all the documents produced with iWork (which even deserved to be ported to the iPad). Where will those go? And while we’re in this department, how can a device coined as a “great productivity tool” lack the support for non-Apple office software (Microsoft and Openoffice).\nThe main problem though is that the most affordable model is very, very expensive compared to say a netbook and the money for it is coming out of our pockets, not the House of Commons or the MP's.\nEssentially it's a massive waste of money to give MP's a \&quot;cool\&quot; iPad on the taxpayers expense, it wont improve productivity and it wont save paper as MP's wont be able to use it for the purposes it's supposedly to be used for.\nThey'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop.\n1 annotations:\n\&quot;They'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop\&quot; ...\nThey don't even need those, all MP's have advisers, researchers, interns etc crawling out their arseholes .. they all have mobile phones, which are no doubt being paid for by us .. they should be using those for back-channel info &amp; comms ..\nThe country is in shit-order, small businesses are going to the wall, law &amp; order is getting out of hand, immigration has already got out of hand &amp; these cretins are poncing around with iPads ..\nThis is nothing more nor less than self-indulgent people, indulging themselves yet again, at our expence, because they can ..\nIts been said before but will stand repetition ..\nThe lunatics really have taken over the asylum ..&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some of the criticisms mentioned about providing iPads to MPs in the House of Commons?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The criticisms include the high cost of iPads, their unsuitability as office equipment due to the lack of a physical keyboard, limited battery life, lack of support for flash, inability to make phone calls or take pictures, and the need to sync media files through iTunes. It is also mentioned that the most affordable model only has WiFi and that the iPads would not improve productivity or save paper as intended. The text also criticizes the decision as a waste of taxpayers' money.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:44,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Independent perfumer Thomas Kosmala has been creating fragrances at his stunning HQ in the south of France for a decade. While he’s originally from Poland and now lives in London, Thomas is fascinated with the Middle East and its love of scent. His latest range, the Signature Collection, which is inspired by our region, features four fragrances that use ingredients such as oud, rose, amber and violet. He tells Friday how he built a career in fragrance and his secrets to wearing scents.\nWhen did your love for fragrance begin?\nIt started when I was working in London with aromatherapy oils. I began to realise how important the smell of things are and it made me want to look further into it. This led me to begin my career in fragrance.\nWhere did your inspiration come for your Signature Collection?\nThe collection is inspired by the Middle East but the combination of ingredients was chosen to send the customer on a journey. Each ingredient is in its purest form so the scent will last longer.\nYour factory is based in France – do you source a lot of your ingredients there or does it depend on the brief?\nMy ingredients are of the best quality and are sourced from all over the world, however they are processed at my factory in France. It’s a magical process when we bring all these ingredients together in there.\nAre there any particular scents you think work well together?\nI would never say there are any ingredients that don’t work together. Never say never, and try everything. I do love to smell powdery and musky scents together.\nHow important is the way someone smells?\nIt is more important than people would ever realise. The way someone smells is often the first thing you’ll notice about them and the thing you will remember for the longest after you have met them.\nWhere is the best part of the body to apply fragrance?\nFirstly this depends on the person’s own taste, and secondly where they are or what they are doing that day. If you were at work or on a long flight, for example, and wanted something subtle you would apply scent to your wrists, but if you wanted something stronger you would apply fragrance to your chest and neck area.\nAre there different rules to wearing scent for men and women?\nThe rules are the same. All my fragrances are unisex and can smell very different on men and women as they adapt to the person.\nWhich celebrity would you like to create a scent for, and what would it be like?\nI would love to create a fragrance for female tennis stars. It would be fresh and something light that they could wear while playing. I have always been a huge tennis fan and play myself, so combining my two passions is something that really interests me.\nHow do you make a fragrance last all day?\nUse a fragrance that has only the purest ingredients. This might be expensive but I believe it is worth it. Cheaper fragrances often use diluted ingredients, meaning the smell wears off much quicker.\nCan you give us your dos and don’ts for wearing fragrance?\n- Don’t be afraid to experiment with scents you wouldn’t usually wear – you’ll be surprised by the effect it has on the people around you.\n- Don’t apply fragrance to your skin, apply it to your clothes – it will last longer.\n- Do remember that scent can work in [two] ways. While it can be beautiful, it can also be overpowering, so remember where you are.\n- Do layer more than one fragrance on your body to create a unique smell.\nThomas Kosmala Signature Collection is Dh995 at Harvey Nichols Dubai.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Where does Thomas Kosmala source his ingredients for his fragrances?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Thomas Kosmala sources his ingredients from all over the world, however they are processed at his factory in France.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Menopause and sleep disturbances impact biological aging\nMost of us know from experience that tossing and turning at night means feeling rotten the next day. And many of us understand that there are long-term health consequences when we’re short-changed on sleep.\nBut recently I found out something new from a fascinating study on sleep and its effect on how fast postmenopausal women’s genes age – which is known as their “epigenetic age.”\nIn the study, postmenopausal women with 5 insomnia symptoms were nearly 2 years older biologically than similar women with no insomnia symptoms. The more insomnia symptoms — waking up at night, not being able to fall back asleep, disturbed sleep and so on — the greater the effect. If you’re sleeping only 6 hours a night, however, it doesn’t seem to increase your epigenetic age — so long as it’s restful sleep. And that, of course, is where a lot of us have trouble.\nSo what can we do about all this? I like to point out that the research shows that our genes are not entirely out of our control, and we can influence how they respond by taking better care of ourselves. For those of us who are done with menopause and may be having trouble sleeping, this means looking at ways we can improve our rest.\n4 sleep tips to try\n- Keep a regular schedule. Your brain likes consistency, so go to bed by 11 and at the same regular hour each night and in a dark room.\n- Turn off the electronics! Computers, TVs, phones — they all are the enemy of sleep. Even a short duration of light shining in your eyes fools your brain into thinking it’s time to wake up. Shut down at least an hour before bedtime every night without fail, and put your phone on its charger in another room so you’re not tempted to look at it if you can’t sleep.\n- Eat early and moderately. Heavy meals too close to bedtime disrupt sleep, while avoiding caffeine and stimulations (like dramatic/stressful TV shows)\n- Keep relaxing once in bed. Once in bed, consider practicing relaxing abdominal breathing or guided visualizations like those of Yoga Nidra.\nYou can see more of my favorite sleep remedies in the checklist to the right, including adrenal-supporting Serinisol from Women’s Health Network.\nReference:\nCarroll, Judith E. et al.

THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.
Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.
Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.
“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.
“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”
High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.
The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.
The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.
Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.
“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.
He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”
This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.
See a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.

Perspectives
Reach and benefits:
- Self-supply is practised by millions of rural households in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as in Europe, USA and other areas of the world.
- Benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources include convenience, less time spent for fetching water and access to more and better quality water. In some areas, Self-supply sources offer important added values such as water for productive use, income generation, family safety and improved food security.
- Sustainability of services from Self-supply is high as there is strong ownership by people investing in own sources.
- As Self-supply sources are shared sources, many people, including poor and vulnerable households, benefit from investments in Self-supply, often at no costs. This means that Self-supply can be effective in reaching the hard-to-reach.
- For millions of people in rural areas of Africa, supported Self-supply will be the most cost effective service delivery model to provide access to safe water. This also includes those parts of the population which actually have poor access as they e.g. cannot afford water from communal supplies.
- However, in areas where external support for Self-supply is lacking, only marginal improvements can usually be achieved, and the quality of services is lower than in areas where a dedicated support effort was made.
Costs and business model for supported Self-supply
- In many rural contexts, supported Self-supply is the most cost effective approach for water service delivery. However, as it is not applicable in all contexts, a blended approach combining communal water supply and supported Self-supply models should be followed.
- Based on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis of different service delivery approaches, the LCC for communal supplies are about 40 US$/capita served in the study countries, whereas the LCC for supported Self-supply is about 10 U$/capita.
- In sparsely populated areas, communal supplies (e.g. handpumps) are even more costly (up to 100 U$/capita served) as only few people can be served with one additional unit. Serving all rural people with communal supply is therefore not financially viable.
- Considering the applicability of Self-supply technologies, in Zambia and Zimbabwe, the cost saving of following a blended approach using both communal supplies and supported Self-supply is almost 50% of the total LCC for reaching 100% of the population by 2030. These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US$ in Zambia and more than 260 million US$ in Zimbabwe.
Support services needed
- Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply, so it is not about a particular technology.
- Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation, which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water. However, supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties: Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally.
- To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement, capacity development at all levels, M&amp;E and technical support, reliable funding and learning and sharing.
- Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further, particularly in remote rural areas.
- There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme, it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact.
- Hygiene promotion, including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS), is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services, including Self-supply water sources.
- The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply. Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model, such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone, and in Ethiopia, Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level.

Description
Coolands for Twitter is a revolutionary twitter client. It has many unique features, gives you the best mobile twitter experience you never imagined before.
The first unique feature is Real-Time.
You can’t find any refresh button in this app, because you absolutely don’t need to. Every time you open it, you’ll get the latest tweets and while you’re reading, you’ll get incoming tweets in Real-Time. So if your friend mentioned you, you can reply instantly.
The second unique feature is Avatar Indicator.
Avatar Indicator is small avatars showed on the title bar to indicate that you’ve got new message/tweet/mention. Since it’s real-time, you’ll keep getting incoming tweets while you’re reading your older timeline, Avatar-Indicator will let you know who’s tweet you’ve just got, and decide whether to check it out right away.
The third unique feature is Direct Link
I think it is obviously the most intuitive and convenient way to open a link. When you want to open a link, just click it in the time line . You can also click a username to open a profile window, click a hash tag to open a search result window. Different kind of links displayed in different colors, you can change it to whatever color you like.
The fourth unique feature is Smart Bookmark
Have you ever experienced this scenario? When you are reading your home timeline, the app notified you that you’ve got some new tweets, you click “go-to-top” button to read the newest tweets, and then you want to get back to the previous position to continue your reading. How can you do this? In other twitter clients you have to scroll down all the way to find where you were, a lot of time wasted. But in this app, “go-to-top” button will appear when you scrolling up, click it, you can got to top, read the newest tweets. After that when you scrolling down, Smart Bookmark button will appear at the corner. Click it, you can get back to exactly where you were.
The fifth unique feature is User Level Notification
Notification for all your new tweets is meaningless, if you following more than a few users, you’ll get new tweets all the time. What if you only want to be notified when someone you most care about posted a new tweet? In this app, it’s easy. You can change your friend’s notification setting directly in his/her profile screen. You can also set different notification ringtone for your friends respectively. So when you heard a notification ringtone, you’ll know who he/she is without the need to open your phone. And you can manage all the enabled User-Level-Notification settings in one place.
Also has most of the basic twitter client features, like post/delete tweets, retweet, retweet with comment, reply, quote, send/delete direct message, subscribe/unsubscribe lists, follow/unfollow user, multiple accounts support, append picture with your tweets, mention auto complete, recent search auto complete, conversation view.

The question is simple, the answer is not.
For some 60 years, the only reliable information about India’s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).
For all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India’s population. India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries (that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s). But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it.
But the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics: NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth, and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India’s fast growth. This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton, Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, T.N. Srinivasan, S. Subramanian, Martin Ravallion and many others. Several representative articles are given here and here and here.
The gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes. The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean (presumably reflected in GDP per capita) and if surveys continued, partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate, to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution, that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts.
And if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.
And indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India’s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.
/>
But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.
And the results are very different from NSS’s. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini’s calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India’s inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.
For 2011, I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile (note that these are entirely different people though), the results do make sense. For the lowest percentiles, consumption is about twice income, and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income (which you would expect in a poor environment). After that point, consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income (that is, there is saving), so much that among the top 5%, income is twice as high as consumption (saving rate is 50%). Overall, the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS, and as we have said, Gini is some 15 points higher.
This “reasonableness” of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.
So if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.
There are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.
As mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?
Wrong.
What happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.
In conclusion, more unequal but richer India, makes the world more equal.

Round One:
Nelson in his usual Karate style stance keeps out of range of Cummings early strikes. Then he presses into the clinch, but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position. As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee.
Nelson lands a right hook. he misses with an overhand. Nelson very relaxed, but he’s very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough. A right hand counter lands for Nelson, but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up. Nelson turns though and then breaks away from the clinch.
A head kick is blocked by Cummings. Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds. Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body. More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch. Nothing doing and they back up. However, Cummings then comes back in and does finally land a few nice punches while Nelson has his back against the cage. Not for long though as Nelson circles out and that’s the final action of the round.
Round Two:
Nelson biding his time in the opening minute of the second as Cummings continually tries to land strikes, but generally comes up short. however, Cummings does back him up against the cage and unleash a flurry that foces Nelson to clinch.
They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage. Not much volume in Nelson’s striking so far this round, but he does land a speedy right hand that clearly hits the mark. Certainly better accuracy from him, but a little more offense wouldn’t go astray.
Again he finds a home for a clinical right hand. He starts to close the distance more now, but remains patient and just snaps off another quick right.
Into clinch range and Nelson reaches for a guillotine choke and goes to the mat with it. He fluidly switches on to Cummings back. He lands a few punches and then swiftly locks in a rear-naked choke.
Impressive stuff from Nelson in the way he was able to transition so slickly to his dangerous ground game and he forces Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining.</span></div></div>

The latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV
Over a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage. Then, a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode.
Dan Foley, the latest contestant voted off the island, says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain’s edit. But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been.
So what did we miss? Foley, a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine, was happy to tell us.
Okay, there are going to be some tough questions today, but let’s start with an easy one: what could you have done differently to keep from going home?
You know, it’s easy to be an armchair quarterback. If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol, I would have voted out Sierra.
You used your extra vote during the tribal council. Do you think that made you a target?
I said it before: superfans can’t do basic math. It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left. I wanted to play it when there was an even number. And what you didn’t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me. And then during Tribal Council, Will said, “If Dan has the advantage, he should use it.” It was the right time to play it.
Fair enough. So what was your reaction when you were voted out? Were you angry at Carolyn?
Look, anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn’t play the game. I left that game with a fever of expletives. They didn’t show it, but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed. I was absolutely furious, calling Mike every name in the book. But I don’t wish anyone ill will.
Okay, I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win.
They don’t.
They do.
No they don’t. Tony Vlachos was a backstabber, not a flipper.
Okay, but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice. She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10. Then, at Final 9, she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance.
But did she win?
Yes. She won the million. She beat Neleh Dennis.
Huh. Okay.
And Sandra Diaz Twine flipped multiple times to win.
Well, Sandra is a different case altogether. But Cochran flipped, and did that work for him?
No. No one says that all flippers don’t win. But flippers can and do win. Also, there was Danni Boatwright in Guatemala…
(Laughs) Yes, she played a good game. But I still believe that flippers don’t win. I really do.
Okay, let’s move on to the ugliness of the season. Your character was very difficult to root for.
I talked to Jeff Probst the other day and I ripped him a new one. I said, “You did me wrong. You did me dirty. You screwed me on my edit. You made me look like a piece of s—.” And Jeff said, “How do you figure?” And I said, “You cherry-picked things to show, sometimes out of context.”
Get a Tour of Jeff Probst’s ‘Spectacular’ Pad
I don’t know you. I only know the edited version of you. Are you saying that it was incorrect?When I am pushed, I push back. And I was pushed a lot. They didn’t show that. Lindsey, Sierra … they said things to me and pushed back. Look, I was always the fat guy. I learned how to stand up for myself. But you didn’t see what other people were saying or doing.
You took a lot of heat for your comments to Shirin.
Look, there’s not a single person on this season who didn’t say derogatory things about Shirin. Even Mike called her a man-hater. I made an unfortunate comment about slapping her. I had no idea about her past. None. Zero. I would never have made that comment. I apologize for saying it.
But at the same time, my comment was not meant literally. I meant it figuratively. How many times do you hear people say, “I could kill him.” Are they really plotting to kill someone? Of course not.
So where do things stand with Shirin now?
The truth of the matter is that we don’t get along. I don’t wish her ill or badly, and I hope nothing but the best for her. I hope that if she wants to go back on Survivor again, she gets that shot. There are things in her past that continue to haunt her to this day, and I hope that she gets the help that she clearly needs.
You were a big Survivor fan. Now that your reputation has taken a hit, are you still a fan of the show?
My reputation has not been harmed. The people who know me know that my edit was not who I really am. I don’t have a problem telling the truth. There are people who love me, and people who hate me. There is no real middle ground. the people who hate me can’t handle the truth.
But do you still love the show, or has your view been tainted?
How can you not have a tainted vision when you pull back the curtain and see that Oz is pulling on the levers? I’m a little disappointed, but I still love the show. Would I play it again? (Long Pause) Yeah. In a second.</span></div></div>

We have a quiet week as far as making dinner because we have lots of fun social plans, so we’re going to post a few lunch recipes too, just to keep things interesting.
We went to the Yankee game Sunday afternoon with our friends Jeff and Marie. As per usual, we ate our share of fun ballpark food, so we’ll have a little snack at most for dinner.
While Kim has a meeting at the New York Junior League on Monday, Tony will be out for dinner with his buddies, so Kim will be on her own once she gets home. While our dinner plans are different, we’ll probably have the same thing for lunch: The New York Times’ Green Garlic Tabbouleh. Kim made tabbouleh a few weeks go, but this recipes gives things a fun twist by using spring garlic, which is in season right now, but not for much longer.
Kim is going to a lecture Tuesday night and Tony will probably end up working late, so we’ll either meet up somewhere for dinner or just meet at home and order in. On Wednesday, Tony will be having dinner at a work event, so Kim will be on her own. Again, different dinners, same lunch, in this case The Minimalist Baker’s 30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry. We’ve found that despite Lent being long over, we’re still skewing pretty vegetarian/pescatarian, and this dish fits the bill, though Tony may add a little chicken to it to mix things up.
Kim will be back at the New York Junior League on Thursday, so Tony will be on his own for dinner. On Friday, we’re going to an event organized by Tony’s university alumni organization: an exhibit of the works of Robert Ryman to be held at the Dia:Chelsea on West 22nd Street. We’ve had a lot of fun at previous alumni events, so we’re looking forward to this one. We’ll probably grab dinner somewhere near the gallery.
We have tickets to the ballet on Saturday, but will probably have dinner at home in the form of Food 52’s Cilantro Lime Salmon Cakes with Chipotle Mayo. If you’ve been following our blog for the past few weeks, you might notice that this is the third time we’ve had the recipe on our weekly menu. We really want to make it, but just haven’t been able to get to it yet. We’re committed to making it this week though and know we will enjoy it!</span></div></div>

Hey Aaron! 10 years! Damn, I remember stumbling on this site while looking for an Aphex Twin review some 7 to 8 years ago, and since have been following your website weekly (in periods, even daily)!
So this is kinda sad news, even though there's a new site. But good to know everything stays up.
I wish you good luck on the new website and want to thank you with all the musical tips you gave me for all those years!
(Do Make Say Think, GYBE, Sigur Rós, Múm, Broken Social Scene, to name a few of the big ones)
kind regards Elwin

Hi, I've been a lurker of your site for 5 years. Thanks fot the great music you have directed me to..
Only one question: in your review of Wilco's YHF you said you would pay more attention to this group. But nothing has been reviewed since. What do you think of their later albums?
Good luck in your new occupations and happy 2009
Eric
I kind of felt this coming, so I'm not very surprised at all. Been hooked on this site since 2006/2007 but have kind of felt the general enthusiasm in your writing drop in the last half of this year. Really glad though that you let the year run to an end before putting the site to sleep. No need to drag it any longer if it's more of a chore than a joy.
Can't thank you enough for keeping this site running with new entries every friday. You know how to keep your readers and listen to them. ;) Musically, it has been an eye-opener into so much exciting stuff. Personally, it's been a very healthy road to follow and a sanctuary in the Internet chaos.
Looking forward to some action on the new site!
Cheers!

As a memorial, I'd love to see a list of the Top-however-many albums since starting the site -- 1996-2008 yes?
Sure, if we see ratings as immutable we could more or less do this ourselves, but I'm interested in how things have changed; would OKC and Agaetis Byrjun still top the list? What have you discovered long after its time?
This site has been a regular visit of mine since ... 2003 maybe? and it's been delightful to see how hard you work to promote bands that might not otherwise get noticed by anyone. At the same time, I absolutely see how the numerical rating bell curve can grow exhausting -- music writing was made to instill pleasure, to be a sprawling manifesto, to be something you want to do. I find if I can write at length about anything, I inevitably end up liking even the things that I might have reservations about. I really look forward to seeing where you go from here. Best!
Aaron
What are we gonna do with all these extra 7s we'll have laying around now???? :)
But seriously, the internet is a better place for this site. Sad to see it go, but I'm sure Something Excellent will carry the torch proudly.
David

As much as you’d like to think that you can handle your love and relationship problems on your own like a champ, it never hurts to get advice (or even an entirely different perspective) from people who have already been there, done that, and set up an appropriately themed podcast to talk about it.
But with the sheer number of love and relationship podcasts out there, you just can’t help but wonder: Which ones among them should you be listening to?
And frankly, does it even matter?
Seriously, how many different ways can people actually talk about such a universal and all-encompassing emotion as love?
As it turns out, quite a lot — and these five love and relationship podcasts are among the best and most unique ones out there.
Love Is Like A Plant with Sarah May Bates and Ellen Huerta
What do you get when you combine two experts on love and heartbreak in one podcast? An informative and in-depth conversation about planting the seeds of love in your life and making it last, no matter what kinds of challenges come your way.
Ellen Huerta, the creator of break-up support app Mend, teams up with Sarah May Bates, the self-improvement and emotional coping guru, on Love is Like a Plant. This one-of-a-kind podcast revolves around a single question: “If love is like a plant, how does one keep it alive?”
From defining a relationship to dealing with how to end it, Ellen and Sarah take listeners through a wide spectrum of love, sex, dating, and break-up advice, offering helpful advice and witty commentary along the way.
Relationships! Let’s Talk About It with Pripo Teplitsky
Relationships aren’t just about love or sex. From the way we talk to our siblings to how we cope with a dear friend who’s moving away, interpersonal relationships are rife with so many little issues and particulars that we sometimes get lost in the shuffle and forget the things that really matter.
Those small yet significant things are what psychotherapist and professional marriage and couples counselor Pripo Teplitsky tackles in each episode of Relationships! Let’s Talk About It. Pripo often has guests on his show with very interesting stories to tell.
Whether it’s a problem with your best buddy, your parents, your neighbor, or even your roommate, Pripo’s more than happy to talk about it—and even talk you through it.
Unqualified with Anna Faris
Some would look at a celebrity and wonder what a person who probably has everything she wants could ever offer in terms of relationship advice. After all, life’s generally a smooth cruise for these superstar types, right?
Actress, model, and author Anna Faris smashes that stereotype and serves up some delightful nuggets of wisdom in the amusingly titled podcast, Unqualified.
Anna features celebrity guests on her show, and asks about their personal lives in a way that’s both thorough and respectful. She’s also refreshingly open and honest, and is quite adept at keeping the mood fun without losing the emotions behind each story shared on the podcast.
Confessions of a Terrible Husband with Nick Pavlidis
The image of a husband in the proverbial doghouse, forced to spend the night lying on the living room sofa instead of beside his wife, is often played for laughs in pop culture. Author and motivational coach Nick Pavlidis, however, uses that mental image to deliver wise, honest, and hilariously self-deprecating stories revolving around the point when he realized that he was far from the ideal husband he’d thought himself to be.
Nick tackles an assortment of marital problems with the ease and expertise of a man who has spent one too many nights on a lumpy couch (and isn’t ashamed to admit it). On Confessions of a Terrible Husband: Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch, he shares his stumbles and challenges as a husband (which he jestingly calls “moron purgatory”), infused with advice from qualified relationship experts.
And yes, he will gladly help you pronounce his last name properly.
Savage Lovecast with Dan Savage
The name of this podcast works on so many levels. Not only does author and public speaker Dan Savage host the Savage Lovecast, but the subjects it deals with are also… savage, for lack of a better word.
Since 2006, Dan has been dishing out real talk on dating, sex, and love (even way before #realtalk or podcasts were a thing).
Whether it’s standard relationship stuff or more taboo topics that would make your parents and grandparents blush, Dan’s definitely got something substantial to say, delivered in an unapologetic and entertaining manner.
Your Turn!
These five love and relationship podcasts cover most if not all of the bases when it comes to romance, friendships, family, and the other interpersonal aspects of our day-to-day lives. Sure, it’s nice to have people to listen to us when we have relationship woes. You’ll find, though, that being on the listening end can be quite helpful, too — perhaps, even more than you may realize.

Over the race's first two days, the 365 athletes from 20 nations have competed in temperatures reaching 104 degrees, riding horses, mountain bikes, and riverboards in the Green River, trekking across the desert, and hiking through Utah's notorious slot canyons. The lead teams have covered roughly 200 miles; the teams at the back of the field are more than 75 miles behind. Gordon Wright sends us this from the race course.
This year's Primal Quest is so hot, so hard, and so long that race organizers have been largely concerned with what could go wrong. While heat stroke, dehydration and horseback riding injuries are relatively rare in most adventure races, they are real concerns in this one, as well as the more common issues such as injuries, exhaustion and logistical challenges.
This anxiety has been largely mitigated by the fitness of the competitors and the planning of the race staff. Astonishingly, only two teams have dropped out: Team Utah and Team xxTreme US. Both drop-outs bring surprises: Team Utah would seem to have a home-town advantage, but quit due to blisters and exhaustion. Team xxTreme US is largely comprised of Navy SEALs — notably hard men who were undone by injury.
"I don't think you could reasonably take 400 people off the streets — or even out of a gym — stick them in the desert for two days and expect them to survive," said Primal Quest Course Director Don Mann. "But these athletes are so fit they're not only surviving but making good progress."
Amid all the concern over the extraordinary heat and the capriciousness of the horses, a race broke out. Four teams ran and paddled neck and neck all throughout Day Two, never getting separated by more than twelve minutes. Among the leaders is Team Nike/Powerblast, the odds-on favorite led by defending champions Mike Kloser and Ian Adamson. Two teams led by women are also among the leaders: Team Merrill/Wigwam, captained by Robyn Benincasa and Team Spyder, captained by Danelle Ballangee.
What makes that top grouping interesting isn't just that they're led by women, but that Benincasa and Ballangee are former teammates of Kloser and Adamson. The reasons for Ballangee and Benincasa leaving their male teammates and starting their own teams are many, and while the racers proffer respect, hard feelings remain.
There is still more than 200 miles of racing to go - and the lead teams have logged only four to six hours sleep in more than three days. But what is clear is that the ghosts of teammates past are dogging Team Nike, and it doesn't look like they're going away any time soon.
Farther back in the pack, the pace was more stately, and the camaraderie much more present. Team Pedro's Boulders was preparing to launch its kayaks into the Green River for 35-mile paddling leg when field correspondent Bob Heady caught up to them.
Iona MacKenzie was stuffing her backpack into her kayak's hatch and painfully recalling Sunday's horseback section. Her horse stepped on her foot and broke a toe; she didn't realize the seriousness of the injury until the beginning of the eight-mile riverboarding segment. She was 108 miles into the race, and she couldn't pull her swim fin on.
MacKenzie's teammate Charlie Kharsa gave her one of his fins, which was a couple of sizes bigger, and that "solved" MacKenzie's problem.
Kharsa now had one fin that was two sizes smaller than his foot, but if anyone in the race could shrug it off, it's Kharsa, who several years ago completed a riverboard voyage down the length of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.
Team Semper Fi was also transitioning from riverboard to kayak. A group of U.S. Marine officers, the team has already made a large impression on the race. Blowing away stereotypes, the Marines are far from taciturn and decidedly not buttoned-up. In fact, they seem to be having a blast amid all the misery. One of the team members entered the riverboarding segment by tossing his board into the Green, sprinting down the beach, and hopping onto it for an impressive display of skim-boarding.
Brian Chontosh, who was awarded the Navy Cross for valor in Iraq in 2003, is reveling in a challenge that doesn't involve being shot at. Chontosh and teammate Kevin Saunders are both captains, and therefore lower-ranked than married team members Majors Sarah Fullwood and James Fullwood. When asked whether or not he and Saunders were getting along with their superiors, Chontosh joked, "We don't want to be anywhere near them — Kevin and I paddle together and plot against them."
This joking, fun-loving attitude has become a trademark for a group of competitors who, despite the gravity of their occupation, do not take themselves seriously. Chontosh also asked Heady to send a message to front-running Team Nike/Powerblast, "We've been taking it easy for a couple of days — and we're about to put the hammer down."
The merry Marines paddled away, 62 miles behind Nike, but with tremendous spirit.
Semper Fi.

Instead of crafting a quick story for a Wednesday’s Word post, I searched for a quote that might give color to the word. I found one that indirectly speaks to my desire to write and the courage it takes to keep me writing, even when the inspiration flickers out.
Today’s word:
quantum. noun.
1. A quantity or amount.
2. A portion.
3. A large amount.
4. The smallest amount of something that can exist independently.
, American business owner, career counselor, author.
A new year approaches. And,2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.
Don’t just imagine, Someday I’d like to be a writer.
Write.
Because “anything worth doing is worth doing…” now.
Interesting that you consider it courageous to keep writing even when you’re not inspired. I’ve never thought of writing as courageous … well, not fiction writing. I want to know more of your viewpoint.
I read that quote and immediately thought about the risk in writing.
For years I wanted to call myself a writer; I wanted to take the plunge. But I never ventured outside of my journal or a few personal letters that recounted a silly experience.
Starting a blog was taking a risk. Submitting my first piece (in it’s own infancy) was taking a risk.
It would be easy to imagine the smile on my face when that first novel is finished and published, instead of actually rewriting that novel to submittable quality. And, then sending it out into the query world.
And, I thought of your recent post (), and how even when I feel uninspired or unrecognized (with just one more rejection email to archive), I still write.
I’m in a weird mood, I guess, or maybe I’m completely missing your point, but I’m not being flippant.
Is what you feel you’re risking only the rejection of your work? I know it’s hard not to feel like a conjoined twin with your writing, but I’ve finally accepted that agents and editors are just businessmen and my work is only a product to them.
I realize, of course, for a writer who has to make a living from her writing, selling the product is extremely important. I don’t have to sell my work, so I’ve come to the point where I view the act of writing, the creation of story, as the valuable part … not the selling. So, in that sense, writing is not a risk to me.
I would like to share it, and so I will try to sell it, but if I never succeed, it does not diminish the accomplishment of writing a novel (or story), nor does that make me enjoy my work less.
I don’t think you’re being flippant. Maybe I’m not expressing myself well.
For me, the risk in writing comes in the act itself: to write is to make myself vulnerable, whether I write memoir or fiction, since each story I write reveals a small part of myself or my psyche.
The risk also comes in sharing that story (and that small piece of myself) with others, whether they pay to read it or not.
I hope that reads more clear than my first comment.
Ha ha, you were clear. I was trying to let you know I didn’t want you to think I was being flippant in the comment I was about to make.
I guess a year ago I felt like you. I’ve had enough experience in critique groups now that I don’t think of it as a risk to share my work. But I think I feel more separated from my work than you do.
Christi, I also feel the act of writing takes courage. For me, writing (including fiction writing) is often a painful, fearful experience. What I fear isn’t so much that others will reject me but that I will reject the parts of myself exposed in the writing process.
To be honest, I never thought, Someday I’d like to be a writer. Instead, I thought, Someday I’d like to stop lying to myself. A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
“2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.” Yes, and I like the clarity in this statement.
Ann, I love this: A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
Earning the right to say so aloud hits home with me. Thanks for your comment.</span></div></div>

In yet another curtsy to the politically correct orthodoxy, President Barack Obama’s.
And the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training is only the beginning. Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress that anti-Muslim instructional materials hurt the country’s fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. As a result of this mentality, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to collect counterterrorism training materials at all military academies and academic centers such as the National Defense Intelligence College and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center.
“The goal, evidently, is to banish any material that could be viewed as offensive to Muslims,” said the JW blog.
To fulfill this politically-correct mission, the FBI enlisted the Army Combating Terrorism Center at West Point to purge material that conflates terrorism with mainstream Islam, according to inside information cited in the Judicial Watch — arguably one of the most sympathetic lawmakers to Islamic causes — the event came in “response to the spike in anti-Muslim bigotry” and marked the first ever congressional hearing on Muslim civil rights.
It was Durbin who on the floor of the Senate in 2004 called U.S. soldiers Nazis, and detention centers such as Guantanamo Bay “gulags.” He later apologized, but his constituents were happy to hear him denigrating U.S. troops since his district has a very large Muslim population, according to news reports.
According to the Examiner, other Muslim outreach efforts under Obama included; Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano meeting to discuss national security matters with a group of extremist Muslim organizations including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the nation’s space agency (NASA) being ordered to focus on Muslim diplomacy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing a special order to allow the reentry of two radical Islamic academics whose terrorist ties long banned them from the U.S.</span></div></div>

Cab Kapow!
4 May 2012
With the rain in London just refusing to stop, a story partly set in London, a narrator guided by a London mini-cab driver, well, we thought where better to film Adam Thirlwell talking about his new book Kapow! than in the back of a London cab?
Kapow! A Great Story. That is Also Great Looking
26 April 2012
So we realised that we’ve been banging on about how Great Looking our new book, Kapow! by Adam Thirlwell is, but not sharing too much about the Story itself. Which aside from being Great Looking, is also seriously Great. It’s the kind of can’t put it down even though the bath water’s turning cold and your skin’s going all crinkly kind of Great. The need to pee but you keep reading on with ever more crossed legs kind of Great.
Kapow! in Pics
20 April 2012
Advance copies of Kapow! by Adam Thirlwell landed in our studio on Monday, quite fittingly chiming with the start of the London Book Fair. And boy oh boy are we excited. The book feels real, is beautiful to hold and touch, it works and is giving people the giggles in all the right places. So far.
Houston, We Have a Cover. Houston, We Have Stopped Falling

Okay, so this week we went beyond falling off the production cliff and we just kept falling. We thought we had tried it all before with Tree of Codes. What could be more difficult, right. Alas, we were proved wrong by Kapow! (fitting, really, for a book with that title too).
What Is it About Book Covers?
12 March 2012
We’ve all been working overtime (sleepless nights, shower epiphanies, five minute naps sitting upright) on Adam Thirlwell’s Kapow! And we’re nearly nearly there. The inside is pretty sorted. It’s beautiful. And insane. And everyone’s feeling it.

Gearing Up and Going Out
17 February 2012
We’ve always been suckers for putting a bit (a lot, if we’re honest) of loving into everything we do. And yesterday was more of just that with an old school production line printing, folding, trimming press releases to send out announcing our new book by Adam Thirlwell.

It’s true, sometimes they do. And this week it feels like it. They can even happen in three’s, that’s for sure:
A Year of Revolutions
13 January 2012
We know we’ve been pretty quiet on the “hey hey, we’re back from the holidays” front.
But it’s not because we’re still rubbing the sofa-telly-over-eating/drinking/sleeping/skating/playing out of our eyes, but because we’ve well and truly landed in 2012 with our foot on the accelerator planning the launch of our fourth book, by Adam Thirlwell, out this coming May.

Remember those contracts we had designed and put a lot of love into a few weeks ago? We did a lot of talking about the contracts, but not much talking about who the contracts were with. Well, they’re all signed and the ink’s just about dry, so we can now tell you that we’ll be working with Adam Thirlwell on a brand new book due to come out early next year.
A new VE in the making
17 March 2011
We’ve just biked over author contracts for a new book. And we’re very, very excited. Giddy even. Before we tell you who it’s with (we’ll wait for the ink to dry before we do), we wanted to tell you a little something about the contract itself.</span></div></div>

Morganite is a pastel-coloured crystal, found in subtle shades of pink, lilac pink and salmon pink. It is usual for these gems to be light in colour, even though some are known to exhibit rich tones. It is a variety of the mineral beryl that also includes emerald and aquamarine.
Morganite was discovered in the early 1900’s in California and thereafter in Madagascar. Known initially as pink beryl, the crystal was renamed morganite in recognition of the financier and gem collector J.P. Morgan. The gem is also known as ‘pink emerald’ and ‘rose beryl’.
These stones are comparatively free of inclusions. The availability of huge Morganite rough allows for the possibility of large faceted crystals. The Brazilian stones can weigh more than ten kilograms.
Metaphysical Meaning
Morganite crystals have been linked to the heart
As a result of its subtle tone of pink, morganite crystals have been linked to the heart. For this reason, morganite rings serve excellently as engagement rings. It has been referred to as the Crystal of Eternal Love.
The vibrationsof morganite subtly heals the heart and opens it to unconditional love, repressed feelings and emotional needs that have not been fulfilled.
Morganite’s energy is also linked to the love of the Heavenly, teaching us that we are all linked to a Universal Heart and form part of a broader design.
Morganite is a symbol of beauty
Morganite crystals are great symbols of beauty. They help one to see the beautiful things in life, the energies of which one could absorb into oneself. The love energy of morganite is said to make its wearer more beautiful both mentally and physically.
The gem with exceptional powers
Gemstones of the beryl group have exceptional powers, which means that the properties of Morganite are superior. These crystals are known to aid further in other aspects of spiritual advancement.
Allow the Crystal of Eternal Love to work its magic for you
The vibration of love provoked by Morganite is extremely powerful. As long as the crystal is within your aura, it has an opportunity to work its magic.
So, treat yourself from the remarkable collection of morganite designs from Eldorado Diamonds. Designs that have been specifically selected to deliver to its wearer strong heart-centred energy.

The School of Journalism sponsors several student organizations, including chapters of national organizations. Our student organizations are quite diverse and give aspiring journalists the opportunity to learn, create and socialize with fellow students who share their interests. They gain knowledge about their future profession through hosting guest speakers, social events and hands-on experience.
The officers of these organizations do all of the footwork for bringing in guest speakers; these events are open to the public and university. The organizations host social events that foster communication with other students who share their specific interests. Meeting times listed below are subject to change. Please check the Web site listed or contact the advisor for any changes in meeting times or information about upcoming events.

ORANGE Magazine
ORANGE, UT's student magazine, gives students a hands-on approach to magazine publication. The staff works on all sides of a magazine from advertising to editorial, production to writing, and finances to public relations. After working on ORANGE, the staff leaves with a strong portfolio and enough experience to tackle any one of New York's leading titles.
The Magazine Club (MAG)
The MAG Club in the School of Journalism is designed for those interested in a career in magazines. The club is a great place to begin, a low-pressure way to get your feet wet --- much more social than work!
Scheduled meetings are held each semester, usually once every three weeks with local professionals to discuss their experience in the field, bring in local magazine editors, often our own graduates to discuss magazine careers, and keep a running list of the latest internships and possible jobs.
MAG is one of the few UT Sponsored Organizations on campus, so it is much more than just a "club." We also have a working relationship with ED on Campus, the national college magazine club, founded by NYC magazine editors. We will show you how to tie into their national job bank and intern listings.
MAG can also help you, at an early stage here, gain valuable hands-on experience with ORANGE, the campus magazine produced by School of Journalism students. But most importantly, we are just a group of people all working together to achieve success in the magazine industry!
MAG also looks great on the resume. Check the display box for MAG (and ORANGE) on the 6th floor of the College of Communication Building) for more details.

When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.
The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.
On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”
What to Do
- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.
- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.
- Don’t be scared to set limits.
- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.
- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.
- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.
- Be a role model for your teenager.
- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.
- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.
- Never use physical or mental torture.
- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.
- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!
In the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..</span></div></div>

Designed with both formal and nonformal educators in mind, the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth. This certification program is relevant for anyone who educates about an aspect of the environment, would like to strengthen their environmental or pedagogical expertise, and is passionate about professionalism in environmental education.
It has been developed with the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) accreditation program in mind. That means you can trust in the quality of materials and the learning process of the program, and once accredited, your certification will be transferable to any state with an NAAEE accredited program.
_____________________________________________________
From NAAEE: "Professional certification ensures that individuals are fully prepared for work within a specific field of expertise. Certified environmental educators meet stringent requirements for proficiency in both the interdisciplinary content and pedagogy necessary to develop and deliver high quality, effective EE programs.
While it is not necessary to attain certification in order to be employed as an environmental educator, certification readily distinguishes highly qualified professionals and enhances the resumes of those who have attained it. Having a community of certified professionals also elevates respect for the profession."

I want to start the program, but I have already completed the previously released Criteria 1. Do I have to do it again?
Criteria 1 has seen minimal changes, and you can submit the work that you have already completed as soon as you have access to Canvas. Please note that some new assignments may have been added to Criteria 1, and they will be most useful, so be sure to look for those and complete those as well.
I enrolled in the certification program in 2019. What can I expect?
Candidates who paid to enroll in the certification program in 2019 are permitted to submit Criteria 1, 3, and 4 work that was completed as early as one year prior to their original enrollment date. This is an exception for the 2019 cohort. Also, candidates who completed the “Professional Development of Environmental Educators” workshop will be able to check that off of their accomplishments. Likewise, if those same candidates also subsequently took the “Methods of Environmental Education” workshop, you have also received credit for that part of Criteria 2. Contact certification@virginiaee.org to learn your status. Candidates who paid their initial application fee in 2019 will not be required to pay another application fee.
Acknowledgements:
The VAEE would like to extend its heart-felt thanks to the volunteers who serve on the Certification Advisory Board (CAB) for their dedication to carrying the dream of a Virginia EE Certification program forward. Certification program development was begun by the Virginia Office of Environmental Education, but when it was closed in 2016, the VAEE chose to continue this work. A couple of intrepid volunteers kept the process going, and soon the CAB was formed and started on the path to making Virginia EE Certification a reality.</span></div></div>

These sites continue to be meaningful to Native peoples and are considered sacred to those whose tribes were forced from Ohio long ago. These monumental works of archaeoastronomy and landscape architecture bear remarkable testimony to the multifaceted genius of aboriginal North Americans in the Ohio Valley and to an artistic and cultural flowering that had significant impacts all across the continent between 900 and 2,600 years ago. Inscription on the World Heritage List would underscore the cultural significance of these sites and call international attention to these treasures long known to Ohioans.
The Nomination Process
The U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service control and guide the process that culminates in a nomination of these sites to UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization – which administers the World Heritage List.
Currently the – Fort Ancient in Warren County, the Newark Earthworks in Licking County, and the earthworks included in the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.
The Need for Support
A working group of archaeologists, anthropologists, architects, cultural landscape historians, museum and park administrators, and Native Americans are collaborating to complete a draft of this document for review by the National Park Service before a final submission can be made to UNESCO. Funding is needed to continue the progress toward the completion of the draft nomination: consulting with other World Heritage sites and nominee organizations and other experts; performing additional research; compiling all required data; formulating required management plans; developing economic impact studies, and designing the draft document. The experience of other successful U.S. and international applicants for inscription indicates that preparation of the nomination requires at least one full time staff person and – in addition to the contributions of the working group - the services of various consultants, researchers, photographers, graphic designers, and editors. Therefore, we estimate that an investment of between $800,000 and $1,200,000 may be necessary to document the significance of our sites and how they will be managed, in a comprehensive and appropriate manner designed to elicit favorable consideration by UNESCO.

The CBC is reporting today on a survey done late last year that indicates Canadians aren't as healthy as they think they are. Just over 2000 Canadians were polled; 1514 adults and 506 youth. You can find the PDF online and follow along with me wh…

to raise £40,000 in 40 days, our fabulous new village
hall was opened. Find out more about this remarkable journey
to keep the 100-year-old building at the heart of our community,
and ready for another century of work.
While it may have been a big achievement from the outset,
it was one which received overwhelming and essential
support from a number of trust funds, including the Big Lottery
in Scotland.
It's a remarkable achievement after 15 years of work for
a group of dedicated volunteers who have remained committed
to dragging the historic building and community amenity firmly
into the 21st century. In the words of the committee, a 'new
and exciting facility' has been created to replace the 'much-loved
but decrepit building' that has in the past excluded a proportion
of the community due to its lack of modern-day amenities.
The transformation of the hall into a vibrant, multi-activity
centre for the whole community is now no longer a pipedream.
The entire project didn't come cheap, however. But thanks
to an extensive round of fundraising initiatives, such as
music nights and raffles and donations from a number of local
and national funds, and drawing on the infallible enthusiasm
and commitment for the regeneration project to succeed, work
started on site in the summer of 2007. This was in no small way
due to the amazing, worldwide response to an 11th hour appeal
to raise a spectacular £40,000
in 40 Days by the deadline of 30th June.
To all those who donated to the £40,000 in 40 Days Appeal - thank you! We couldn't have done it without you.

Hello everyone,
I have a question about CAN interface PXI-8512. I have two chassis with PXIe 8880 controllers and with PXI-8512 interface modules.
I need to exchange data between those two PXI 8880 controllers and the question is if I can use PXI-8512 modules to send and receive data with CAN protocol? The data is from third part custom device (vehicle simulator). If it is not possible, how can I exchange data between two controllers?
Thank you for answer.
05-10-2017 05:34 AM
Hello krzesniak1,
the direct answer to your question is yes, you can use CAN to share data between your controllers.
In my opinion it is not the best way though. If the controllers are networked, you can use shared variables (network-published) as explained in this white paper:
THis will give you a smoother programming experience and more flexibility than CAN. Obviously, it may be better to use CAN if you want this data to be a part of a bigger system that uses this communication protocol.
As an unrelated tip, it is best to think of PXI controllers as computers, so you can use any way of communication you would normally use between two computers (TCP, ftp, UDP etc.)
Best Regards,
Nick

Thank you for your advice. However I also use VeriStand to deploy a project and I am not sure how to use a shared variables with VeriStand. I also tried with udp communication, however I did not succeed.
Do you know may be an example where communication between two PXIs is well explained?
Best regards,

Roberto Alagna – My Life Is An Opera (2014)
FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time – 00:57:23 minutes | 1,05 GB | Genre: Classical, Opera
Studio Master, Official Digital Download – Source: prestoclassical.co.uk | © Deutsche Grammophon
Recorded: AIR Studios (Londres) du 1er au 6 septembre 2014 et à Abbey Road Studios (Londres) le 8 Septembre 2014
Roberto Alagna is THE most well-known French tenor worldwide, with 30 years of career on stage, and 60 opera roles in his repertoire. For this all-new album, he sings selections both familiar and less well-known as well as duets with soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. Highlghts include selections from I Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Roberto Devereux and many more.
A cynic might look at Roberto Alagna’s new disc, ‘My Life is an Opera’, and think, ‘At least he admits it’. From his stormy La Scala stage departure to his relationship with Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna’s personal life is…well, operatic. Somewhat embarrassingly, the disc’s booklet has each of the arias listed (out of order from their disc sequencing) to illustrate some signpost in his life, though instead of dealing with the aforementioned incidents in this loose autobiography, the text speaks of the ‘meteoric’ rise of this ‘golden-voiced handsome young genius’. (Oh dear.)
But anyone who thought the medium-weight Alagna voice was on the way out with his Radamès and Otello might be dumbfounded at his excellent state of vocal health on the disc, and the sure dramatic instincts behind it. Most of the repertoire seems new to Alagna’s discography, though there are very few signs of having just learnt arias from Gluck’s Orfeo, The Queen of Sheba (both the Gounod and Goldmark versions) and Reyer’s Sigurd.
Aside from forays into Puccini’s Manon Lescaut and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci, the programme seems to signify a re-commitment to his fundamentally mid-weight lyric vocal personality, not playing safe in the way he builds phrases and longer-term musical climaxes but rarely pushing his limits (the closest he comes is in an excerpt from his brother David Alagna’s opera Le dernier jour d’un condamné ). Lensky’s aria from Eugene Onegin is in French translation, not Russian. Bel canto choices such as the dramatically charged duet from Roberto Devereux (with Aleksandra Kurzak) don’t require serious coloratura.
The biggest vocal surprise is ‘Magische Töne’ from the Goldmark Sheba, in which Alagna goes into the falsetto stratosphere with a musico-dramatic effect that stands well alongside performances by the great tenors of the past, including Nicolai Gedda and Leo Slezak. Alagna doesn’t have a particularly strong-minded collaborator in the London Orchestra (an ensemble I’ve never heard of) and its Director Yvan Cassar. But recorded sound is first-class. –David Patrick Stearns, Gramophone

With the start of a new school year coming up, teachers are tasked with creating a meaningful learning experience for their deaf and hard of hearing students for the upcoming year. Doing this while navigating Coronavirus is especially challenging. Many have been asked to plan for a semester that accommodates hybrid learning or the flexibility of transitioning from in-person to digital learning at a moment’s notice.
This coming Fall, a teacher’s responsibilities will extend far beyond restructuring their curricula. We know that teachers have an important impact on a child’s mental/physical health, social well being, and more. With everything that our students have been dealing with since March, this impact is more important than ever. Balancing all of these responsibilities, with new school guidelines, in addition to protecting their own health is a lot for one person to handle.
We at CSD Learns want to ease that burden.
CSD Learns STEM Toolkits Are the Adaptable Resources You Need
We have worked with subject matter experts to create a series of STEM Teacher’s Toolkits to use in elementary, middle, and high school. These toolkits are easy to implement online, in-person – or both simultaneously.
Featuring deaf and hard of hearing role models, each toolkit provides educators with several weeks’ worth of lessons (in ASL) that students will love. Each free toolkit has videos, interactive activities, quizzes and more. Keep reading to find the perfect toolkit for your classroom.
Teach Your Middle Schoolers to Stay Safe Online
With our students spending so much time online –even more now with virtual learning – it’s important they know how to stay safe.
Our Developing Your Cybersense Toolkits, created in partnership with RIT/NTID, provide you with four weeks of lessons on cybersecurity. Your students will learn about topics like information security, digital footprints, social media use, and fake news from four deaf and hard of hearing role models.
Inspire your High Schoolers to Pursue a Career in STEM
Did you know that deaf and hard of hearing workers who pursue STEM careers earn up to 30% more than deaf workers in non-STEM careers? In addition to that, STEM careers are projected to grow by nearly 9% over the next eight years. It’s the perfect time to be encouraging students to pursue and education in STEM.
Our “Immersion in STEM” series highlights careers in four different areas of STEM; immunology, nanoengineering, programming, and statistics. Your high schoolers will learn about what it takes to have a successful career in STEM from four pros who’ve been there before!
Pique Your Elementary Students’ Interest in STEM
It’s never too early for your students to start learning about their immune system, how their computers work, why math is important, what goes into the technology they use every day – and more.
Our “All About STEM” series covers important foundational concepts in immunology, programming, statistics, and engineering, all in a way that will excite and engage your younger students.

this is so so so so so lovely
GOSH this is incredibly gorgeous, I’ve always loved the palace as a local but this shoot is drool worthy! Would have loved if they featured the grounds a bit more. Stunning
FABULOUSLY DONE, the cakes r the best of all 4 me followed by the decorations n settings. Overall, its really beautiful.
Very nice and clear picture …… Thumbs up to Mr Alakija again
The only down side, the wedding gowns are so outdated and not trendy ……. Hardly any of the wedding dresses made me say “awwwwwww”
The wedding gowns are in the 90 s so i am a bit confused as this is 2013 …. Those gowns are at best HIDEOUS and take away from the wonderful skills of the photographer. As in seriously who will wear those gowns now for their wedding . The styles are very outdated
Thot I was the only one not seeing “the light”
My sista May God bless you!!!!
The dresses are sooooooo… ugly it is unbelievable. The deco is great, but that’s because it’s in hand and the venue is beautiful.
The cakes are just okay, the gold trimmings on the cake are not smooth, could be better. A little OTT for me.

This will make you wanna spend money.Classy, Royal, Splendid.
Always fabulous work when it comes to these guys, they are masters of their craft. Inspiration mode activates. Those table layouts are just mwah!
Please apart from the wedding cakes, the dessert table which were certainly impeccably done, the rest of it was blah to me. The tablecloths looked rumpled and frumpy; the wedding dresses not so fabulous, I was actually disappointed.
Please who wears braids on their wedding day??? Let alone very old braids?
There is no inspiration here, nothing I can take away from the photos and nothing that will make me want to contact any of the vendor.
I know plenty people who have worn braids on their wedding day my cousins included. That most Nigerian brides don’t doesn’t mean that the rest of Africa and black female population does not. Not old ones like these I am talking about three day old beautifully styled braids, And aren’t sisters who where locs also braided in a sense and they wear their hair like that for their weddings.

Diseased Body in Wuthering Heights
In Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte it can be viewed that there is “more suffering caused by a diseased mind than by a diseased body.” The idea of a “diseased mind” is a mental illness or madness and the “diseased body” is a physical illness or injury, both of which are displayed by many characters in Wuthering Heights.
Heathcliff is a prime example of a character with a “diseased mind” that causes him suffering. He spends the majority of his life contemplating and acting out revenge towards Hindley and the Lintons because he believes it was their fault Catherine thought it would “degrade” her to marry Heathcliff, even though she loved him; this is one example of his unstable mind set. In chapter 9 Nelly foreshadows the suffering of Heathcliff by saying “if you [Catherine] are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature,” this is because Nelly understands that society wouldn’t accept the pair to marry, therefore Heathcliff will be unfortunately heartbroken. Heathcliff believes that Catherine is a part of him: “I cannot live without my soul,” he says which highlights that he is suffering without her. It is from this heartbreak and suffering that his “diseased mind” commenced. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” heightens when he asks for Catherine to “haunt” him when she is dead; haunting is an element of the Gothic genre but the madness of Heathcliff is enhanced when he requests that Catherine drives him “mad.”
The word “mad” is ambiguous in this quotation because it could be viewed that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is angry with Catherine so he can destroy his love for her. An alternative view is that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is insane and suffering since he is desperate to see Catherine, this becomes true because after Catherine’s death Heathcliff’s mind is haunted by his love for her. Jerold E. Hogle explains this is accurate because characters in Gothic novels are “haunted psychologically” and this is accurately shown through the character of Heathcliff. His mind is “diseased” by his separation from Catherine due to her choice of partner and her death, which causes him and everyone in the novel immense suffering because of his vengeance.
Heathcliff’s unconditional love causes Catherine’s “melancholy” “mental state” because it is overwhelming and she is in love with him but a Victorian society wouldn’t accept their relationship because of the Heathcliff’s very low class, which would result in them being “beggars.” Catherine has “a peculiar expression arising from her mind set” before she tells Heathcliff “you have killed me,” this highlights her “diseased mind” and the suffering it is causing her because she hasn’t died yet but it could be interpreted that she feels as though she has which emphasises her suffering, but also her madness. The “peculiar expression” that Catherine is described to have could be because she was “thinking… of Wuthering Heights.”
The “expression” could be interpreted as a smile, which would be “peculiar” to Nelly because she has been depressed living with Edgar, therefore a smile would be unusual; David Punter explains “Gothic reminds us we are driven by our passions” and Catherine’s passion is Heathcliff, which would explain her “expression” when thinking about Wuthering Heights. This idea of Catherine’s thought process in her “diseased mind” emphasises her pain and suffering because she cannot be without Heathcliff, her “soul,” yet she is continuously thinking about him, this is essentially what drives her insane.
Catherine’s mental suffering is closely linked with her physical suffering which is an example that represents the “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights. Another character with a “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights is Isabella, whose “bruised” body is a valid example of suffering. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” causes him to abuse Isabella which leads to her suffering and her injured body

Don't stress about what you need to buy for your mother's special occasion; for most Mum's the best present is your presence.
Yes it's that simple, just spend time with her, no store bought card, bunch of flowers or chocolates will warm her heart as much as any small efforts to show her how much she is appreciated.
To help here are 5 ideas to choose from which are sure to make your Mum feel special and happy.
1. As I mentioned presence is key, Mum was born before the information age, she misses the simplicity of these times. Go old school, put your phone away and have a good old chat with your Mum. Share something significant that's going on in your life and then ask her what it was like for her at your age. Her memories of this time are really vivid and you are likely to have some similar experiences to draw upon.
2. Go on a road trip together. Listen to music, chat and explore somewhere neither of you have been before.
3. Your Mum is going to love and cherish any home made gifts. She will spill over with joy knowing that you took some time to think about her.
- Make a card, or art piece, write a poem or a story.
- Make her a movie or a photo collage.
- Make a playlist of all the songs she loves.
4. Do something you love with your Mum. Dance, yoga, art, cycling.... if you are passionate about it, then your Mum will love this glimpse into your world.
Last but not least...
5. The thing that will totally make your Mums day is to tell her you love her, let her know you appreciate all she has done for you and that you value her little pearls of wisdom.</span></div></div>

He received a BS degree in pharmacy from the University of Wisconsin and a MS and PhD in pharmaceutical administration from the Ohio State University. He has practice experience in both independent and chain community pharmacy settings. He teaches courses in pharmacy management, business planning for professional services, and drug literature evaluation. His research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists. ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completing this chapter, readers should be able to Define the terms management and manager. Describe how concepts in management figure into our everyday lives. Compare and contrast management and leadership. Compare and contrast classical views of management with modern views. Describe the management process within the contexts of what managers do, resources they manage, and levels at which managers perform their roles. Integrate modern views of management with the management process. Apply the management process to all personal and professional activities. ++ SCENARIO ++ Krista Connelly is a second-year pharmacy student. Like most second-year students, she describes her life as “incredibly stressed out.” A typical day consists of getting up at 6 am, getting dressed and running out the door by 7 am, and driving to school to get to her first class by 8 am (making sure to avoid the accident on the expressway that she heard about on her way out the door). While at school, she finds time to squeeze in cups of coffee and snack bars between the lectures, labs, and workshops that usually last until at least 4 pm. She also makes a point to go to the library to prepare upcoming assignments, as well as to meet with her professors to review how she did on her examinations. ++ After class today, Krista has an Academy of Students of Pharmacy (ASP) meeting. Krista is the president of her chapter and works with committee chairs to accomplish the goals of the organization. In the past few weeks, she has helped the new professional service chairperson develop a diabetes screening program, talked her fundraising chairperson out of quitting, and wrote a report on each committee’s activities for the chapter website. While Krista enjoys her leadership role in ASP, she finds some of the people she works with to be frustrating and wonders how she can motivate them to do a better job. ++ After her meeting, Krista drives to a fast-food restaurant to grab a quick dinner on her way to her part-time pharmacy intern job. If she is not working, she will head to a friend’s house to study for an upcoming examination. She usually gets back to her apartment by 10 pm and mentally prepares for what she needs to</span></div></div>

Compassion &amp; Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee made a comment during an end-of-life (EOL) panel discussion that resonated fully: to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”
Think about this. Redefine the standard of care at end of life.
This compact statement is everything required to support us all in achieving the peaceful demise virtually all of us say we want, yet barely an inverse number achieve. It’s so simple, and so profound.
Barbara’s phrase takes the act of redefining language—my launching point when conceiving and discussing how to advocate when hospitalized, and how to achieve a peaceful demise—to a fully dimensional place. Because language, no matter it’s power, is less dimensional than action. Language, as powerful as it is in framing our expectations and thoughts, merely informs action. Action in medicine equals treatment. Treatment is fully dimensional. We act on language; we experience treatment. We die, and survivors live, with the results of treatment choices we make, or fail to make.
The advent of life support technologies in the 1960s and development of a home for them (the intensive care unit, or ICU) has its clinically logical extension in the chronic ICU facility, with floors of beds for dozens or hundreds of comatose bodies maintained on life support).
Applying this technology endlessly, some would say mindlessly, at the end of life has evolved into the standard of care. But by whose definition?
The irony of American culture is that we seem to pay homage to the notion of individuality yet in many matters, especially how we exit this planet, we traipse along like lemmings. Medicine has defined the EOL standard of care. By and large citizens have acquiesced to medicine’s definition, even with survivors from family after family recoiling from their experiences.
My mantra bears repeating: we actually have to do something in order to increase the likelihood of dying in peace. I begin to articulate what it is we must do here and here.
Part of my language assessment is that our experience of treatment does not feel like or equate to care. Yet providers believe that the treatment they offer equals care. Now, we’ll never strip the letters ‘care’ from the healthcare conversation, for evident reason. But we can examine and clarify obfuscating language so as not to lose the first week of a terminal (or any) hospitalization to bewilderment over what is not happening and what is happening.
What constitutes the standard of care has been invisible, like the air in a flotation device. The device is nothing without the air, yet we never think or speak in terms of that air, only the floaty. But redefining the standard of care is something we can act on and influence. Because that’s about agreement, and consent or refusal to consent. That’s our personal, social, and legal right. The right to informed consent at end of life is being slowly codified into law. But that’s all about the provider side. What about the citizen side?
THE missing voice from panel after panel about EOL matters is ours: citizens’. By “citizens” I mean informed citizens; patient-family members who’ve been through the forest and have mapped it. Articulate people who’ve transformed from harmed persons into patient advocates or activists. We have insightful comments to add because we have deeply parsed the kinds of experiences you really do not want your patient-family to have.
We’re out here. Some, like me, have been recognized by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a well-respected non-profit responsible for significant advances inpatient safety. Redefining the standard of care requires more than panels of medical and policy experts with no informed citizen representation.
Patient advocates bring a different voice to the conversation. I suspect our voice is regarded as scary by panel hosts (if not many panelists) because it necessarily comes from gut level. This implies real feeling, but does not imply craziness. Ours is the voice of passionate clarification, not the dispassionate voice of the clinic or the legislature.
The simple truth is this: including the informed citizens’ voice in every panel discussion is the first step towards redefining the end-of-life standard of care.</span></div></div>

The sequence of events began when the suspect, 30-year-old Henry Brown, hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant. Records indicate that their marriage had been rocky ever since his wife, 31-year-old Chericia Brown, had an injunction issued in January following a domestic battery report from the month before.
Upon leaving the restaurant around 10 p.m., Chericia was rushed by Henry, who had been lying in wait, and stabbed multiple times. The attack prompted a nurse and paramedic, who were dining at the establishment, to come and help, but that's when Henry returned to the scene in a bid to finish the job by running her over - and hitting the two good Samaritans in the process.
Afterward, Henry drove to Alamonte Springs and changed vehicles to a Ford F250. While there, he also picked up his two children - a 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son - from the babysitter.
With the two in tow, he headed to Central Florida Regional Hospital in search of his wife, but security and witnesses recognized him, prompting him to pull out his gun and open fire on law enforcement and security personnel in an attempt to flee. Deputies said they returned fire, but were unable to prevent him from fleeing to Interstate 4.
He drove westbound along the interstate, eventually being discovered by police near the Seminole-Volusia county line just minutes later. Deputies successfully used stop sticks to slow Henry's vehicle down, but upon closing in to arrest him, they found him as well as his two children dead inside.
Investigators said they believe Brown killed his children at some point after picking them up, then committed suicide while police prepared to apprehend him.
As if that wasn't bad enough, at some point during the night, Chericia died at the hospital from her injuries.
I-4 near the St. Johns River Bridge was shut down for hours after the incident, but has since reopened.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting at the hospital.</span></div></div>

Originally published Wednesday, April 1, 1992 in the International Herald Tribune
As the costs of unification prove more of a strain on Berlin’s finances than the expense of maintaining a divided city ever did, political and business leaders are counting on a major economic expansion to ease the pressure.
They believe that the German government’s decision to move from Bonn to Berlin will attract business and generate tax revenues in a way that was never possible during the Cold War years. But before the city is able to cut its dependence on federal government funds, it is receiving lavish sums to help it pay for the overhaul of East Berlin’s rotting infrastructure and the merging of its eastern and western halves into one modern city.
Of its total 1992 budget of 41.88 billion Deutsche marks (about $25 billion), Berlin will receive 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, raise 13 percent through new borrowing and generate 26 percent through taxes.
Finance Senator Elmar Pieroth said the debt level, one that would be considered irresponsible under normal circumstances, was unavoidable given the magnitude of the job to be done.
“We have no other choice,” he said in an interview. “We can’t build the Wall back and make the East stay at the level it is today.”
East Berlin’s needs range from sewer equipment to telecommunications systems and include just about everything in between. Both East and West Berlin need housing, efficient power generating and distribution equipment, and better road connections to each other and the rest of Germany.
While it is clear that many improvements have already been made – public transportation runs efficiently between East and West and the phone lines across town are no longer as impossibly busy as they once were – there remains more work to be done than originally estimated. The Berlin and German governments have already begun negotiations to extend payments from the special German Unity Fund beyond the planned cutoff date of 1995. Also being discussed is the timetable for the federal government’s move to Berlin. While Berlin is lobbying for it to take place as soon as possible, the federal government seems to want to postpone both the move and the accompanying bills until the late nineties.
Earlier this year, Bonn even floated a trial balloon, suggesting some ministries should remain where they are.
“The move is more difficult than expected,” said Siemens AG Vice President Joachim Putzmann, chief of the electrical and electronics company’s Berlin administration. While he is optimistic about Berlin’s future, Mr. Putzmann said there are still very few decision-makers in the city and German business needs to see the government back in Berlin before it relocates key people and operations.
The pace of Berlin’s expansion will be partially reflected in the growth of the city’s taxes, which are targeted to triple to 18.5 billion marks in 1995 from 6.09 billion marks in 1990. Mr. Pieroth said 4 billion marks of the increase will come from new economic activity in East Berlin, 3 billion marks from general economic growth and 3 billion marks from the phasing out of the tax breaks granted to West Berlin business before unification, when the West German government compensated companies for the disadvantage of their geographic and economic location in the middle of East Germany.
The loss of the tax breaks is proving to have a variety of effects, often depending on the type of business involved. Retailers, who have been flooded with new customers from Eastern Germany, and producers of consumer goods and foodstuffs, who have found it relatively easy to boost their sales in the newly accessible surrounding markets, will tend not to suffer.
But other companies, such as the pharmaceutical and chemical giant Schering AG, say profits are being hit despite an aggressive sales and marketing push into Central and Eastern Europe. “The structure of the economy in these countries and the lack of hard currency has complicated our plan to increase sales,” said Horst Kramp, a member of Schering’s executive board. “In the short term, we can’t compensate for our higher costs through increased sales so we must save wherever we can.”
Although Schering, the only major German company that currently has its headquarters in Berlin, does not plan to cut either jobs or investment, its rationalization program and comparable cost-cutting at other firms has had a ripple effect on the Berlin economy.
The owner of a small language school who expected business to improve thanks to increased demand from East Berliners keen to learn English has seen any such benefit canceled out as regular corporate customers have cut back on extras.
Small business has also been squeezed by the skyrocketing rates for office rental and the sharply higher costs of land.
ALTHOUGH there have been numerous calls for the government to control the rise of property and rental costs both for business and housing, Mr. Pieroth said Berliners must adapt to the prices, which are no higher than in other West German cities.
Despite the greater influence of market forces in both East and West Berlin’s economic life, neither business leaders or politicians envisage a day when the city will be able to do entirely without government support. Berlin will always need a certain amount of help to pay for its many expensive cultural and educational institutions. As a consequence of its history as a divided city, Berlin has separate museum systems, universities, national theater companies and opera houses. While some of the museum collections can be merged and a few of the smaller theaters privatized, Berlin believes that in its role as Germany’s capital, it is crucial to keep the rest.</span></div></div>

Is it 2019 yet? Last Thursday (1°F in Boston that morning—OK, no competition with Minnesota, but still) I attended a program given by Suffolk University Law School’s Intellectual Property section on the subject of the public domain. This was in celebration of the fact that, for the first time in 20 years, works have started to age out of copyright coverage. Thus, works first published in the US in 1923, including classics of literature, art, music and film, are now free for everyone to use. Or pretty much so.

Holy hypodermic, Batman! Since my exposure to the pharma industry is pretty tangential, I haven't been following this dispute between Fresenius, a large German drug company, and Akorn, a US company it had agreed to acquire and then sought to drop like ein' heißen Kartoffel. The Delaware Court of Chancery handed down its judgment in the case Monday in an opinion by Vice Chancellor Laster, and it's quite remarkable--the opinion, for all its 246 pages, is quite the page-turner and discloses a pretty sordid set of facts. You can find the case here (). The detailed description of the facts ...read more

An article published yesterday caught my eye in that it focused on a previously unremarked aspect of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action I have been following. It's worth mentioning here. A month or so ago the SEC brought a civil lawsuit against the founder of Mozido, a financial technology (fintech) company, alleging that he had fraudulently induced investors into putting money into companies he controlled, giving the investors to believe that they were investing in Mozido itself (Mozido is not a party to the SEC action). The factual settin ...read more

An awful lot of people believe that they can research their own legal needs online and find a free or dirt-cheap legal form that will protect them in documenting their transactions. They’re wrong. Yes, yes, I know, it’s in my interest to have clients in need of documentation for business transactions come to me (or, more benevolently, any transactional attorney skilled in drafting) to prepare them and not rely on forms they downloaded from the Interwebs. But really, it’s in their own interest not to rely on those forms, and I’ll tell you why: 1. A form doesn’t know you ...read more

A recent case in Pennsylvania has come to the refreshing, albeit to laymen blindingly obvious, conclusion that you can’t use bare grammatical or syntactic “rules” to avoid deciding what a contract means based on what the parties intended it to mean. In BL Partners Group, LP v. Interbroad LLC () (sadly not a precedental decision), a building owner leased a rooftop to BLP for a billboard. The lease, which had a 90-year term, included the following language in its termination provision: "In the event that Lessor's building is damaged by fire or other casualty and Lessor elects ...read more

There's been a flap in the news lately about the genealogy and DNA-testing site ancestry.com ("Ancestry"), which among other things offers to test users' DNA to ascertain their national and ethnic ancestry. Their terms of service, which (as they will remind you if ever you are in violation of them) constitutes the contract between them and the user, was found by one eagle-eyed privacy crusader () to contain a license from the user to Ancestry granting it a "perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license" to the user's DNA data.

Many times a start-up company will need services, for example software development, but doesn’t have the money to pay for them. At that point, many founders offer to give their key contributors “a piece of the action” by issuing equity in the company in exchange for the services. The services contributor might be willing to accept that bargain because the ultimate value of the equity stands to be much greater than the value of the time put in. Sounds like a win-win proposition. However, there are numerous factors to consider before agreeing to such a deal, on both sides of the equ ...read more

"You're over-lawyering it!" is one of the most common complaints leveled by a client's representative at a transactional attorney. What usually precipitates the comment is when the lawyer returns an agreement drafted by the client's counter-party and the lawyer has lavishly decorated it with comments and edits. It can be quite dismaying to see such a document; it means that the negotiating road ahead may be steep and rocky, with the date of signature not right around the corner, and a very real possibility that there won't be one at all if it turns out there are fundamental impediments ...read more</span></div></div>

1. Make Sure Customer Service Reps Understand What They’re Talking About
It’s vital that the call center staff have more than a passing familiarity with the products or services a client offers. This helps call center representatives to answer questions about those items more accurately and thoroughly when they come up. Having this background knowledge and access to FAQs will make it easier for them to emphasize with concerned customers and find rapport when they call. Plus, it gives the agent the ability to solve the problem on their own.. Understanding more about your business helps improve the overall experience for the customer and the agent.
2. Create Templatized Responses for Popular Questions
Some call centers offer scripts of basic phrases or responses but this approach can sometimes be limiting and may even have a negative outcome. It’s certainly easy to follow along until something changes, such as a customer asking or saying something unexpected. Rather than confusing the agent or forcing them to pause and regroup, a template of common topics and responses might be more useful. Instead of forcing the representative not to veer from what is stated on the particular script, they can instead learn the frequently asked questions and common solutions. This also allows them to show more creativity and initiative in adapting the conversation as needed.
3. Consider an Automated Answering Service
A goal of most call centers – and most callers – is to connect with a human when possible, since most problems need further explanation and context to try and solve. You can streamline your customer service, improve your efficiency and ensure your customers get connected with the right person by utilizing an automated answering service. An automated answering service can help callers reach the right point of contact by creating a phone tree for your company. That way, when they do connect to a live agent, they are speaking with the appropriate person, and they can jump right into finding a solution. This helps overall efficiency in terms of less time spent with each caller. It also makes sure customers are sent to the right group instead of being transferred time and time again until being connected to the right department. This strategy streamlines your customer service efforts by helping the agent be more prepared to interact with a customer. An automated answering service can also provide more than just a phone tree solution; they can send out appointment reminders, announcements, and surveys too.
Interestingly, an automated answering service combined with a live answering service can dramatically improve your customer service efficiency.
4. Try a Virtual Answering Service
A virtual answering service puts the “human” interaction right at the front line/initial point of contact. This type of service can be used for busy places that have a high call volume and need help answering callers’ questions, or for a company that wants every caller to be initially greeted by a friendly voice and then transferred to the appropriate contact. Using a virtual answering service can also make sense financially. Rather than hiring several receptionists or other administrative staff to handle all the calls, a customer call center can handle the load. Every employee on this team will be trained in proper greetings and common questions, and it will be so seamless that callers won’t be able to tell that the person greeting them and directing their call isn’t actually in the same building, or even the same state. This option can save your organization a good deal of time and money.
The previous four solutions barely scratch the service of ways that a customer call center such as AnswerNow can aid your business. Utilizing the service of a regularly trained team which specializes in customer service and helping to take care of customer concerns as efficiently as possible is definitely a win-win for your organization.
What makes an AnswerNow team special? In addition to high standards of quality, our organization also focuses on other attributes, such as making sure to fulfill any promises given or made, and getting back to someone with answers as quickly as possible.

But when the time comes to let go, it can also be wrenching.
Once you’ve become attached to a sweet dog, it can bedifficult bordering onimpossible to say goodbye. Many people, recognizing their limitations, have told me flat-out that they couldn’t possibly foster because they quickly form a bond and cannot let go.
This is why so manyanimal rescuersbecome “foster failures” – i.e. they wind up adopting a dog they initially planned to house on a temporary basis. How do you say farewell to a creature you’ve fed and played with, medicated and cuddled? As one rescuer I know memorably said, “Failure never felt so good.”
But that doesn’t mean foster success feels less good.It feels great – and it frees up room in your home and heart for the next needy K9. But before you can experience the joy of foster success, first you -the foster caregiver – mustfacesome serious separation anxiety.And that ain’t easy.
As foster caregivers, we strive to do what’s in the best interest of the dog in question. And in the case of my beloved Lady Bug,the right thing to do was let go. So that’s what I did yesterday: Ientrusted herto an excellentrescue group that already has a beautiful permanent home lined up and waiting for the perfect Chihuahua.
Which is precisely what Bug is. I’ll never forget how calm she remained when the ceiling in my apartment fell in. Or how perfectly housetrained she is. Or her adorablehabit of jumping into my lap.
I’m a big-dog person, and I’m a sucker for aK9 in need. That explains how I came to have 6 large dogs,each of them clamoring for my attention 24/7. My mother never fails to let me know that each one of my dogs wants to the the only dog. She always delivers this line with a disapprovingshake of her head, as if I’m subjecting the members of my pack to the worst kind of emotional torture imaginable.
Perhapsshe is right – unfortunately, like most Moms, she’s almost always right.
In my defense, I’ll say what I always tell my Mom: That mybig dogs enjoy each other’s company enormously. But Bug is a different story. Let’s just say she’s not a dog person; she’s a people person. She loves getting attention from members of the human species, and returns that attention a hundredfold. She fits my mother’s profile of a dog who wants to be an only child.Bug wanted me all to herself. And sadly, what with my prior commitment to my family of big dogs, this is not something Iwas able togive her.
I can, however, do my utmost to see to it that Bug gets exactly what she wants out of life:A wonderful, caring home in which she and her amazing, gravity-defyingears arethe radiant center of attention.
As we waited on my stoop for the car to come and pick her up, Bug nestled sweetly in my lap. I buried my face in her neck; she gave me passionate French-Mexican kisses, slipping her tongue into my mouth. It was always difficult to photograph her because she’s a constantly moving target, wiggling at high speeds andmoving her head from side to side to take in every detail of her surroundings.
This time, however, I was able to get some amazingly pensive shots of my little girl – that’s how relaxed she was. The most casual observer would’ve had a hard time not noticing how very attached to each other we’d become, my Love Bug and I.
Thenher rideappeared.
I handedBug over to the driver, then ran inside to get her paperwork, postponing the inevitable for just a few minutes more. As I came back down the steps of my building, I nearly called the whole thing off when I sawBug sittingin the driver’s lap with her ears perked up, watching and waiting for me with laserlike focus.Her worried expressionnearly broke my heart! She clearly expected me tojoin herin the vehicle. But I maintained my resolve, handed over the papers, kissed her twomore times- then turned around andwent back inside.
I’ll give you the Bug update as soon as I have it. It’s hard to believe a creature weighing just 9 pounds could leave my heart so heavy by her absence. That littledog will be missed in no small way.

MPs are to receive taxpayer-funded iPads in an attempt to modernise Parliament.One of the things most people in industry notice is that any cost saving or paper saving equipment usually costs a lot and generates more paperwork. There's also the problem that iPads are not exactly suitable office style equipment, the big advantage of a laptop is the keyboard, the onscreen keyboard the iPad uses is nowhere near as fast or as useful, so as a research tool it's less than satisfactory. Battery life is limited, doesn't support flash (no kidding) and can’t make phone calls, can’t take pictures, and the most affordable model only has WiFi.
Politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return.
Around 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade.
Buying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move.
But the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper.
There’s also no multitasking in the iPad because it uses some variant of the iPhone OS. This means you can’t listen to Spotify and browse the web at the same time. No working in Pages while making a VoIP call. And the list goes on…
And because of the closed nature of all things Apple, there’s no simple way to transfer files to and from the iPad. Why is this relevant? Well, it means all the media files will have to be synced through iTunes, which always involves conversions to the mad Apple formats. There’s no way to just drag and drop them over WiFi or using a USB Mass Storage Device.
Not to mention all the documents produced with iWork (which even deserved to be ported to the iPad). Where will those go? And while we’re in this department, how can a device coined as a “great productivity tool” lack the support for non-Apple office software (Microsoft and Openoffice).
The main problem though is that the most affordable model is very, very expensive compared to say a netbook and the money for it is coming out of our pockets, not the House of Commons or the MP's.
Essentially it's a massive waste of money to give MP's a "cool" iPad on the taxpayers expense, it wont improve productivity and it wont save paper as MP's wont be able to use it for the purposes it's supposedly to be used for.
They'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop.

"They'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop" ...
They don't even need those, all MP's have advisers, researchers, interns etc crawling out their arseholes .. they all have mobile phones, which are no doubt being paid for by us .. they should be using those for back-channel info &amp; comms ..
The country is in shit-order, small businesses are going to the wall, law &amp; order is getting out of hand, immigration has already got out of hand &amp; these cretins are poncing around with iPads ..
This is nothing more nor less than self-indulgent people, indulging themselves yet again, at our expence, because they can ..
Its been said before but will stand repetition ..

While he’s originally from Poland and now lives in London, Thomas is fascinated with the Middle East and its love of scent. His latest range, the Signature Collection, which is inspired by our region, features four fragrances that use ingredients such as oud, rose, amber and violet. He tells Friday how he built a career in fragrance and his secrets to wearing scents.
When did your love for fragrance begin?
It started when I was working in London with aromatherapy oils. I began to realise how important the smell of things are and it made me want to look further into it. This led me to begin my career in fragrance.
Where did your inspiration come for your Signature Collection?
The collection is inspired by the Middle East but the combination of ingredients was chosen to send the customer on a journey. Each ingredient is in its purest form so the scent will last longer.
Your factory is based in France – do you source a lot of your ingredients there or does it depend on the brief?
My ingredients are of the best quality and are sourced from all over the world, however they are processed at my factory in France. It’s a magical process when we bring all these ingredients together in there.
Are there any particular scents you think work well together?
I would never say there are any ingredients that don’t work together. Never say never, and try everything. I do love to smell powdery and musky scents together.
How important is the way someone smells?
It is more important than people would ever realise. The way someone smells is often the first thing you’ll notice about them and the thing you will remember for the longest after you have met them.
Where is the best part of the body to apply fragrance?
Firstly this depends on the person’s own taste, and secondly where they are or what they are doing that day. If you were at work or on a long flight, for example, and wanted something subtle you would apply scent to your wrists, but if you wanted something stronger you would apply fragrance to your chest and neck area.
Are there different rules to wearing scent for men and women?
The rules are the same. All my fragrances are unisex and can smell very different on men and women as they adapt to the person.
Which celebrity would you like to create a scent for, and what would it be like?
I would love to create a fragrance for female tennis stars. It would be fresh and something light that they could wear while playing. I have always been a huge tennis fan and play myself, so combining my two passions is something that really interests me.
How do you make a fragrance last all day?
Use a fragrance that has only the purest ingredients. This might be expensive but I believe it is worth it. Cheaper fragrances often use diluted ingredients, meaning the smell wears off much quicker.
Can you give us your dos and don’ts for wearing fragrance?
- Don’t be afraid to experiment with scents you wouldn’t usually wear – you’ll be surprised by the effect it has on the people around you.
- Don’t apply fragrance to your skin, apply it to your clothes – it will last longer.
- Do remember that scent can work in [two] ways. While it can be beautiful, it can also be overpowering, so remember where you are.
- Do layer more than one fragrance on your body to create a unique smell.

Most of us know from experience that tossing and turning at night means feeling rotten the next day. And many of us understand that there are long-term health consequences when we’re short-changed on sleep.
But recently I found out something new from a fascinating study on sleep and its effect on how fast postmenopausal women’s genes age – which is known as their “epigenetic age.”
In the study, postmenopausal women with 5 insomnia symptoms were nearly 2 years older biologically than similar women with no insomnia symptoms. The more insomnia symptoms — waking up at night, not being able to fall back asleep, disturbed sleep and so on — the greater the effect. If you’re sleeping only 6 hours a night, however, it doesn’t seem to increase your epigenetic age — so long as it’s restful sleep. And that, of course, is where a lot of us have trouble.
So what can we do about all this? I like to point out that the research shows that our genes are not entirely out of our control, and we can influence how they respond by taking better care of ourselves. For those of us who are done with menopause and may be having trouble sleeping, this means looking at ways we can improve our rest.
4 sleep tips to try
- Keep a regular schedule. Your brain likes consistency, so go to bed by 11 and at the same regular hour each night and in a dark room.
- Turn off the electronics! Computers, TVs, phones — they all are the enemy of sleep. Even a short duration of light shining in your eyes fools your brain into thinking it’s time to wake up. Shut down at least an hour before bedtime every night without fail, and put your phone on its charger in another room so you’re not tempted to look at it if you can’t sleep.
- Eat early and moderately. Heavy meals too close to bedtime disrupt sleep, while avoiding caffeine and stimulations (like dramatic/stressful TV shows)
- Keep relaxing once in bed. Once in bed, consider practicing relaxing abdominal breathing or guided visualizations like those of Yoga Nidra.
You can see more of my favorite sleep remedies in the checklist to the right, including adrenal-supporting Serinisol from Women’s Health Network.

The idea? The words? The piece of paper? What if

what if someone stole the box? Would the contents be yours by rule of

Now you're sharing information. How can information be solely
*yours* if you give it to someone else - does that not instantly give them
every bit as much power as you (depending upon their resources to act on it)?
>If I write something specifically for you and give it to you, does
>that give you some ownership of it?
How can one own a piece of a bit of information? Does not having
information instantly make you the entire owner, even if others have the
same information (hence, each of you *own* 100% of the information)?
By whose rules do you come up with these solutions? I'm not trying
to create circular arguments, i'm trying to show that ownership, especially
when applied to information, is a bogus concept once it's removed from the
laws of a society. In America, ownership rests with whoever registered it
with the government. But the very fact that our society sees this as a
necessary step proves that ownership in nature is a random and transient
property, even if it exists at all. Come to think of it, who created
ownership - Man or God? So in situations where there are no societal laws
to tell us what to do, (such as who "owns" the information in an email),
you have only one thing to rely on: TRUS_ (fill in the blank), which IMHO,
is as random and transient within the boundaries of laws as ownership is
without (the boundaries of laws).

Parting shots - some interesting quotes on ownership:
"The moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as
sacred as the laws of God...anarchy and tyranny commence."
- John Adams
"In every society where property exists, there will ever be a struggle
between rich and poor. Mixed in one assembly, equal laws can never be
expected; they will either be made by the members to plunder the few who
are rich, or by the influential to fleece the many who are poor."
- John Adams
(Looking at both those quotes - from the same man - would lead one to
believe that the plundering of the rich and the fleecing of the poor are as
sacred as the laws of God)
"The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property."
- John Locke
(I would say preservation of life came first, then preservation of propety
a lucky(?) bi-product. Is life property? Discuss.)
"Property is theft."
- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
(It's a given that you can't have theft without property. Is the converse
true? Somebody whip out the symbolic logic tables on this one.)
"By abolishing private property one deprives the human love of aggression."
- Sigmund Freud
"When Marx spoke of private property he was not referring to personal
property. Private property meant the means of production of the capitalist
who hires property-less individuals under conditions the latter is forced
to accept."
- Erich Fromm
"The preservation of the rights of private property was the very keystone
of the arch upon which all civilized governments rest."
- Joseph Choate
(Civilized governments??? History shows clearly that the less emphasis a
society had on private property, the more *civilized* it was. (READ:
Tibet, Pre-colonial America). The unfortunate corrollary is that your
neighbors, who do care a great deal for private property, don't give two
shits about what you think (READ: Tibet, Pre-colonial Americ to President Franklin
Pierce1852
(Does this sound familiar, Dirk Gently?)
"It is the preoccupation with possession, more than anything else, that
prevents men from living freely and nobly."
- Bertrand Russell
(tidbit: the original phrase was not "life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness," but "life, liberty, and the pursuit of property." Was it
changed at the realization that the latter two are opposites?)
Sorry for rambling.

The food is ok, but it is way too expensive for what it is. Not worth the price, in my opinion. Dinner Bell has the same type of food at a much better price.
great steak and drinks on a hilltop. relaxing experience rustic yet elegantly appointed. have been here several times. a little slow but you better expect that when eating out in the PK area. Best place on PK lake to eat out aside from your own camp fire!
Excellent service, personable staff and terrific meals. As well as unbelievably breathtaking views of the Texas countryside.
Price is a little high but you get what you pay for. Very nice place to eat beautiful view. Great service. Great drinks. Brought mom here for her birthday. A group of 10 adults had drinks. No ones drink ever ran empty. even the kids loved it.
One of the operators of restaurant is sensitive to Msg so they removed it from seasoning salt-- Great group of ladies run this!
Second time to go in 2 weeks. Yeah its that good! My steak was perfect both in doneness and seasoning. Tge Whiskey bread pudding is nearly worth my 140 mile drive alone. Jack &amp; Cokes were made just right. And you cannot beat the view! After our meal we sat outside on the patio snd enjoyed a few beverages, the...

We ate here while staying at the Wildcatter Ranch in September 2014. The food and service were both enjoyable, i enjoyed a very filling and well cooked steak with bourbon glazed carrots and a loaded baked potato. It is enough to keep you going for a few days.
The only criticisms i would have is that the last seating is...

The Tottenham manager spoke to Onda Cero's El Transistor programme about life in London and Guardiola's problematic remarks about SpursChelsea - Barcelona U - 19 live: UEFA Youth League final
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino spent a short while chatting to Onda Cero radio programme El Transistor last night. The Argentine coach spoke about a number of topics including adapting to life in London, the rivalry between Barcelona and Espanyol, his feelings on Guardiola's broadside about Spurs and taking tips from Carles Puyol and Sergio Ramos.
LaLiga: "Despite having spent the past few years in England, I still actively follow what's going on in Spain and the Spanish league. Last night I went to bed worried about what has been happening in Galicia and Asturias with the forest fires. And unfortunately, I am also following everything that's going on in Catalunya. I am an open-minded person who finds it hard to put up frontiers and barriers - especially as both of my sons were born in Barcelona and are diehard Espanyol fans".
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino getting some ball practice in at the Bernabéu yesterday JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Pochettino, true to his values because I would feel like a traitor to myself. You have to remain true to yourself and respect your own values".
Differences between Barça and Espanyol: "The values of both clubs are completely different - that's not to say that one's club's values are better than the other's - it's just that they are different".
JESUS RUBIO (DIARIO AS)
Challenges of living abroad
Life in England: "I Spain I felt very much at home. It's similar to Argentina and that's why it's nice for me to come back after being away for five years. I went to England without knowing a single word of English and now I can defend myself quite well in the language but for a year and a half I was unable to give interviews other than in Spanish".
War of words with Guardiola: "It was a lack of respect on his behalf and maybe I should have responded to it but I'll continue having the same admiration I've always had for him".
JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Spurs idol, Kane
Harry Kane: "Kane is worshipped at Tottenham and I hope that with Spurs he can have the kind of career Totti enjoyed with Roma. He's a very mature, level-headed person and domestically and personally he has the right structure in place for him to become a great player".
Sergio Ramos as a role model: "Sergio Ramos has quality and leadership. When I was coaching Espanyol I would tell the younger defenders like Víctor Ruiz and Jordi Amat to go to Camp Nou to watch how Puyol times a challenge. Now I tell our young centre-back to watch Sergio Ramos".
Future at Real Madrid? "I am completely focused on my project with Tottenham because at the end of the day, it's the results which will determine your sell-by date".

The iPad 2 has hit eBay and is already demanding crazy prices. The new tablet hit US shops on Friday, with profit-minded moneygrubbers and early adopters looking to cash in and show off.
Getting one's toes stubbed in the packed halls is a small price to pay when coming across bizarre offerings like an updated version of the Muse2 MP5 player.
Though this isn't the official untethered jailbreaking solution for iOS 4.2.1, the iPhone Dev Team has produced a short demo video showing off a workaround method for getting it done now.

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h4>
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to consult an external authoritative knowledge base before generating responses. This approach significantly boosts the models' ability to produce relevant, accurate, and context-specific output by extending their capabilities to specialized domains or an organization's internal data, without the need for retraining. RAG offers a cost-effective method to leverage the vast data processing power of LLMs, equipped with billions of parameters, for tasks such as question-answering, language translation, and sentence completion, ensuring that the output is always up-to-date and applicable to various contexts.</p>
<p>RAG's importance lies in its potential to address the inherent challenges of LLMs, such as unpredictability in responses, reliance on static and potentially outdated training data, and the risk of disseminating incorrect or non-authoritative information. These issues can negatively affect user trust in AI-powered applications, making RAG's ability to guide LLMs toward authoritative sources for information retrieval invaluable.</p>
<p>RAG has multiple benefits, including cost-effective implementation and maintenance, access to current information, improved user trust through accurate information and source attribution, and greater control for developers over the information retrieval process. This approach allows for the dynamic updating of LLMs with the latest research, statistics, or news, directly addressing the challenges of maintaining relevancy and accuracy in rapidly changing knowledge landscapes. Additionally, it empowers organizations to deploy generative AI more confidently across a wider range of applications, enhancing both the user experience and the reliability of AI-driven interactions.</p>
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Dataset 12000 dataset is a triple-feature collection, with each entry containing a "context", "question", and "answer" fields, designed to help build RAG-optimized models. This data consists of 12000 entries, and the context data is from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb">Falcon RefinedWeb</a>.</p>
