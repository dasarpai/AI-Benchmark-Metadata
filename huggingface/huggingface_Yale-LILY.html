again correctly (your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.\nTransaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).\nWe appreciate your patience and continued

understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions.\nThe problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message \&quot;You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\&quot;\nThis is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).\nShould you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.\nIf you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).\nPlease try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.\n3)  If you see this error message \&quot;Invalid login; please try again\&quot; (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.\nYour account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate).\nWe are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening.\nOnce we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).\nAlways remember that your password is case sensitive.\nShould you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night).\nWe will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then information will be as of Monday (11/19/01).\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.\nSincerely,\n&quot;},&quot;subject_line&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Internet

(IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails).\nWe really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.\nWe knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).\nThis process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.\nAfter verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.\nSome of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen.\nShould this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days).\nThis has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS

there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.\nA single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.\nAt the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.\nAdditionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\nWe have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.\nThese are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).\nPlease see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.\nWe have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.\nThe two key points from this data are as follows:   1.\nThe high physical prices on the 26th &amp; 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.\n2.\nThe spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &amp;  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.\nIt doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.\nI understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.\nHopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.\nI wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.\nIt is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.\nIt is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.\nPlease contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.\nSincerely,\n&quot;},&quot;subject_line&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;San Juan

LLC and President &amp; CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.\nThe purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.\nThe meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.\nI will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.\nI realize there are significant issues to be addressed.\nRefco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors &amp; locals down to individuals.\nWe have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.\nPhase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.\nIf this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.\nThe idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.\nMark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.\nRefco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.\nSo, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.\nCredit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.\nRegards\n&quot;},&quot;subject_line&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;REFCO Project

time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.\nFor those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).\nA blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a \&quot;peoples choice\&quot; (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).\nEvery year, my wife asks the following: \t\&quot;So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?\&quot;\nI reply:\t\&quot;Nothing comes to mind.\&quot;\nShe replies:\t\&quot;No.\&quot;\nAs you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.\nSo, appetizers, sides, desserts and food &amp; drink for the kids are also served.\nThe competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.\nThe appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.\nThere are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing \&quot;personal reasons\&quot;  Date &amp; Time Saturday November 3rd.\nWe fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.\nWhere 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.\nThe first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.\nTake this exit and go through the

tell he was embarrassed.\nI guess there are some things in life you just never live down.\nI also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.\nWe shared a cab to the airport and realized we

this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.\nPlease do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.\nAdditionally, we need to get quotes from as

I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.
Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.
Additionally, it is getting close to closing.
I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible.
We can handle this in two ways.
I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).
I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00.
I look forward to hearing from you.

One major change is the wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and not descriptions).
You can change your account descriptions by clicking on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.
We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly (your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.
Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).
We appreciate your patience and continued support.
Our goal is to be fully operational and all information corrected before the holiday season.
Please make sure to record any suggestions (or problems) that you might have concerning our web site.

The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.
3)  If you see this error message "Invalid login; please try again" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.
Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate).
We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening.
Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).
Always remember that your password is case sensitive.
Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night).
We will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then information will be as of Monday (11/19/01).
Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.
Sincerely,
</span></div></div>

I want to take a few minutes to summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.
1.
Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you gave us and move forward with this approach.
2.
SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for sign-off on each topic.
3.
Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target.
We will meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've designed them so far and arrive at a solution.
(I will send an e-mail Monday with the room number.)
Have a good weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen.
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days).
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information.
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November &amp; December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again.
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:

A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.
These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.
The high physical prices on the 26th &amp; 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.
2.
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &amp;  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
Sincerely,
</span></div></div>

We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.
Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.
They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.
They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.
To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.
Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.
Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.
The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.
Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.
Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.
Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.
All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.
Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President &amp; CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.
The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.
The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.
I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.
I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.
Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors &amp; locals down to individuals.
We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.
Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.
If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.
The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.
Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.
Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.
So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.
Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.
Regards

This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).
I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.
For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).
A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).
Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"
I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."
She replies:	"No."
As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.
So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food &amp; drink for the kids are also served.
The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.
The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.
There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing "personal reasons"  Date &amp; Time Saturday November 3rd.
We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.
The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.
Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April.
Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building.
Right before that building is Elm Street.
Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street.
Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS Bring 'em!
We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.
The more kids the better.
What you need to bring Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

How are you??
I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently.
I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.
I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story.
Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead?
John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.
When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.
So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.
Poor thing says "yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments..."  I could tell he was embarrassed.
I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.
I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.
We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time.
I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well.
They immediately said "John Arnold!"
Shocked the hell out of me, honestly.
They were very funny in saying that I had made a "bad trade" by marrying my husband instead of you.
I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.
Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.
Please drop me a line when you aren't trading up a storm...
Warm regards,
</span></div></div>

Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.
It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:  1.
Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)
2.
Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)
In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.
I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.
We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.
We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.
Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.
However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.
Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.
Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.
Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.
If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the "war room" next to Louise's office.
If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.

There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.
However, in the previous  methodology they blew out.
For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256.
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time.
The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year.
These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475.
In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them

It was a pleasure to talk to you yesterday.I had discussed with  you our programme for the return journey.Though our return journey is fixed  on 18th of Nov. but due to circumstances as discussed with you yesterday ,we  may have to extend our stay for a couple of months if we could get clearance  from INS for which AP has applied.
In the meantime ,if we could have an  understanding with Dimpy/Ap we may move earlier as planned.
Any case we must  keep more medicines so that at that time we may not have any problem.
I  therefore  will greatly appreciate if you can arrange to get the following  medicines from India with Raj's mother who is coming  in the next month and  then later on these can be sent to us.

FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call  @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins.
I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.
The good news is --- this pricing generated some interest.

Here are the opportunities:  1.
GridSouth - (They really want to dump in "CP&amp;L East" - anything we can do to facilitate 	this will better meet customer requirements.
Capacity:	2003 - 100MW 				2004 - 250MW 				2005 - 570MW for five years  	Will accept day-ahead dispatch.
Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability.
Heat Rate:	7200 		VOM		$2/MWh  2.
Entergy -   		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.
Capacity:	65MW 		Start Date:	July 2002 		Term:		5 Years 		Price:		$x/MWh  3.
TVA - Peaker  		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.
Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
Start Date:	June 2004 		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar 		Heat Rate:	10,900 		VOM:		$2/MWh  		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.
If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.
If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.
4.
TVA - Combined Cycle  		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.
This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.
Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.
Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.
Thanks for all your work.
I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.
Regards, Greg

They are "in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale.
I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us.
Unfortunately, NO.
To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date.
Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us.
Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive?
The heat rate call is struck at 10,900!

My interface at TVA emailed yesterday requesting a phone dialogue to discuss where our Synthetic Peaker offer needs to be for TVA to execute.
Holding all assumptions constant, we would need to come in between $2.25-$2.30/KW-month in order for TVA to execute.
Our indicative quote was $3.90/KW-month.
I will attempt to find out if they have other offers in the sub-$2.50 range or if they are just setting their own bid at the requested price.

In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.
I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:   ?
Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits ?
Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk ?
Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking  ?
Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States ?
Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid ?
Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM ?
Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility ?
Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products ?
Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy ?
Strength in mentoring junior traders   Thank you,
</span></div></div>

He had the following comments regarding the HR options you were hearing about in the market place:  	1.
They are not sure of their long term perspective.
Thus, they are focusing on structures that are three years and less.
2.
They are interested in June-September only 	 	3.
They are flexible on the size of the transaction (100-500 MW?)
4.
They want to buy a 10-11 HR and sell a 6-7 HR.
5.
They would like a financially settled transaction.
6.
They would love hourly (virtual peaker) but would settle for daily.
Please let me know your level of interest.
I would like to get something back to them just to start discussions.
In addition,  I am ready to give MidAmerican Energy some indicative numbers whenever you get them.
Thanks,

Rationale: The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of factors.
Most important, we believe, will be changes in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market movements.
Changes in CTD will change the amount of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of the TYZ/TYH roll's value.
For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5% 2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.
However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.
We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.
We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.
Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.

"No, sir, I don't drink," retorts the bum.
"You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are  you?"
asks the gentleman.
"No way, I don't gamble," answers the bum.
"You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens fees, would you?"
asks the man.
"Never," says the bum, "I don't play golf."
The man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him for a home cooked meal.
The bum accepts eagerly.
While they are heading for the man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him.
"Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?"
"Probably," says the man, "but it will be worth it.
I want  her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble  or play golf."

If you want to stay truly informed and get the facts about what's really happening in the world, I strongly suggest that you read The Washington Times National Weekly Edition.
I could not do without The Times to combat the liberalism of the Washington Post.
