results of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using hypericin (a new photosensitizer for PDD that helps to label flat urothelial tumours to facilitate biopsy) for the early detection of superficial bladder carcinoma, as flat noninvasive tumours of the bladder may be missed during conventional white-light cystoscopy (WLC) if there is bladder overdistension or ongoing cystitis. Between 1 January 2001 and 30 October 2004, 41 consecutive patients (mean age 66.1 years, sd 9.1, range 46-81) had transurethral resection for bladder cancer. Hypericin was introduced intravesically for 2 h before cystoscopy. Immediately after WLC, fluorescence cystoscopy (FC) was used at the same location and the same bladder site inspected using violet light. FC findings, e.g. positive or negative red fluorescence, were documented for each specific bladder site examined, and the exact location sampled for biopsy. The mean (sd, range) bladder capacity of the patients was 431 (86, 300-650) mL. In all, 179 biopsies were taken from the 41 patients; urothelial cancers were found in 41% (74) and 80% (33) had macroscopically visible bladder tumours; 40% (71) of the biopsies were positive under FC and 86% (61) of the 71 FC-positive biopsies showed cancer on histology. Twenty-five biopsies (14%) were positive on FC but not WLC. PDD testing with hypericin had a sensitivity of 82% (61/74) and specificity of 91% (95/105), vs WLC, at 62% (46/74) and 98% (103/105), respectively. The PDD test had a positive predictive value of 86% (61/71) and a negative predictive value of 88% (95/108), vs 96% (46/48) and 79% (103/131), respectively for WLC. There were no reports of significant complications after the procedure.&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;Is photodynamic diagnosis using hypericin better than white-light cystoscopy for detecting superficial bladder carcinoma?<||||>To review the initial clinical results of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using hypericin (a new photosensitizer for PDD that helps to label flat urothelial tumours to facilitate biopsy) for the early detection of superficial bladder carcinoma, as flat noninvasive tumours of the bladder may be missed during conventional white-light cystoscopy (WLC) if there is bladder overdistension or ongoing cystitis.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of infants who received epidural infusions containing bupivacaine 0.1% (n = 18) and bupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 2 to 5 microg/mL (n = 10) after CCAM resection during a 12-month period. LOS, rescue opioid, and nonopioid analgesic use, incidence of respiratory depression, and pain scores were recorded. The LOS in patients receiving fentanyl in their epidural solution was 1 day longer than those receiving plain bupivacaine (median 4 vs 3 days, respectively). Nonopioid analgesic and rescue opioid use was greater in patients who did not have fentanyl in their epidural solutions. Pain ratings were not significantly different.

We hypothesized that males with PFP would move with greater varus knee mechanics compared with male controls and compared with females with PFP. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that males with PFP would demonstrate greater varus alignment. A gait and single-leg squat analysis was conducted on each group (18 runners per group). Measurement of each runner's tibial mechanical axis was also recorded. Motion data were processed using Visual 3D (C-Motion, Bethesda, MD). ANOVAs were used to analyze the data. Males with PFP ran and squatted in greater peak knee adduction and demonstrated greater peak knee external adduction moment compared with healthy male controls. In addition, males with PFP ran and squatted with less peak hip adduction and greater peak knee adduction compared with females with PFP. The static measure of mechanical axis of the tibial was not different between groups.

Our goal was to predict the outcome of the trial by comparing results of small AAA repair using EVAR vs OR at a tertiary institution. Using selection criteria of PIVOTAL trial, we reviewed clinical data of 194 consecutive patients, who underwent EVAR or OR for 4.0-5.0 cm AAAs between 1997 and 2004. All-cause and aneurysm-related deaths, complications, reinterventions, ruptures, and conversions were documented; factors affecting outcome were analyzed using chi(2) tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic regression Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (range, 1 month to 9 years). A total of 194 patients, 162 males, 32 females (mean age: 71 years, range, 46-86) underwent 162 OR and 32 EVAR. EVAR patients were older (mean 74 +/- 6 vs 71 +/- 7, P = .002), had lower ejection fraction (mean 54 +/- 11 vs 61 +/- 13, P = .0002), and less likely to have ever smoked (69% vs 85%, P = .03) than OR patients. Thirty-day mortality was 1.3% (2/162) for OR and 0% for EVAR (0/33) (P = not significant [NS]). There were 49 systemic complications (7 EVAR, 42 OR, P = NS) and 10 local complications (3 EVAR, 7 OR, P = NS). During follow-up, there were no conversions and no ruptures. Freedom from reinterventions at 5 years was 83.1% +/- 6.9% for EVAR and 95.3% +/- 1.8% for OR (P = 0.02). There were 26 deaths (3 EVAR, 23 OR); but no procedure or aneurysm-related death was confirmed after 30 days (cause unknown in 16 deaths, 62%).

Each study randomized subjects to 4- to 6-month supervised aerobic exercise programs or to a control group of no supervised exercise training. For each of the 4 CV biomarkers, we calculated the respective proportions of control and exercise group subjects whose baseline-to-follow-up changes were greater than or equal to previously reported adverse change (AC) thresholds. Those thresholds were increases of 24 pmol · L(-1) or greater for FI, 0.42 mmol · L(-1) or greater for TG, 10 mm Hg or greater for SBP, and a decrease of 0.12 mmol · L(-1) or greater for HDL-C. The respective proportions of subjects meeting the AC threshold in the control and exercise groups were 15.2% versus 9.6% (P = 0.02) for FI, 14.9% versus 13.1% (P = 0.37) for TG, 16.9% versus 15.8% (P = 0.52) for SBP, and 28.6% versus 22.5% (P = 0.03) for HDL-C.

Herein, we report a prospective evaluation of the impact of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on outcome in non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We studied 144 patients (99 men; age 62±14 years) with stage 3-4 CKD, with baseline assessment of left ventricular mass index (LVMi) by echocardiography, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by MDRD equation, 24-h blood pressure profile and 24-h proteinuria. Combined end point was progression to ESRD requiring dialysis, or death within 5 years. Forty-nine patients (34%) progressed to dialysis, 24 (17%) died, 57 (39%) were dialysis-free after 5 years and 14 were lost to follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that increased LVMi (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17-1.40 for each 10-g/m2 increase, P<0.0001) and reduced eGFR (5% risk increase for each 1-mL/min reduction, P=0.027) were the significant predictors of the combined end point in stage 3 CKD patients, whereas LVMi proved to be the only significant predictor of the combined end point in patients with stage 4 CKD (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.31, P<0.0001). The same analysis showed that LVMi was the only significant predictor of progression to dialysis in stage 3 CKD patients (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.23-1.64 for each 10-g/m2 increase, P<0.0001), while a 20% increase in the risk of progression to ESRD was observed for each 10-g/m2 increase in LVMi (P<0.0001), and a 10% increase for each 1-mL/min reduction in eGFR (P=0.046) in patients with stage 4 CKD.

The main measure was reliability, which was assessed by two indicators: intra-instrument error for each of the two scales, and inter-instrument error. The second study was a descriptive study designed to test providers' perceptions of acceptability of Uniscale measurements. In the first study, a total of 458 subjects participated in the study. Overall, mean values of repeated measurements using each of the scales (intra-instrument error) were not significantly different.

  "Is photodynamic diagnosis using hypericin better than white-light cystoscopy for detecting superficial bladder carcinoma?&lt;||||>To review the initial clinical results of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using hypericin (a new photosensitizer for PDD that helps to label flat urothelial tumours to facilitate biopsy) for the early detection of superficial bladder carcinoma, as flat noninvasive tumours of the bladder may be missed during conventional white-light cystoscopy (WLC) if there is bladder overdistension or ongoing cystitis. Between 1 January 2001 and 30 October 2004, 41 consecutive patients (mean age 66.1 years, sd 9.1, range 46-81) had transurethral resection for bladder cancer. Hypericin was introduced intravesically for 2 h before cystoscopy. Immediately after WLC, fluorescence cystoscopy (FC) was used at the same location and the same bladder site inspected using violet light. FC findings, e.g. positive or negative red fluorescence, were documented for each specific bladder site examined, and the exact location sampled for biopsy. The mean (sd, range) bladder capacity of the patients was 431 (86, 300-650) mL. In all, 179 biopsies were taken from the 41 patients; urothelial cancers were found in 41% (74) and 80% (33) had macroscopically visible bladder tumours; 40% (71) of the biopsies were positive under FC and 86% (61) of the 71 FC-positive biopsies showed cancer on histology. Twenty-five biopsies (14%) were positive on FC but not WLC. PDD testing with hypericin had a sensitivity of 82% (61/74) and specificity of 91% (95/105), vs WLC, at 62% (46/74) and 98% (103/105), respectively. The PDD test had a positive predictive value of 86% (61/71) and a negative predictive value of 88% (95/108), vs 96% (46/48) and 79% (103/131), respectively for WLC.

  "Is an increased intestinal permeability a valid predictor of relapse in Crohn disease?&lt;||||>An increased intestinal permeability (IP) may be a pathogenetic factor in Crohn disease (CD). Increases in IP could be an indicator of subclinical disease and precede clinical relapses. We examined whether an increased IP is a valid predictor of relapse in CD. 27 patients with CD in remission (CDAI&lt;150) and 22 healthy controls ingested 3.7 MBq of 51Cr-EDTA, 20 kBq of 14C-mannitol and 5 g of unlabelled mannitol in 100 ml of distilled water. The percent urine excretion (24 h) of labelled markers was determined. Patients were followed for 1 year or until relapse, defined as CDAI>150 and>50 from baseline. Median (25th-75th percentiles). The excretion of 51Cr-EDTA was 1.55% (1.13%-2.53%) for patients and 1.20% (1.11%-1.44%) for controls (P = 0.04). Three of 9 patients with a raised, and 6 of 18 patients with a normal, 51Cr-EDTA excretion relapsed (P = 1.00; Fisher's exact test). Thus, the specificity and sensitivity of the 51Cr-EDTA test as a predictor of relapse was 67% and 33%, respectively. The 51Cr-EDTA/14C-mannitol index was 0.060 (0.037-0.093) for patients and 0.045 (0.038-0.054) for controls (P = 0.06). Four of 12 patients with a raised, and 5 of 15 patients with a normal, index relapsed (P = 1.00; Fisher's exact test).

Sixty-six patients suffering from cancer in a palliative phase were interviewed about their perspectives of euthanasia in relation to autonomy. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis with no predetermined categories. The informants expressed different positions on euthanasia, ranging from support to opposition, but the majority were undecided due to the complexity of the problem. The informants' perspectives on euthanasia in relation to autonomy focused on decision making, being affected by (1) power and (2) trust. Legalization of euthanasia was perceived as either (a) increasing patient autonomy by patient empowerment, or (b) decreasing patient autonomy by increasing the medical power of the health care staff, which could be frightening.

  "Hydatidosis in the province of Salamanca (Spain): should we let down our guard?&lt;||||>Hydatid disease is a major health problem in endemic countries. In Spain, this disease was notifiable from 1981 to 1996, although its incidence kept increasing until the end of this period. From 1997 on, hydatid disease is only surveyed by endemic autonomous regions. Thus, true incidences for human hydatid disease in Spain are currently unknown. In this study the cases recorded from 1996 to 2003 at the Hospital Universitario (Salamanca) which receives patients from all Salamanca province, were analyzed. Method. We obtained epidemiological and clinical data from patients at the University Hospital (reference hospital in Salamanca province) with registered CIE-10 codification 122.0 to 122.9 (hydatid disease), from January 1996 to December 2003, excluding those patients not arriving from Salamanca. We estimated the incidence of hydatid disesase in Salamanca province regarding the total population of the province. Our data show that the mean incidence (1996-2003) was 10,8/100.000 inhabitants, twice as many as previously reported by the notifiable diseases scheme. 30% of infected patients were younger than 45.

  "Doloplus-2, a valid tool for behavioural pain assessment?&lt;||||>The Doloplus-2 is used for behavioural pain assessment in cognitively impaired patients. Little data exists on the psychometric properties of the Doloplus-2. Our objectives were to test the criterion validity and inter-rater reliability of the Doloplus-2, and to explore a design for validations of behavioural pain assessment tools. Fifty-one nursing home patients and 22 patients admitted to a geriatric hospital ward were included. All were cognitively impaired and unable to self-report pain. Each patient was examined by an expert in pain evaluation and treatment, who rated the pain on a numerical rating scale. The ratings were based on information from the medical record, reports from nurses and patients (if possible) about pain during the past 24 hours, and a clinical examination. These ratings were used as pain criterion. The Doloplus-2 was administered by the attending nurse. Regression analyses were used to estimate the ability of the Doloplus-2 to explain the expert's ratings. The inter-rater reliability of the Doloplus-2 was evaluated in 16 patients by comparing the ratings of two nurses administrating the Doloplus-2. There was no association between the Doloplus-2 and the expert's pain ratings (R2 = 0.02). There was an association (R2 = 0.54) between the expert's ratings and the Doloplus-2 scores in a subgroup of 16 patients assessed by a geriatric expert nurse (the most experienced Doloplus-2 administrator). The inter-rater reliability between the Doloplus-2 administrators assessed by the intra-class coefficient was 0.77.

  "Availability of primary care doctors and population health in England: is there an association?&lt;||||>In the United States, an association has been proposed between better access to primary care and lower mortality. This paper reports an ecological analysis that evaluated whether population health was associated with general practitioner (GP) supply in England. Data were analysed for 99 health authorities in England in 1999. Health outcomes included standardized mortality ratios, infant mortality rate (per 1,000), hospital admissions with acute and chronic conditions (per 100,000), and teenage conception rates (per 1,000). The number of GPs per 10,000 population was included as explanatory variable. Confounders included the Townsend deprivation score, proportion of ethnic minorities, proportion in social classes IV and V, and proportion with limiting long-term illness. Analyses were by linear regression weighted for population size. Higher GP supply was associated with lower mortality in univariate analyses. After adjusting for deprivation score, ethnic group and social class, the standardized mortality ratio for all-cause mortality at 15-64 years decreased by -5.2 (95 per cent confidence interval -8.3 to -2.0, p = 0.002) per unit increase in GP supply. After additional adjustment for limiting long-term illness, the decrease was -3.3 (-6.7 to 0.1, p = 0.060). In the fully adjusted model, each unit increase in GP supply was associated with a decrease in hospital admission rates for acute conditions (-14.4, -21.4 to -7.4 per 100,000, p&lt;0.001) and chronic conditions (-10.6, -17.2 to -4.0, p = 0.002)."

To compare the current incidence and patterns of work-related burn injuries treated at our adult regional burn center (Current group) with the findings of a similar study 10 years ago (Early group). Retrospective study of all burn center admissions between 5 December 1998 and 31 December 2000 was completed. The data from the Early and Current groups was analyzed using the Chi-square test of homogeneity. During the study period, 355 patients were hospitalized. After exclusions, 100 occupational burn cases were identified (28%). The mean age of patients was 39+/-12 years, 90% were male. The mean total body surface area (TBSA) burn was 11+/-13.7%. The most common mechanism of burn was electrical (32%), followed by flame (22%), scald (17%), tar (14%), contact (8%), and chemical (7%). Four patients (4%) died of their injuries. There were no significant differences between the Current group and the Early group in terms of incidence, age, gender, occupation, mechanism of burn, or mortality."

  "Is surgical treatment better than conservative treatment for primary patellar dislocations?&lt;||||>Despite several randomized controlled trials comparing operative to nonoperative management of primary patellar dislocation, the optimal management of this condition remains a subject of controversy. The aim of this study was to compare surgical to conservative treatment of outcomes for primary patellar dislocation by meta-analysis all the relative randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis. After searching multiple online databases (MEDILINE, EMBASE, CLINICAL, OVID, BISOS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical trials), eight randomized controlled trials including 430 patients were meta-analyzed in which operative treatment was compared with non-operative treatment for primary patellar dislocation. Outcomes evaluated were redislocation rate, Kujala score, episode of instability, Tegner activity score, Hughston visual analog score (VAS) and patient satisfaction. Outcomes on recurrent patellar dislocation (P = 0.004) and Hughston VAS (P = 0.03) were statistically significant in favor of operative management. Tegner activity score (P&lt;0.00001) was significantly higher in favor of conservative treatment, though only a few studies were identified. There was no significant difference between the two treatments regarding episode of instability (P = 0.41), Kujala score (P = 0.32) or patient satisfaction (P = 0.49)."

  "Failing stentless aortic valves: redo aortic root replacement or valve in a valve?&lt;||||>Reoperation for failing stentless aortic valve replacement is a technically demanding procedure that has traditionally been tackled in one of two ways: either root replacement or the more conservative option of implanting a stented valve within the valve. We sought to determine the relative operative risks, follow-up status and medium to long-term survival of these two methods. We conducted a retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience of the two techniques over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2010. Excluding cases of active endocarditis, 110 patients were identified, of which 65 underwent 'valve-in-valve' procedures ('Group A') and 45 had redo root replacement ('Group B'). The most common bioprostheses reoperated were homografts (roots or subcoronary implants) and Toronto Stentless Porcine Valves. Aortic valve replacement alone was performed in 68% in Group A and 64% in Group B, with males comprising 75% of Group A and 82% of Group B. Average ages were 61.5 ± 14.2 years and 61.9 ± 12.1 years, respectively. Operative and cardiopulmonary bypass durations were significantly greater for redo root procedures and correspondingly, postoperative complications were more common. Thirty-day mortality after valve-in-valve replacement was 3%, and after redo root replacement it was 11%. Despite significantly higher transvalvular gradients in Group B, the symptomatic status was equally good at 2 months, 1 year and last follow-up. At an average interval of 5.1 ± 2.7 years for Group A, survival was 83% vs 76% at 7.3 ± 2.9 years for Group B. There have been two reinterventions in Group A and 3 in Group B.

  "Does atlas-based autosegmentation of neck levels require subsequent manual contour editing to avoid risk of severe target underdosage?&lt;||||>To investigate the dosimetric impact of not editing auto-contours of the elective neck and organs at risk (OAR), generated with atlas-based autosegmentation (ABAS) (Elekta software) for head and neck cancer patients. For nine patients ABAS auto-contours and auto-contours edited by two observers were available. Based on the non-edited auto-contours clinically acceptable IMRT plans were constructed (designated 'ABAS plans'). These plans were then evaluated for the two edited structure sets, by quantifying the percentage of the neck-PTV receiving more than 95% of the prescribed dose (V(95)) and the near-minimum dose (D(99)) in the neck PTV. Dice coefficients and mean contour distances were calculated to quantify the similarity of ABAS auto-contours with the structure sets edited by observer 1 and observer 2. To study the dosimetric importance of editing OAR auto-contours a new IMRT plan was generated for each patient-observer combination, based on the observer's edited CTV and the non-edited salivary gland auto-contours. For each plan mean doses for the non-edited glands were compared with doses for the same glands edited by the observer. For both observers, edited neck CTVs were larger than ABAS auto-contours (p≤ 0.04), by a mean of 8.7%. When evaluating ABAS plans on the PTVs of the edited structure sets, V(95) reduced by 7.2%±5.4% (1 SD) (p&lt;0.03). The mean reduction in D(99) was 14.2 Gy (range 1-54 Gy).

Independent variables included predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. In univariate logistic analyses, Hispanics had worse reports of their ability to always/ usually see their personal doctor, see a specialist, obtain transportation to the clinic, see a doctor for illness/injury when wanted, and see a doctor for routine care when wanted. When adding enabling factors to the models, only reports of the ability to see a doctor for illness or injury and for routine care when wanted remained significant."

This retrospective study was carried out in 2 different hospitals (Istanbul Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital and Kars State Hospital, Kars, Turkey) between January 2004 and December 2007. The data obtained from the patients were classified according to age, gender, age group, and pathological characteristics of the appendix. The data obtained during the Ramadan fasting period was compared with the periods before and after. Nine hundred and ninety-two of the 4288 patients who received a diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the 4 years received their diagnosis during the 3 periods. Three hundred sixty-eight (37.1%) patients underwent surgery before Ramadan, 318 (32.1%) during, and 306 (30.8%) after.

  "A Retrospective Observational Study of Anesthetic Induction Dosing Practices in Female Elderly Surgical Patients: Are We Overdosing Older Patients?&lt;||||>Despite guidelines suggesting a 25-50 % reduction in induction doses of intravenous anesthetic agents in the elderly (≥65 years), we hypothesized that practitioners were not sufficiently correcting drug administration for age, contributing to an increased incidence of hypotension in older patients undergoing general anesthesia. We conducted a retrospective, observational study in a tertiary-care academic hospital. The study included 768 female patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries who received propofol-based induction of general anesthesia. Weight-adjusted anesthetic induction dosing, age-associated differences in dosing by ASA-PS (American Society of Anesthesiology-Physical Status), and hemodynamic outcomes between younger (18-64 years, n = 537) and older (≥65 years, n = 231) female patients were analyzed. Older patients received lower doses of propofol and midazolam than younger patients (propofol: 2.037 ± 0.783 vs 2.322 ± 0.834 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.001; midazolam: 0.013 ± 0.014 vs 0.023 ± 0.042 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.001). However, practitioners still consistently exceeded the FDA recommended dose (1-1.5 mg/kg) of propofol for elderly patients. There was no significant difference in the doses of fentanyl administered between the two age groups (1.343 ± 0.744 vs 1.363 ± 0.763 μg/kg, p = 0.744), and doses of fentanyl in older patients exceeded the recommended dose (0.5-1.0 μg/kg).

Twenty-two sinuses of 12 patients (mean age 56.2+/-9.3 years) were grafted. Four weeks before, SG bone biopsies were obtained with a trephine burr and the bone cells were isolated and expanded. Every sinus was grafted with BBM and ABC. After 6 months, a biopsy was taken from each sinus and implants (n=82) were placed. These were uncovered after another 6 months and fitted with dentures. The percent newly formed bone (NB) and the NB-to-BBM contact area were determined on undecalcified histologic sections. The sinus graft volume was evaluated by dental CT after SG (CT 1), after implant placement (CT 2) and after implant uncovery (CT 3). Postoperative healing was uneventful. The NB was 17.9+/-4.6% and the contact area 26.8+/-13.1%.

  "Cementoplasty of metastases of the proximal femur: is it a safe palliative option?&lt;||||>Percutaneous cementoplasty has proved very effective for the palliation of pain from bone metastases. However, several studies argue that it should be contraindicated for metastases that are located in the proximal femur because of inadequate bone consolidation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for fracture despite performing cementoplasty for metastases of the proximal femur. We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients who underwent cementoplasty for metastases of the proximal femur who had a high risk for fracture (N = 21) from June 2003 to October 2010. Cementoplasty was performed for preventive consolidation as well as for pain palliation in 16 patients. The risk factors studied were the patient characteristics, the Mirels score, the maximal size and cortical involvement of the lesion, and a history of a previous fracture of the lesser trochanter. The 1-year pathologic fracture rate was 40.6% (seven fractures). The risk of fracture was significantly higher for cortical involvement greater than 30 mm (n = 7/11 vs n = 0/10; P = .0005) and a history of a previous fracture of the lesser trochanter (n = 3/3 vs 4/18; P = .0009)."

Data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980) and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1982-1984) were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) for hypertension for each ethnic group, with adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes status. Comparisons were made to assess whether the magnitude for the ethnicity ORs changed when the three nutrient variables were entered into the model. Mexican-American and Puerto Rican men and women showed clinically and statistically significantly higher mean intakes of the three cations than did African-American men and women, who reported clinically and statistically significantly lower mean intakes of sodium, potassium, and calcium than did European-American men and women.

We have studied the correlation of tissue fibrocyte levels to basement membrane thickness and the presence of fibrocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in steroid-naive patients with mild asthma and controls. Patients with mild asthma (n = 9) were recruited and divided into two categories based on whether or not fibroblast-like cells could be established from BALF. Non-asthmatic healthy subjects (n = 5) were used as controls. Colocalization of the fibrocyte markers CD34, CD45RO, procollagen I, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were identified in bronchial biopsies from patients and controls by confocal microscopy. Kruskall-Wallis method was used to calculate statistical significance and Spearman coefficient of rank correlation was used to assess the degree of association. In patients with BALF fibroblasts, a 14-fold increase of tissue cells expressing CD34/CD45RO/alpha-SMA and a 16-fold increase of tissue cells expressing CD34/procollagen I was observed when compared to controls (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, patients without BALF fibroblasts displayed a 2-fold increase when compared to controls (p&lt;0.05). Fibrocytes were localized close to the basement membrane which was significantly thicker in patients with BALF fibroblasts when compared to the other two groups of subjects. Furthermore, basement membrane thickness could be correlated to the number of fibrocytes in tissue (r = 0.711). Fibroblasts-like cells were cultured from BALF where 17.6% of these cells expressed CD34, CD45RO and alpha-SMA."

The concordance between adolescents' self-assessment of sexual maturation using the PDS and those of an expert rating by a trained health professional using the Sexual Maturation Scale (SMS) were determined in a group (n = 182; 49% female) of Black South African youth aged between 10 and 18 years recruited from schools in Soweto, South Africa. Furthermore, the concordance between adolescents' self-assessment of puberty using the PDS and a previously validated self-assessment technique using SMS was also determined in a large group (n = 1388; 53% female) of young adolescents aged 13 years old participating in a birth cohort from Soweto-Johannesburg. The convergent validity of PDS proved to be poor with several PDS items (facial hair, skin change, and growth) proving unreliable both within the school survey across the different age groups when compared to SMS (kappa coefficient of 0.34 for females and undetermined for males), as well as, within the cohort of 13-year-olds (kappa coefficient of 0.16 for females and 0.19 for males)."

  "P0 antigen detection in sudden hearing loss and Ménière's disease: a new diagnostic marker?&lt;||||>To evaluate the presence of IgG autoantibodies against the P0 antigen in patients affected by sudden hearing loss and Meniere's disease (MD). All patients underwent a tonal audiometric evaluation, tympanometry, evaluation of the stapedial reflex threshold with decay time, determination of auditory brainstem responses and a complete vestibular assessment involving evaluation of spontaneous and positional nystagmus (Frenzel glasses), a head thrust test and a caloric test (Fitzgerald-Hallpike technique). Blood samples were drawn from all patients for the immunologic assessment of IgG antibodies against the P0 antigen (30-kDa protein) of guinea pig inner ear extracts using a Western blot assay. Ten patients affected by sudden hearing loss showed specific IgG antibodies against the P0 protein. Specifically, the P0 positive band was detectable in 5/45 patients with unilateral auditory impairment and in 5/5 of those with bilateral forms of auditory impairment. Among MD patients, the P0 positive band was detectable only in those with bilateral audiovestibular impairment (n = 10). Interestingly, in none of the 35 patients affected by monolateral MD were specific IgG antibodies against the P0 protein detectable."

  "Can epinephrine inhalations be substituted for epinephrine injection in children at risk for systemic anaphylaxis?&lt;||||>For out-of-hospital treatment of anaphylaxis, inhalation of epinephrine from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler is sometimes recommended as a noninvasive, user-friendly alternative to an epinephrine injection. To determine the feasibility of administering an adequate epinephrine dose from a metered-dose inhaler in children at risk for anaphylaxis by assessing the rate and extent of epinephrine absorption after inhalation. We performed a prospective, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 19 asymptomatic children with a history of anaphylaxis. Based on the child's weight, 10, 15, or 20 carefully supervised epinephrine or placebo inhalations were attempted. Before dosing, and at intervals from 5 to 180 minutes after dosing, we monitored plasma epinephrine concentrations, blood glucose, heart rate, blood pressure, and adverse effects. Eleven children (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 9 +/- 1 years and 33 +/- 3 kg) in the epinephrine group were able to inhale 11 +/- 2 (range: 3-20) puffs, equivalent to 74% +/- 7% of the precalculated dose or 0.078 +/- 0.009 mg/kg. They achieved a mean peak plasma epinephrine concentration of 1822 +/- 413 (range: 230-4518) pg/mL at 32.7 +/- 6.2 minutes. Eight children (10 +/- 1 years of age and 33 +/- 5 kg) in the placebo group were able to inhale 12 +/- 2 (range: 8-20) puffs, 89% +/- 3% of the precalculated dose, and had a peak endogenous plasma epinephrine concentration of 1316 +/- 247 (range: 522-2687) pg/mL at 44.4 +/- 16.7 minutes. In the children receiving epinephrine compared with those receiving placebo, mean plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significantly higher at any time, mean blood glucose concentrations were significantly higher from 10 to 30 minutes, mean heart rate was not significantly different at any time, and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not significantly increased at most times.

  "Are metabolic syndrome and its components associated with lower urinary tract symptoms?&lt;||||>To investigate the association between severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in a large male population in China. Data were collected from 3103 men attending the Fangchenggang Area Male Healthy and Examination Survey (FAMHES) from September 2009 to December 2009. LUTS were assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and MetS were defined using a modification of the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Blood samples were drawn to determine serum lipids and glucose levels. Comprehensive information on demographic characteristics and medication was also collected through questionnaires. The association between LUTS and MetS was presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated using a logistic regression model. The presence of MetS was not associated with the severity of LUTS (multivariate OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.67-1.39), but its subcategories of moderate or severe storage symptoms were inversely related to MetS (multivariate OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.44-0.91). Aging was observed to be a major risk factor for LUTS, such that men 60 years or older experienced 2-fold the odds of moderate or severe LUTS (OR=2.79, 95% CI=1.82-4.29) when compared with men 40 years or less).

An increasing awareness of gender differences in tumor stage at bladder cancer presentation has led to speculation about delayed referral and diagnosis in women. However, little is known about the referral patterns of hematuria and whether gender differences exist. The insurance records were examined from 926 consecutive adult health plan participants (559 men and 367 women) with newly diagnosed hematuria from 1998 to 2002. The patterns of urologic referral were evaluated. A Cox multivariate regression model was used to examine the relationship between urologic referral and the relevant variables. Overall, 263 men (47%) and 102 women (28%) were referred for urologic evaluation of hematuria, with a median follow-up of 27 and 26 months, respectively. Referral was initiated by the primary care physician in 80% of the cohort. Increased urologic referral was associated with advancing age, repeated hematuria, provider type, and male gender.

Furthermore, it was hypothesized that males with PFP would demonstrate greater varus alignment. A gait and single-leg squat analysis was conducted on each group (18 runners per group). Measurement of each runner's tibial mechanical axis was also recorded. Motion data were processed using Visual 3D (C-Motion, Bethesda, MD). ANOVAs were used to analyze the data. Males with PFP ran and squatted in greater peak knee adduction and demonstrated greater peak knee external adduction moment compared with healthy male controls. In addition, males with PFP ran and squatted with less peak hip adduction and greater peak knee adduction compared with females with PFP.

Mann-Whitney U tests were performed on the pain and anxiety scores and analysis of variance was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. A total of 92 patients were randomized to 39 in the waiting group and 53 in the control group. Mean overall pain scores were 2.85 and 2.66 (P = 0.626) for the waiting and control groups, respectively.

Efficacy parameters included changes from baseline in LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and lipoprotein subclasses (Vertical Auto Profile II) and pattern for the overall population, as well as patient subgroups with baseline triglyceride levels&lt;150 mg/dL or ≥150 mg/dL. Both treatments significantly reduced LDL-C (and the cholesterol content of most LDL subfractions [LDL1-4]) apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C levels, but did not reduce the proportion of smaller, more dense LDL particles; in fact, the proportion of Pattern B was numerically increased. Results were generally similar in patients with triglyceride levels&lt;150 or ≥150 mg/dL."

  "Does interview mode matter for food security measurement?&lt;||||>To assess whether interview mode (telephone vs. in-person) affects the results of surveys that measure food security. Responses given by households interviewed by telephone and in-person in recent US Current Population Survey Food Security Supplements (CPS-FSS) were compared. Statistical methods based on the Rasch measurement model were used to assess whether response patterns differed between the two interview modes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to gauge the effect of interview mode on the measured household prevalence rates of food insecurity and very low food security while controlling for income, employment, household structure, and other household characteristics that affect food security. Response patterns to the indicators that comprise the food security scale did not differ substantially between interview modes.

We investigated whether the effects of GLP-1 on gastric emptying, appetite, and food intake are mediated directly or indirectly via release of amylin. Eleven C-peptide and amylin-negative patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 12 matched healthy controls participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, single-blinded, crossover study. With glucose clamped between 6 and 9 mm, near-physiological infusions of GLP-1, human amylin, pramlintide, or saline were given for 270 min during and after a fixed meal. Gastric emptying was measured using paracetamol, appetite using visual analog scales, and food intake during a subsequent ad libitum meal (at 240 min). In T1DM, gastric emptying, food intake, and appetite were reduced equally during low GLP-1 and amylin infusion compared with the saline infusion (P&lt;0.05). The controls showed stronger suppression of gastric emptying (P&lt;0.0001) and food intake (P&lt;0.01) with GLP-1 compared to amylin.

Three hundred and twenty-six pregnant women presenting to the emergency department at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from March 1999 through March 2000 were recruited and followed through 22 weeks gestation. Cases were women who experienced a spontaneous abortion and controls were women who maintained their pregnancy. Stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Prenatal Social Environment Inventory (PSEI) and the Index of Spousal Abuse (ISA) prior to confirmation of spontaneous abortion. Blood samples were collected to measure cortisol and sex hormone levels. Urine samples were collected to assess cotinine, cocaine and marijuana use. No relationship was found between psychosocial stress, as determined by the three stress scales or cortisol level, and the risk for spontaneous abortion. Women with high stress, as measured by the PSEI, were more likely to use cigarettes and marijuana during pregnancy. High psychosocial stress during early pregnancy was not related to spontaneous abortion but high stress was associated with substance use during pregnancy."

  "Comparison of EVAR and open repair in patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysms: can we predict results of the PIVOTAL trial?&lt;||||>Data from multicenter studies support observation of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) over open repair (OR), but the role of endovascular repair (EVAR) is unclear pending outcome of the Positive Impact of EndoVascular Options for Treating Aneurysm earLy (PIVOTAL) trial. Our goal was to predict the outcome of the trial by comparing results of small AAA repair using EVAR vs OR at a tertiary institution. Using selection criteria of PIVOTAL trial, we reviewed clinical data of 194 consecutive patients, who underwent EVAR or OR for 4.0-5.0 cm AAAs between 1997 and 2004. All-cause and aneurysm-related deaths, complications, reinterventions, ruptures, and conversions were documented; factors affecting outcome were analyzed using chi(2) tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic regression Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (range, 1 month to 9 years). A total of 194 patients, 162 males, 32 females (mean age: 71 years, range, 46-86) underwent 162 OR and 32 EVAR. EVAR patients were older (mean 74 +/- 6 vs 71 +/- 7, P = .002), had lower ejection fraction (mean 54 +/- 11 vs 61 +/- 13, P = .0002), and less likely to have ever smoked (69% vs 85%, P = .03) than OR patients. Thirty-day mortality was 1.3% (2/162) for OR and 0% for EVAR (0/33) (P = not significant [NS]). There were 49 systemic complications (7 EVAR, 42 OR, P = NS) and 10 local complications (3 EVAR, 7 OR, P = NS). During follow-up, there were no conversions and no ruptures. Freedom from reinterventions at 5 years was 83.1% +/- 6.9% for EVAR and 95.3% +/- 1.8% for OR (P = 0.02). There were 26 deaths (3 EVAR, 23 OR); but no procedure or aneurysm-related death was confirmed after 30 days (cause unknown in 16 deaths, 62%). Survival rates at 1-year were 96.6% +/- 3.4% for EVAR and 97.4% +/- 1.3% for OR; 5-year rates were 86.9% +/- 7.2% +/- EVAR and 86.9% +/- 3.3% for OR (P = 0.69). Multivariate analysis revealed age (hazard ratio = 1.1 per year, P = .0496) and AAA size (hazard ratio = 13.8 per 1 cm, P = .03) were associated with death but EVAR vs OR was not (P = .23)."

(2) What is the influence of CTRA on providers' treatment recommendations in simulated clinical scenarios of metastatic bone disease of the femur? (3) Does CTRA improve interobserver agreement regarding treatment recommendations? We conducted a survey among 80 academic physicians (orthopaedic oncologists, musculoskeletal radiologists, and radiation oncologists) using simulated vignettes of femoral lesions presented as three separate scenarios: (1) no CTRA input (baseline); (2) CTRA input suggesting increased risk of fracture (CTRA+); and (3) CTRA input suggesting decreased risk of fracture (CTRA-). Participants were asked to rate the patient's risk of fracture on a scale of 0% to 100% and to provide a treatment recommendation. Overall response rate was 62.5% (50 of 80). When CTRA suggested an increased risk of fracture, physicians perceived the fracture risk to be slightly greater (37% ± 3% versus 42% ± 3%, p&lt;0.001; mean difference [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 5% [4.7%-5.2%]) and were more prone to recommend surgical stabilization (46% ± 9% versus 54% ± 9%, p&lt;0.001; mean difference [95% CI] = 9% [7.9-10.1]).

We further show that IRX3 expression was elevated in isolated adipocytes and AT of lean compared to obese children, particularly in UCP1-negative adipocytes, and inversely correlated with BMI SDS. Independent of BMI, IRX3 expression in adipocytes was significantly related to adipocyte hypertrophy, and subsequent associations with AT inflammation and HOMA-IR in the children."

The results after this action were analyzed. We selected 2 groups: good outcome and poor outcome. Eight patients showed good results including stabilization or improvement of graft function. Five patients presented poor results requiring chronic hemodialysis. C4d staining was negative in all biopsy specimens, and peritubular capillaritis was not observed. To identify potential prognostic markers we retrospectively reviewed biopsy samples looking for minor or nonspecific features, especially inflammation scores both global and on fibrotic areas as per Banff classification.

  "Adverse Cardiovascular Response to Aerobic Exercise Training: Is This a Concern?&lt;||||>Aerobic exercise training in sedentary individuals improves physical fitness and various cardiovascular (CV) biomarkers. Nevertheless, there has been controversy as to whether exercise training may adversely affect some biomarkers in a small segment of the population. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether clinically significant worsening of CV biomarkers was more prevalent among individuals randomized to a supervised endurance training program as compared with those randomized to a control condition. Baseline and end of study measurements of fasting insulin (FI), triglycerides (TG), resting systolic blood pressure (SBP), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were obtained on 1188 healthy sedentary subjects from 4 clinical studies. Each study randomized subjects to 4- to 6-month supervised aerobic exercise programs or to a control group of no supervised exercise training. For each of the 4 CV biomarkers, we calculated the respective proportions of control and exercise group subjects whose baseline-to-follow-up changes were greater than or equal to previously reported adverse change (AC) thresholds. Those thresholds were increases of 24 pmol · L(-1) or greater for FI, 0.42 mmol · L(-1) or greater for TG, 10 mm Hg or greater for SBP, and a decrease of 0.12 mmol · L(-1) or greater for HDL-C. The respective proportions of subjects meeting the AC threshold in the control and exercise groups were 15.2% versus 9.6% (P = 0.02) for FI, 14.9% versus 13.1% (P = 0.37) for TG, 16.9% versus 15.8% (P = 0.52) for SBP, and 28.6% versus 22.5% (P = 0.03) for HDL-C. All were nonsignificant at the 0.0125 Bonferroni threshold adjusting for multiple comparisons."

  "Pleural fluid accumulation detectable on paediatric post-mortem imaging: a possible marker of interval since death?&lt;||||>The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate whether pleural fluid accumulates following death in a predictable manner, in particular whether such collections are related to post-mortem interval. Images acquired by post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR) were both subjectively and objectively assessed for extent of pleural fluid accumulation. Total thoracic volume and pleural fluid volume were calculated using segmentation functions on OSIRIX software. The percentage of pleural fluid as a percentage of thoracic volume was calculated, to account for variation in subject size. The cause of death as per the final autopsy report and the interval from death to imaging were also recorded. Twelve perinatal deaths/stillbirths (mean gestation 38 weeks, range 24-48 weeks, male/female 5:7) and 11 childhood deaths (mean age 1 year, range 1 day-4 years, male/female 3:8) were assessed. The mean interval from death to imaging for all cases was 7.5 days (range 1-23 days). Pleural fluid was present in almost all cases, and the mean percentage pleural effusion as a proportion of thoracic volume was 3.3 % (range 0.2-9.5 %). There was a significant correlation between the post-mortem interval and the amount of pleural fluid in childhood deaths (p &lt; 0.05) but no significant relationship for perinatal deaths."

  "Is left ventricular hypertrophy a powerful predictor of progression to dialysis in chronic kidney disease?&lt;||||>The role of cardiovascular factors in predicting renal outcome has not been extensively elucidated. Herein, we report a prospective evaluation of the impact of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on outcome in non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We studied 144 patients (99 men; age 62±14 years) with stage 3-4 CKD, with baseline assessment of left ventricular mass index (LVMi) by echocardiography, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by MDRD equation, 24-h blood pressure profile and 24-h proteinuria. Combined end point was progression to ESRD requiring dialysis, or death within 5 years. Forty-nine patients (34%) progressed to dialysis, 24 (17%) died, 57 (39%) were dialysis-free after 5 years and 14 were lost to follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that increased LVMi (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17-1.40 for each 10-g/m2 increase, P&lt;0.0001) and reduced eGFR (5% risk increase for each 1-mL/min reduction, P=0.027) were the significant predictors of the combined end point in stage 3 CKD patients, whereas LVMi proved to be the only significant predictor of the combined end point in patients with stage 4 CKD (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.31, P&lt;0.0001). The same analysis showed that LVMi was the only significant predictor of progression to dialysis in stage 3 CKD patients (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.23-1.64 for each 10-g/m2 increase, P&lt;0.0001), while a 20% increase in the risk of progression to ESRD was observed for each 10-g/m2 increase in LVMi (P&lt;0.0001), and a 10% increase for each 1-mL/min reduction in eGFR (P=0.046) in patients with stage 4 CKD. When evaluating the predictive role of LVMi on outcome using AUC-ROC curves, the overall performance of the model including LVMi (AUC 0.877, 95% CI 0.8-0.954) was superior to the model including eGFR (AUC 0.737, 95% CI 0.656-0.817) for the end point of progression to dialysis (P=0.026, Hanley test)."

  "Is antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, or stillbirth?&lt;||||>Data on complications of pregnancy associated with antiretroviral therapy are limited. Some small studies have demonstrated an increased preterm delivery rate, but a recent retrospective United States multisite study did not concur with these findings. Our objective was to investigate whether antiretroviral therapy was associated with adverse pregnancy outcome at a single site. Using prospectively gathered data, women were identified who were determined to be human immunodeficiency virus positive before or during pregnancy who sought care at our prenatal clinic and who gave birth at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center from 1990 through 2002. The outcome measures were preterm delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth. The cohort included 999 women who received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy (monotherapy in 492, combination therapy without a protease inhibitor [PI] in 373, and combination therapy with a PI in 134) and 338 women who did not receive therapy. After adjustment for possible confounders, only combination therapy with a PI was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, compared with any other combination (odds ratio, 1.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.0]). There were no differences in rates of low birth weight and stillbirth, regardless of therapy."

  "Does a pre-operative urodynamic diagnosis of bladder outflow obstruction improve outcomes from palliative transurethral prostatectomy?&lt;||||>Palliative transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) is the mainstay of treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms, (LUTS) in men with prostate cancer. Functional outcomes, however, can often be unsatisfactory. Here the value of preoperative urodynamics was investigated in these men. A retrospective review was conducted of 41 men with prostate cancer and LUTS who were investigated by urodynamics prior to TURP. All were treated solely by primary androgen deprivation. 19 men with urodynamic proven bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) proceeded to palliative TURP. Of the 41 men investigated by cystometry, the urodynamic diagnosis was BOO in 12 (29%) men, detrusor overactivity in 12 (29%) men with 7 (17%) having both diagnoses. 6 (15%) men were found to have underactive or acontractile detrusors while 4 (10%) had normal studies. In men who proceeded to TURP, all demonstrated improved flow rates (p = 0.003). At 12 months, 95% were voiding spontaneously with only 1 man requiring permanent re-catheterisation. These results compared very favourably to published outcomes which have not used urodynamics to select men for surgery."

  "Is there a role for body mass index in the assessment of prostate cancer risk on biopsy?&lt;||||>We examine the role of body mass index in the assessment of prostate cancer risk. A total of 3,258 participants who underwent biopsy (including 1,902 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer) were identified from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. The associations of body mass index with prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer were examined using logistic regression, adjusting for age, race, body mass index adjusted prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination, family history of prostate cancer, biopsy history, prostate specific antigen velocity, and time between study entry and the last biopsy. The prediction models were compared with our previously developed body mass index adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer risk calculator. Of the study subjects 49.1% were overweight and 29.3% were obese. After adjustment, among men without a known family history of prostate cancer, increased body mass index was not associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer (per one-unit increase in logBMI OR 0.83, p=0.54) but was significantly associated with a higher risk of high grade prostate cancer (ie Gleason score 7 or greater prostate cancer) (OR 2.31, p=0.03). For men with a known family history of prostate cancer the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer increased rapidly as body mass index increased (prostate cancer OR 3.73, p=0.02; high grade prostate cancer OR 7.95, p=0.002).

The results comparing bleeding classifications demonstrate that the rate of severe bleeding complications may increase up to 4 times when different classifications are used on the same group of patients (TIMI 9.4%, GUSTO 15.1%, PLATO 39.2% and BARC 35.9%). The power of association between severe bleeding determined by these classifications and real hemodynamic compromise using Kendall's tau-c correlation is -0.4106 (95% CI -0.599 to -0.222), -0.5355 (95% CI -0.718 to -0.353), -0.5513 (95% CI -0.729 to -0.374) and -0.7552 (95% CI -0.897 to -0.612) for TIMI, GUSTO, PLATO and BARC, respectively."

  "Is prompt surgical treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm justified for someone in their eighties?&lt;||||>The aim of this study is to review the early and long-term results and quality of life after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery in octogenarians to justify our prompt surgical intervention. We reviewed the consecutive 444 patients who underwent graft replacement of AAA in our center from October 1997 to September 2002. The median age of the patients was 72.3. An elective operation was carried out in 401 cases (90.3%) and an emergency operation in 43 cases (9.7%). We evaluated the early and long-term results of AAA surgical treatment, including the quality of life after hospital discharge. There were 12 hospital deaths (2.7%) in the early outcomes, 11 of which (25.6%) were during emergency operations, and only one patient (0.2%) died among the elective cases (p&lt;.0001). In the early results, the emergency operation (p = 0.0001) was the only risk factor in the early deaths investigated by the multivariate logistic regression; patients aged 80 years and over did not constitute a risk factor. There were 36 late deaths, but none related to AAA surgical treatment. The strongest predictors for late mortality included patients aged 80 years and over (p = 0.027), male gender (p = 0.048), chronic renal failure with preoperative serum creatinine level equal to or greater than 1.5 mg/dl (p = 0.043), a history of atherosclerotic obliterans (p = 0.009), and an emergency operation (p&lt;.001) investigated by the Cox hazard multivariate logistic regression.

Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want.

The suture line was covered with approximately 2 mL of either type of FS and blood flow was restored. Blood loss was absorbed by gauze and measured. All rabbits were recovered and underwent histologic examination 4 weeks after operation. The efficacy of FS was also tested under a high-fibrinolytic state by treating the rabbits with human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (0.15 mg/kg, 3-hour infusion). The investigators were blinded to the treatment groups. The majority (11 of 12) of deaths occurred because of bleeding at the suture line within 7 days of surgery. Sustained hemostasis by FS (>1 week) was required for normal tissue healing and long-term survival of animals. Application of ARC-FS to the suture line produced immediate hemostasis in 43% of animals (three of seven), with mean blood loss of 4.8 +/- 1.8 mL, and 86% long-term survival. Tisseel application produced immediate hemostasis in 13% of animals (one of eight), with mean blood loss of 26.9 +/- 7.0 mL (p&lt;0.05 vs. ARC-FS) and survival rate of 37% (three of eight). Under high-fibrinolytic conditions, ARC-FS produced immediate and complete hemostasis in seven of eight animals (88%), whereas the Tisseel demonstrated complete hemostasis in one of seven (p&lt;0.01). The ARC-FS rabbits had a blood loss of 1.9 +/- 1.9 mL and survival rate of 75% (six of eight), whereas the Tisseel animals had a mean blood loss of 30 +/- 6.0 mL and survival rate of 43% (three of seven) (p&lt;0.01). No detrimental effect on healing was noted with either product."

  "Stenting as a Bridge to Surgery for Obstructive Colon Cancer: Does It Have Surgical Merit or Oncologic Demerit?&lt;||||>To evaluate the surgical and oncologic outcomes of patients undergoing self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement with elective curative surgery. Data from patients admitted with obstructing colon cancer between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent either SEMS placement as a bridge to surgery (stent group, n = 67) or emergency surgery (surgery group, n = 35). Surgical and oncologic outcomes of the groups were compared. Placement of SEMS was technically successful in 98.5% and clinically successful in 89.6% of cases. There were eight (11.9%) stent-related complications, including three migrations (4.5%), four occlusions (6.0%), and one perforation (1.5%). The stent group had a higher laparoscopic resection rate (67.2 vs. 31.4%, p = 0.001) with a lower conversion rate (4.3 vs. 35.3%, p = 0.003). The wound infection rate was significantly higher in the surgery group (37.1 vs. 11.9%, p = 0.003) with no differences in the rate of other complications. The rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis, recurrence-free, and overall survival were not significantly different between the two groups."
