The van of\nthe luggage train and a waggon, loaded with iron, were smashed\nto pieces, but no serious personal injury was sustained.\nFATAL QUARREL IN AN AaIEBICAN SHIP AT BALACLAVA.\n—From a letter received from Balaclava, on the 26th ult., we\nlearn that a tragedy, attended with fatal results, occurred on\nboard the American ship Arlington. One of the men, in an\naltercation with the mate, struck him, when the latter armed\nhimself: ith a pistol, and discharged its contents into the\nchest of the unfortunate man. This wanton abuse of power\noccurred at an anchorage where there were upwards of fifty\nsail to render assistance in case of mutiny.\nFEARFUL THUNDERSTORM.—On Tuesday afternoon Not-\ntingham and the immediate neighbourhood were visited by a\nterrible thunderstorm, which lasted for nearly three hours,\nraging during that time with remarkable violence. The rain\nfell in torrents, accompanied by hailstones of a very large\nsize. The storm commenced about three o'clock, and con-\ntinued, with very little intermission, until six.

The mother is\nMiss Beatrice Jane Jones, the daughter of a Church of Eng.\nland clergyman residing at Douglas, Isle of Man. Various\nproceedings have taken place in the case, but the result of the\ninvestigation on Wednesday was that the county magistrates\nconfirmed the previous order, directing Mr. Singleton to pay\n2s. ed. per week during 13 years for the maintenance of the\nchild.\nA STATEMENT has been issued by Mr. James Low, from\nwhich it appears that the shipments of specie from England\nto India, China, Egypt, and Malta for the half year just\nended have been £2,614,006, of which, £396,847 consisted of\ngold, and £2,117,169 of silver. As compared with the cor-\nresponding half of 1864, this shows an increase of £140,992,\nalthough the total export was then unusually large. The\nproportion of gold, however, is smaller in the present return.\nThe sum inclUded in the aggregate total as having been sent\nto China this half year is £833,466, of which all but £140,524\nwas silver. In the first six months of 1864 the total sent to\nChina was £1,289,548. The recent augmentation in the ship-\nments to the East, has, therefore, been caused exclusively by\nthe Indian demand.\nNEWSPAPERS FOR THE BRITISH COLONIES AND FOREIGN\nCOUNTRIES.—The following notice has been issued from the\nGeneral Post-office :—\&quot; Many newspapers for British colonies\nand foreign countries having been posted unpaid,. contrary to\nthe Printed Instructions, No. 45,1855, recently issued upon\nthe subject, the Postmaster-General thinks it necessary to\nrepeat the intimation that a postage (the amount of which\ncan be ascertained by an inspection of the notice No. 45, at\nany post-office) is now required to be pre-paid, in addition to\nthe newspaper stamp, upon all newspapers sent to the British\nColonies, and upon those sent to all foreign countries except\nthe following, namely,—France or Algeria, Belgium Prussia\nrid Belgium, and any foreign country (except Turkey) rid\nBelgium and Prussia, New Granada, Peru.

Mr. Holland was declared duly elected. In\nreturning\n.thanks he said he was for a vigorous prosecution of\nthe war, and not only of the war, but of everything right and\njust, whether at home or abroad. He was not a member for\nany particular class of politicians, but for every class, for every\nelector, and every non-elector,\nDISTRESSING OCCURRENCE.—Two young ladies, the daugh-\nters of J. H. Rees, Esq., of Carmarthen, were bathing, on\nSaturday, on the shore, near their father's house, when, having\nventured too far, they sank in a pool about ten feet in depth.\nTheir governess, who was with them, rushed to their rescue,\nand, failing to save, died with them. Mr. Rees was hastily\nsummoned from a meeting which he was attending at the\nchurch, and on coining out, the first objects which met his\ngaze were the lifelessbodies of his children and governess, which\nwere being borne along to his house.\nREPRESENTATION OF THE CITY'.—We understand that a\nmovement is now being made, with the view of gettieg up a\nrequisition, calling on Lord John Russell and Baron Rothschild\nto resign their seats for the city. The, ground on which Lord\nJohn is to be called on to resign is, that he grossly misrepre-\nsents the sentiments of his constituents on the question of the\nwar ; while the reason which is to be urged for the resignation\nof the Baron, is, that he does not represent them at. all.\nThere is, we are assured, a large and influential party\n,in the\ncity, who are determined that it shall be hereafter efficiently\nrepresented in the House of Commons.—Advertiser.\nEXTRAORDINARY ESCAPE OF THE CREW OF A STEAIiTUG\nAT SHIELDS.—The Welsh, a tug steamer belonging to Sun-\nderland, brought a foreign schooner into Shields from sea on\nTuesday, and after seeing her moored, the master of the\nsteamer went on board the schooner to get his towage. He\nhad not been on board the schooner above a minute, and the\nother two men belonging to her were standing forward in the\nsteamer, when her boiler exploded with fearful violence.\nIn an instant it blew everything in the cabin to pieces, and\nforced out the stern and after deck. The boat immediately\nsank, but, strange to say, the two men were rescued without\nhaving sustained the least injury. The steamer has since been\nraised, and it is found that her engine is all twisted and de-\nstroyed.__\nTHOSE who have implicit faith in the universal \&quot; honour\nof the English Tradesman,\&quot; and a fortiori of \&quot; the British\nBanker,\&quot; may be surprised to hear a story which is current in\n'commercial circles, and is as well authenticated as it is gene-\nrally believed. A highly-respected London banker, on his\ndeath-bed, called his.children round him, and asked them if\nthey believed in his reputed wealth ? They answered that\nthey shared the general opinion as to his large fortune, and\nhe then surprised them by the assurance that he had been\ninsolvent for the last thirty years. He, however, entreated\nthem not to be depressed by the intelligence; but recom-\nmended them to go to Doctor's Commons immediately after\nhis decease and swear his property under half a million. The\nadvice was taken. The customers of the house were agreeably\nedified on hearing of the enormous wealth of the late partner,\nand the bank was firmer than ever, in the opinion of those\nwho trusted their money to its keeping.\nTHE STOLEN £5OO -NOTE.—A communication has been\nreceived from one of the jury who were supposed to.have given\na verdict for the plaintiff in the Court of Common Pleas, at\nGuildhall, on Tuesday last, in an action brought on behalf of\nM. St. Paul, a moneychanger in Paris, against the- Bank -of\nEngland, to recover a £5OO bank note, forming one of those\nstolen from Messrs. Brown; Shipley, and Co., to the effect that\nthe jury-.did not intend to express, and had by no means arrived\nat a conclusion favourable to the right of the plaintiff. The\nfeelingof a large portion of them, at least, is stated to have\nbeen that M. St. Paul, having received notice of the robbery,\nand liming wilfully disregarded it, or, at all events, having\nadopted no steps to give effect to it, could not be considered to\nhave-taken the-note-hostel fide. The question is one of so much\nmoment as to make it important that the law should not be\nsettled on a misunderstanding of the intention of the jury,\nand 'hence it is deemed -essential that their views Should be\nascertained on the point more clearly than appears to have\nbeen possible in the hurried manner in which their verdict\nwas taken.— Timer.\n\nPOLICY OF PnrssrA.—According to the Berlin correspond-\nent of the Times, the opinion prevalent in that capital is\n\&quot;that the Prussian Royal Family and the Court are bound\nhand and foot, and sold body and soul to Russia.\&quot; He adds :\n\&quot; The before-mentioned view is based on the fact of a Prussian\nPrincess being the consort of the Emperor of Russia who was\nreigning at the time of this conflict being brought about by\nhim, on the very strong presumption of there being a power-\nful party at Court here imbued with Russian sympathies, and\nthe patent factthat Prussia has not openly and actively joined\nua in the struggle against Russia. The three facts are cor-\nrect, but the_imputed cause of Prussia's policy is incorrect;\nthere are so many perfectly valid reasons, military, financial,\npolitical, and economical, to withhold Prussia from taking a\nforward part in the war, however convinced King, Ministers,\nand people may be of the necessity of profiting.by the present\nopportunity of •asserting the independence of the country; that\nwe have no need to suppose feelings of brotherly affection on\nthe part of the King, or political sympathies for Russia on the\npart of certain members of the Court, to have been more than\nsubordinate accessories in determining the course that Prussia\n\&quot;has hitherto:taken.\&quot;\nANECDOTE or THE QUEEN.—A few days ago, in the\nbeautiful little cemetery of Rose Bank, our attention was\ndirected to a handsome monument of Aberdeen granite,\nhaving the following inscription in letters of geld:—\&quot; Sacred\nto tno memory of Miss Ida Deno.uorai, tine foltlAful\nesteemed dresser of Queen Victoria, who departed this life\nOctober 15, 1804, in the thirty-seventh year, of her age, be-\nloved and respected by all who knew her. This stone has\nbeen placed' by Queen Victoria as a mark of her regard.\&quot; On\ninquiry we found that one day, whether in the autumn of\n1.-864 or at a former period we were not told, when Miss Be-\nnanomi was accompanying Queen Victoria in her morning\nwalk on Arthur's Seat, she called her Majesty's attention to\nthe beautiful cemetery in the distant valley, and expressed a\nwish that when she died she might be buried there. Last\nyear, when her Majesty was going north, Miss Benanomi,\nwho, as usual, was attending her royal mistress, became in-\ndisposed in Holyrood Palace, and was unable to proceed fur-\nther. By order of Her Majesty, Miss Benanomi was attended\nby an eminent physician, but she never recovered, and died\nin Holyrood Palace. Her Majesty was deeply affected by the\ndeath, and, remembering the wish of Miss Benanomi, ordered\nthe remains to be buried in Rose Bank Cemetery, and the\nmonument with the inscription quoted to be erected to her\nMemory.—Caledonian Mercury.—[Rose Bank Cemetery is\nin a suburb immediately to the south of Edinburgh.]\nA REMARKABLE MAN.—This city is now the home of one\nof the most remarkable men of the age—a man who has tra-\nversed the civilized globe, and established in almost every\ncountry which he has visited the sale of his medicines for the\nrelief of human suffering, and which are a certain cure for\ndisease in all its forms. We allude to Professor Thomas\nHolloway, of London. It is now several years since this\nbenefactor of the human race first proclaimed to the world,\nthrough the British press, that he had, after deep research, pre-\npared a remedy that was sure to eradicate disease. Years of\npatient investigation into the laws of human physiology which\ncontrol our bodies in health and when diseased, led to the in-\nvention and preparation of the world-renowned Holloway's\nPills and Ointment. Nearly, if not quite, one half of the\nhaman race have taken his medicines ! His name is as uni-\nversally known over the globe as that of Alexander, Napoleon,\nor Washington, when in the height of their ambitious career.\nIf they conquered nations on the field of battle, Professor\nHolloway has, with no weapon but that of science, conquered\ndisease in all its forms. His meritorious career is bounded\nby no imaginary lines of latitude and longitude short of those\nmarking the confines of civilization itself. No isolated country\nor nation was sufficiently extensive for the operation of his\nenterprising and gigantic intellect. Wherever disease has a\nresidence, there he has penetrated with his medicines, and left\nan enviable and enduring reputation. After enlightening\nEurope, his fame spread over Asia, and the civilized portions\nof Africa, and finally appeared in America. He has translated\nthe cures he has performed, and the virtues of his medicines,\ninto as many languages as the missionaries have the Bible.\nGOvernments, otherwise the most despotic, have been forced\nby the great value of his medicines, and their popularity with\nthe people, to remove antiquated and time-honored restrictions\nupon the introduction of foreign medicines, and open their\ncustom houses to a free introduction to the Pills and Oint-\nment, of this distuingished man. Empires and kingdoms\nremoved the barriers of ages against the introduction and sale\nof proprietary or patent medicines, and freely permitted Hollo-\nway's medicines to become the physician of the masses.—New\nYork Dispatch.\nTRIAL ROR MOBBING AND RIOTING.—At the High Court of\nJusticiary, Edinburgh, on Monday last, four young men were\nplaced at the bar charged with mobbing and rioting, and with\nassault and injury to property, at Greenock, on the of April\nlast, on which occasion a large mob assembled in front of the\nRoman Catholic Chapel there, beat in the doors with a large\nbeam. broke the windows with Avn., anti couunlited other\ndamage to the chapel, as well as to the school and the adjoin-\ning dwelling-houses of the priest and teacher. In sum-\nming up the evidence, the Lord Justice-General laid down\nthe law as to participating in or giving countenance to\nriotous acts. He said,—\&quot; All those who were in- the\nmob and who took an active part in it were guilty of\nthe whole proceedings of that mob generally. The jury\nreturned a verdict of guilty of mobbing and rioting against\nthe prisoners, but not of participating in the acts of\nassault and injury libelled, The Lord Justice-General, after\nstating that the Court were disposed, from extenuating\ncircumstances in each case, to treat the prisoners with leniency,\nsaid,—\&quot; You must not suppose that you are punished because\nof the particular object you had in view, as being connected\nwith any following out of the religious opinions which you\nyourselves entertain in opposition to those of the persons\nwhose property was to be sacrificed by these proceedings. It\nis not because you entertain particular opinions, or because\nwith zeal,\nthat we are going to\nris it because of any\nyproounmonanincetaian\nsentence\nopuipnoinyoin it\nparticular favour to the religious opinions of those whose\nproperty has been assailed. In this country all parties, all\nsubjects of the Queen, all who are residing within the range\nof the laws, are amenable to the laws, and entitled to the\nprotection which they afford. We know no distinction\nof religious parties in any question of this kind. In\nthis country all persons are entitled not only to enter-\ntain what religious opinions they please, but to profess\nthose opinions, and to worship according to their own\nfaith, whatever it may be. Be they Jews or Gentiles,\nPagans or Christians, Papists or Protestants, Episcopalians or\nPresbyterians, it is all the same. The law says that they have\na right to worship after their own fashion, and that law will\nprotect them in the exercise of this right. Therefore you must\n'not suppose, and no persons must suppose, that we enter into\nthe religious question here ; but while we hear rumours of\npersecutions for religious opinions in other countries, and are\ninclined to sympathize with the sufferers, and to feel indigna-\ntion at the conduct of the oppressors, it would be very wrong\nindeed if in this country which boasts of being a land of liberty,\nwhere persons are entitled to freedom of conscience without\nany restraint, except that which conscience itself imposes, any\nproceeding which involves violence against parties on account\nof their religious opinions should be permitted to go unpunished.\nWhile the law permits them to have liberty, those who\nadminister the law must take care that that liberty is pre-\nserved to them, and not abused by the strong. It is because\nyou have violated that law, and for no other reason, that we\nnow pronoun&amp; sentence of imprisonment upon you.\&quot; His\nLordship then sentenced three of the rioters to six, and one to ,\nthree months' imprisonment,\n\nMR.

From 1,200 to 1,500\nTurks from Silistria have passed the Danube in boats, and\nlanded at Kalarasch. Although the Turkish corps now in the\n-Dobrudscha are sufficiently provided .with bridge equipage,\nand is supported by a flotilla, and, although the coast of Bes-\nsarabia is only defended by about 10,000 Russians, yet it is\nnot expected that the Muchir Ismail Pasha has any present\nintention of attacking the Russians. He appears inclined to\nwait for the fall of Sebastopol, in which case he would doubt-\nless be supported by some allied troops. The greatest com-\nmercial activity prevails on the Lower Danube. It is calculated\nthat, since the opening of the navigation, more than 500\nvessels, of which 200 were Austrian, have taken on board\ncargoes at Ibrail and at Galatz.\&quot;\n. _\n\nflit LATE CAPTAIN Lroxs.—The enclosed extract from a\nletter from one of the officers of the Miranda may be interest-\ning to our readers:—\&quot; Tlaerapia, June 25.—Our brave Captain\nis no more.

The navy has lost its greatest\nornament ; and we have lost one who, to us, was more than a\nfriend. He was so brave, so great,' so good,'and so amiable,\nthat we all loved him much snore than we knew. We buried\nhim on Monday evening, the 26th of June, with all naval\nhonours. Crowds of people of high rank attended Isis funeral.\nThe head of our figurehead, Miranda, was shot away almost at\nthe same moment. that our dear captain received his death\nwound.\n\nFIRE AT ILITECIERFORD-MARKET.—On Sunday evening\nconsiderable alarm was caused in the vicinity of Hungerford-\nmarket, London, in consequence of a fire breaking out on the\nwharf of the market, occasioned by some boys accidentally\nemptying their pipes on a waggon laden with straw. On the\nsudden outbrezk messengers were despatched for the Chandos-\nstreet, Watling-street, West of England, and various other\nengines, which promptly arrived, and speedily got to work,\nwith a good supply of water from the mains of the New River.\nThe wind blowing strongly, the flames spread with amazing\nrapidity, and five carts and one waggon belonging to Mr. Mil-\nigan, hay and strawdealer opposite the booking-office, on the\nwharf, as well .e Mr. T. kiendersua'3 cavts; speedily ignited.\nThe firemen worked most strenuously, and by dint of great\nperseverance the flames were subdued, but not until the straw\nand carts were nearly destroyed.\n\nLORD Jorm Rus-sr.r.L.—Lord John Russell is no longer a\nmember of the Administration. In consequence of repre-\nsentations from some of the members of the Government in\nthe House of Commons as to the difficulty under which they\nlaboured with regard to the motion of Sir E. B. Lytton, his\nlordship came to the resolution of removing their embarrass-\nment by retiring from the Ministry. Accordingly, at his re-\nquest, Lord Palmerston yesterday acquainted the Queen with\nthe resolution to which Lord John had come, and her Majesty\nwas pleased to accept his resignation. No successor to Lord\nJohn Russell as Secretary of State for the Colonies has been\nappointed, but it is not improbable that one will be desig-\nnated for her Majesty's approval at the Cabinet Council to be\nheld this afternoon. We cannot, of course, speak with cer-\ntainty upon the subject, but we believe it is not unlikely that\nthe new Colonial Secretary will be taken from amongst the\npresent members of the Cabinet, and we apprehend that his\nfitness for the post will be at once recognized by the country\nand the colonies.—Globe, of Saturday.\nTHUNDERSTORM ON SATURDAY.—ShortIy after 6 o'clock\non Saturday morning, the metropolis was visited by a violent\nthunderstorm, which continued for nearly an hour. The\nlightning was of a vivid character. The rain fell in torrents,\nand many of the small streets at the east end of London were\nflooded for several hours. The market gardeners' grounds\nwere also inundated, and considerable damage was done by\nthe great fall of rain. At Bristol the storm took place an\nhour or two previously. It commenced about half-past three\no'clock, and exceeded in violence anything of the kind that\nhas occurred in that city for the last 30 years. The thunder\nwas very violent, and the lightning so vivid that the Captains\nof African and Indian ships in the port describe it as being\nthe nearest approach to a tropical tornado that they ever\nwitnessed in this country. Considerable damage was done by\nthe hail, which beat the wheat down in all the surrounding\ncountry, and broke thousands of panes of glass; and at St.\nGeorge's,Gloucestershire,the electric fluid struck a house near\nthe Don John's-cross, destroyed the chimneys, and split the\nhouse from the roof to the basement story.\n\nSUNDAY DISTITEBANCES IN LONDON. HYDE-RAIZ/K.—\nThe Sunday demonstrations in this park are unmistakably dying\nout, and in another week or two there will be no trace left of\nthe commotion. On Sunday the number of people assembled\nshowed a decided falling off, and the more respectable classes\nheld themselves carefully apart from the crowds of urchins\nand thieves who had collected. Of course, they did all in their\npower to get up a disturbance, rushing hither and thither,\nmaking as much noise as possible, and scurrying away as\nsoon as they came in collision with the police. Beyond a con-\nsiderable amount of pocket-picking very little mischief was\ndone, and the number of offenders taken into custody tended\npowerfully to check the disposition to riot. The police did not\nshow in the park itself, but at the different outlets and in the\nneighbourhood they were mustered- in ample force, while\na mounted patrol kept up with the quick movements of the\nmob, and prevented any serious injury to property being at-\ntempted. No carriages appeared in the drive, so that no fa-\ncilities existed for getting up a disturbance, and we may fairly\nhope that next Sunday afternoon the park will present its\nusual peaceable aspect. Two attempts were made by the\nrabble to penetrate into Belgravia from Albert-gate, but both\nwere promptly repulsed by the police, and the ringleaders ar-\nrested.\n\nSTATE OP THE MORMON COMMUNITY.—The Cambridge\n0h.•.,,,;,1. Rives a letter from Salt Lake City by a woman who\nbad embraced tile ‘l.lmign. and left that neiolbour-\nhood. The expose speaks for itseir\nand Mormonism in the old country are two entirely distinct\nsystems. You know not whom to trust; in fact, you are sus-\npicious of everybody, and everybody suspects you. Human\nlife is of no value here ; cutting throats is as carelessly talked\nof from the stand as clipping your finger-nails ; indeed, if they\nconsider you becoming at all disaffected to their principles, it\nis considered doing you a kindness to kill you, that your soul\nmay be saved. It is heresy to think of leaving the, society ;\nand should any make the attempt, every obstacle is thrown in\ntheir way. Scandal and lies the people fatten on. I would\ndefy the smallest village in the world to propagate the same\nwith more avidity than this people. A woman's character is\ntaken away by the slightest breadth ; you are at everybody's\nmercy, no matter how low, mean, or contemptible the party\nmay be ; and woe to you should your husband be on a mission!\nThey set husband' against wife : try to get the husband into\n'plurality; and women's hearts are as ruthlessly broken as a\npiece of straw by bending. Divorces can be readily obtained,\nfor from five to terrdollars ; and there exists not, I verily be-\nlieve, as I believe in a God, a more miserable, broken-hearted,\ncanwor\nwork\nUtah.

The United States\nsent out a detachment of men in the fall, ostensibly en route\nto California, but really to investigate the many crying atroci-\nties in this horrible place.

and, that\nshe was the \&quot; Church of .the Poor,\&quot; was once one of\nthe chief glories of the Church of England. This\ncharacter she earned by providing, through the\nbounty of her richer children, that in every parish in\nthe land the Gospel machinery should be brought\nhome to each man's door, and that its ministry to him\nshould not depend on his ability to pay for it. That\nthe sacred labourer is worthy of his hire, is certainly\na Christian principle ; but' not that his labours should\nbe placed on a level with secular employments, and\nthe pecuniary support of the labourer calculated as a\nquid pro quo for the value of his services.\nIt is impossible to travel through the parishes of\nEngland, without perceiving how strictly, •in theory,\nthe Church has acted upon this principle ; it is impos-\nsible to examine the lavish profuseness of her noble\necclesiastical foundations, without thankfully acknow-\nledging how well she has fulfilled her Lord's mission\n\nin this particular. The darker side of the picture,\nhowever, remains for us, and for days of \&quot; peculiar\nGospel enlightenment.\&quot; It is equally impossible to\n\nsee the parish churches, in their present desolation,\nor to walk through the districts of our towns, without\nbeing compelled to admit that the Church of England\nno longer in fact possesses this high character.\nWith regard to many of her finest parish churches,\ngiven to the poor by the pious liberality of our ances-\n\ntors, they have been taken from them, and placed at\n\nthe disposal of the richer classes, by the erection of\npews, guarded by doors and numbered as part of\na rented property, belonging, for all uses, to\nthe -person - rents them. In numberless\ncases, where the most liberal endowments have beep\nmade for the frequent performance of divine ser-\nvice, and the maintenance of a sufficient body of\nclergy, these endowments have been stolen for the\nbenefit of a lay impropriator, and barely enough left\nfor the support of a single minister, the assistance of\none of our charitable societies being necessary to\nmaintain a second. But these, we may say, were the\ncrimes of an earlier generation. Let us ask, what we\nare doing to extend the blessings of the unpurchased\nGospel through the unprovided districts of our towns ?\nKai, whatever we have done, or whatever we are\ndoing, this is confessed on all sides, that the Church\nhas not yet regained her hold upon the poor. Churches\nare rising around us, but they are not built for the\npoor. Eloquent proclamations of the Gospel ring in\nour ears on all sides, but the rich purchase them for\nthemselves. Each man pays for his religion as for\nany other luxury, or, if you will, necessity, of his life.,\nA preacher is \&quot; liked ;\&quot; a Church is built for him\nthat is, a permanent investment is made for his mainte-\nnance ; his admirers appropriate its sittings, and they\nthink their homage to religion has been paid. They\nrush in crowds to hang upon his accents, and think\nthey must be very earnest followers of the Gospel.\nThey listen, perhaps, to his denunciations of a corrupt\nreligion, and flatter themselves that they are cham-\npions for the purity of Christianity. They feed, or,\nthink they feed, from a plenteous table, and the pri-\nvilege of the poor is, that, perchance, they may gather\nup some of the crumbs which fall from the entertain-\nment of their betters. It is clear that popular reli-\ngion has not yet found out the way of carrying the\nGospel in its integrity to the poor.\n\n\&quot; The poor will not come to Church!\&quot; Granted.\nBut this is a strange complaint from you who do not\nbuild churches for the poor. This is a grave inconsis-\ntency in your mouths who absolutely refuse to have\nchurches built for the poor. This is but a vain lip\nlamentation from you who interfere with the inten-\ntions of earnest men with your miserable disputes and\nfactious accusations, while the poor perish around you,\nand who yourselves do not take up the work which\nyou prevent others from doing, because you disagree\nwith them on some point of doctrine or peculiarity of\nform.\n\nBut we may yet find opportunity to expound our\nidea of the causes of this fact which stares us in the\nface, viz., that the Church has lost her hold upon the\npoor ; and also of the remedies which the case demands.\nAt present we are pressed with one mode of remedy\nwhich has regained of late the prominence it had lost,\nand which has occupied much local attention during\nthe last few days.\n\nWe took occasion, some time since, to allude to the\nadvisability, in the \&quot; present distress,\&quot; of street preach-\ning, conducted with caution and judgment. And the\nphilosophy, if we may so employ the term, of street\npreaching, we appirhend to be this : that it should be\nused only as a preparation to the direct agency of the\nChurch. We must not have Christianity expounded\nat the corners of our streets and in the market place\nas a mere school of ethics, or system of doctrines\nwhich each man may adequately realise, and then be\nleft to himself. Street preaching is a mere endeavour\nto startle into inquiry the careless and profligate, to\nargue from their experience of some mysterious power\nof evil which tyrannises over their inner man, and\ncrushes every better aspiration to the need in which\nthey stand of a deliverance, to the importance of\nthe fact that a Deliverer has come upon earth,\nand that if they are willing they may be brought\nwithin the scope of that \&quot; Mighty power whereby He\nis able to subdue all things unto Himself.\&quot; If the\nexample of the Apostles be adduced for street preach-\ning, from the naked fact that they did preach in the\nhighways and thoroughfares, it must be followed to\ns issue. With them Christianity was not merely\nthe hearing and believing of certain doctrines, but the\ninduction into a community ; and of those who ac-\ncepted their teaching it was recorded that the LORD\nadded them to the Church, and that they continued\nsteadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship,\nand in the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers.\nv.,,aching, therefore, must not be adopted as a\nbuilding churches, and setting up the\nsubstitute\nfull machinery of the Gospel. It must be used as a\nmere check to the everyday course of blind wicked-\nness travelled by the besotted thousands who are\nperishing for lack of knowledge. It is not the remedy\nfor their ills, but it is to inform them of their need of\na remedy, and to induce them to turn aside from the\nway of their wickedness to the messenger whom\nCHRIST has commissioned on earth to lead their foot-\nsteps to the cross.\nIt was with this idea that, in our previous remarks\non the agency of street preaching, we recommended\nthis mode of its employment, namely, that a district\nshould be marked out and appropriated to a particular\npastor with his assistants ; and that these clergy\nshould undertake the public invitation of the people\ncommitted to their charge—that, having built up a\nliving Church, a school-room or temporary building\nhaving been used in the meanwhile, a material temple\nof the Lord should rise in their midst; built for them,\nperhaps partially built by them, made theirs, that\nthey might hereafter enjoy the blessings which they\nhad learnt amid many difficulties to feel their want of\nand to appreciate.\nwithout, therefore, arguing it on the ground of\necclesiastical order,---which, if there be such a thing as\norder, must be at\nonce decisive against one pastor's\npreaching in the parish\nof another without that\nother's consent,---it will be at once apparent what view\nwe take of the scheme set on foot by the Rev. Dr.\n111`1•Inux, of preaching on the Exchange Flags. If\nthe object of street preaching be what we have supposed,\nthat must be a very inadequate mode of conducting\nit, by which it is turned into a mere advertised attrac.\n\ntion for novelty-hunters and personal admirers. To\nselect a respectable area in the middle of the counting-\nhouses, and business resorts of the merchants and\nmiddle classes, and invite those who may choose for\nsome motive or other to come, is not carrying the\nGospel to the hovels of the poor. This is not going\n'out into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring-\ning in the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and\nblind ; it is not going. into_ the highwap and hedges,\nand compelling them to come in. Dr. 31`NEILE may\nsay that, without wishing his plan to be followed in\nevery respect, his intention is merely to make the\nPractice of open-air preaching respectable for his less\nknown brethren. But is the example of so pleasant a\nmode of its performance likely to incite them to\nthe endurance of its harsher and heavier inflictions ?\nWill they be induced ; by this display with a flourish of\ntrumpets, and a flattering audience drawn from all\nparts of the town, to plod on in unknown paths,\nwhere no admiring eye can cheer, where notoriety\ncannot tickle vanity, and excitement carries with it no\ncharm ? No. They will strive to escape the disa-\ngreeables of their duty ; and their work will fail through\na disregard of that great law alike of morals and of\nreligion, that no permanent good is ever done in this\nworld but through self-denial and suffering. Really,\nif the Rev. Doctor wishes to set an effective example,\nhe will in future confine himself to his own district ;\nand, giving him credit for the best intentions, we do\nnot think it necessary to say more at present on the\nsubject.\n\nFROM OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.\n\nMONDAY MORNING,\n\nTITB past has been a busy and a bustling week in all those\nplaces \&quot;where politicians most do congregate.\&quot; The Clubs\nhave exhibited an amount of commotion akin to that which\napiarists inform us takes place in a bee-hive, when the ento-\nmological republic, having become too hot to hold its members,\nis involved in the anarchy of a revolutionary movement which\nends only with thedeath or extrusion of one of the contending\nh-oits. The House of Commons has been convulsed in all its\npoints, the galleries and division lobbies sharing in the agita-\ntion ; nay more, the Council Chamber itself has once more\nbeen the scene of those amiable contentions which some\nmonths ago were of such frequent occurrence ; and which\nwere intimated to the outer world by the mysterious announce-\nment that \&quot; Ministers remained in close deliberation for up-\nwards of three hours.\&quot; A declaration which those pretending\nto be in the secret interpreted into a confession that Ministers\nhave been in hot and violent altercation for the time specified,\nand that in most cases it conveyed to the Ministerial hangers-on\nintelligence of a similarly pleasing character to that communi-\ncated to an anxious ship's crew, when, during the night, they\nare assailed by the sudden and alarming cry of \&quot;breakers a-head.\&quot;\nEvery one felt assured of an impending crisis, from the\nominous Parliamentary conclusion of the preceding week,\nwhich was wound up by the melancholy display of -Lord\nJoin. RUSSELL in his frequently enacted character of the\nDouble-dealer. Consequent on the discreditable disclosures\nmade by his Lordship in the House on the evening of Friday\nse'nnight, and which, besides the condemnation of friends and\nfoes in that august assembly, drew down upon his devoted\nhead the unmitigated indignation of the country, Sir E. B.\nLYTTON gave notice on Tuesday night of a motion to the\neffect, \&quot;That the conduct of the Minister charged with the\nnegotiations at Vienna, and his continuance in office as a\nresponsible adviser of the Crown, have shaken the confidence\nwhich the country should place in those to whom the adminis-\ntration of public affairs is entrusted.\&quot; The intimation of a\nmotion-so pointedly in unison with popular feeling, yet withal\nso temperately expressed, and so extensively sympathised in\nby the House of Commons, as well as by their constituents,\nwas the first thing which appears to have created alarm for the\nsafety of their places in the ministerial mind. To gain time\nfor a consideration of the defensible points of the position, was•\nthe first object clutched at—to secure the uncertain support of\nwaverers—and to enlist the Irish Brigade, or, as they delight\nto call themselves,the cohortof \&quot;fifty independent votes,\&quot; was\nthe next Move, and both of these \&quot;dodges\&quot; were played of\nwith a skill and hardihood which could only have been ac-\nquired by extensive and frequent practice. The motion is to\ndecide the important question whether the nation will tolerate\nthe continuance in office of a minister who entertains, or at\nleast professes a public and a private opinion, diametrically\nopposed to each other on so important a -point as the continu-\nance of war, or the conclusion of peace; and by implication\nwhether his colleagues, who were cognizant of these discre-\npant views, and continued to act in concert with him, are not\nas bad and as untrustworthy as he is. Such a motion is a\nmatter of no trivial moment. It broadly impugns the honour\nof one member, and touches nearly the reputation of all the\ncabinet ; and it is brought forward in no petulant spirit ; nor\nis it tabled by an, intriguer for place. A motion so pregnant\nwith consequences is one which no ministry can lie under and\nretain any function of utility. So long as the accusations it\nimplies are unrebutted, the moral influence of the Cabinet is\nannihilated ; and, under these circumstances, the course of\naction open to a man of spirit, or of a ministry which covetted\npower merely that it might serve the country, is to meet and\nif possible to disprove the accusations. To such a course of\nbehaviour the PALMERSTON administration makes no pretence.\nInstead of offering facilities for bringing the question to im-\nmediate issue, the PREMIER treats the subject with his cus-\ntomary levity, and when asked if it would be convenient\nto take the discussion on this very important motion on Fri-\nday, the day usually set apart for questions of supply, he an-\nswered snappishly that Friday was set apart for discussing\n\&quot; The New Partnerships Bill\&quot; and the \&quot; Limited Liability\nBill.\&quot; Two topics peculiarly apposite to the ricketty condition\nof the Cabinet, without doubt, but still not of a sufficiently\nimportant nature to take preference of one which, by its moral\ninfluence, paralysed the whole functions of Government at a\njuncture of the national affairs when united counsels and com-\nbined energies are indispensable to the safety of the State.\nThe unbecoming facetiousness of the noble PREMIER MS so\npointedly rebuked by Mr. DISRAELI, that for once Lord PAL-\nMERSTON was checked \&quot; dead up,\&quot; and with an assumed air\nof indifference he agreed to peril the existence of the Adminis-\ntration on the issue of the motion this evening. In the mean\ntime, however, all the manoeuvres of party tactics had been\npressed into the service of the impeached Ministry. Conces—\nsions had been made to a deputation of the \&quot;Brass Band,\&quot; by,\nwhich it was hoped to secure their aid in the event of a close-\ncontest. Other means also were not neglected, and rumours\nwere industriously circulated by and among the Ministerial\nunderlines to the effect that, like CURTIUS of old, Lord.\nJoan would plunge into the gulf which, unless propitiated\nby a sacrifice of that description, would assuredly swallow\nup the whole Cabinet. The magnanimity of the proposedsolf-\nimmolation was praised in his lordship's hearing, amidst strong\nexpressions of regret for the necessity of the sacrifice. Still\nhis lordship made no sign. Other hints were thrown out as\nto the necessity of providing a Cabinet JONAH, who by-being\nthrown overboard might still the raging waters which\nthreatened to engulf the ministerial barque. But still Lord\nRum gave small show of understanding ; and he who was so\nsensitively prompt with his resignation on a recent occasion,\nwhich merely threatened to unship his colleagues, cosid not be\nmade to budge when another set of colleagues would by his\n„c„es„,tion obtain a ulauxcU of rescue from impending ship.\nwreck. More desperate expedients were resorted to, expedients\nof so disreputable a kind as hardly to meet with. belief. In\nreference to the position in which he was placed, the Daily\nNews says ;—\&quot; He was ready to stand the- brunt of the\nthreatened assault and to abide the consequences. Not so the.\nmen by whom he had been surrounded. Seared at the sound'\nof the rising storm of popular indignation), and solicitous only\nfor the retention of power—men who six weeks ago were\nready to acquiesce without hesitation in the proposal of com-\npromise with Russia suggested by Coant,Buox, have not been\nashamed to join in forcing Lord JonN to tender his resignation\nto the head of the government. Through every rank and grade\nof the party, efforts have been made to further this design. The\npride of the SECRETARY for the Cowsius having been stung\ninto making the offer we have mentioned, resort was had to\nthe respectable and high•spirited device of a round robin\naddressed to Lord PALMERSTON, urging him to accept the\nresignation. This document was actually hawked about the\nprecincts and passages of the House of Commons during the\nsitting of the House, yesterday (Thursday), and while the\ntwo noble lords continued to occupy their usual seats, side\nby side, up= the-Treasury bench. We are unwilling to state\nhow many names of men calling themselves Whigs are\nappended to it ; but, we believe, we may venture to say, that\nthe rebukes which its authors encountered from the manly\nand independent members who refused to act a part fit only\nfor sailors in a mutiny on shipboard, served to convince them\nthat their clumsy device is one too shameless even for the\npresent House of Commons.\&quot; The reader who cons over the\nabove, and reflects on some of the recent moves of Lord\nJoint himself, will be involuntarily impelled to put the Whig\nparty in the position of SITYLOCK, and make it, in the language\nof that worthy, exclaim to his lordship, \&quot; The villany you\nteach me I will execute ; and it shall go hard but I will\nbetter the instruction,\&quot; Whether they made so plain a\ndeclaration or not,. they seem to have acted on the maxim.\nThey do- not, -however, appear to have perilled their case\nentirely on those means of accomplishing their purpose, strong\nand disreputable as those means were. The Times says\n\n`1 The members of the government in the House of Commons\n\nnot included in the Cabinet, represented by Mr. BouvEnn,\n\nare reported to have informed him (Lord JOHN RUSSELL)\nthat they were not prepared to vote against Sir BuLvrEc.\nLYTTON'S motion.\&quot; The Times adds, \&quot; This removed all\ndoubt as to the result of the impending division.\&quot; It left\npoor Lord Josn no alternative but to \&quot; adjust his mantle ere\nhe fell,\&quot; with the best grace he might ; and he resigned. The\npreceding delineations of Whig perfidy and meanness are\ndrawn by \&quot; liberal\&quot; 'artists, and. froin'their knowledge of the\nmen, and also of the Jacts referredio, the_picture, however\nhumiliating and repulsive, is entitled to belief.\nOf late Lord.Jourr RUSSELL has become somewhat noto-\nrious.for th,e nature,\n.the freedom, and the. peculiar fashion of\nhis explanations. Another scene, it is to be hoped the last one'\nyet awaits him as an expository commentator on the sayings\nand doings of his quondam colleagues. The eloquent phil-\nfipple he delivered on the occasion of dismissing Lord PAL .\nMERSTON from the Foreign Secretaryship, which that noble-\nman held under his lordship, is too recent to have been for-\ngotten, or to require repetition; he may, however, and in all\nprobability will, indulge in a few supplementary strokes just\nto complete the portrait, and as it were bring it down to the\npresent day. His able performances in the portraiture of the\n\nEarl of ABERDEEN and the Duke of NEWCASTLE will scarcely\n\nrequire either repetition or retouching to render them crack\nspecimens of delineative, if not very friendly, art ; but, when\nhe comes to fill in the portraits of Mr. BOUVERIE and that\nhonourable gentleman's coadjutors, something racy, as well as\nspirited, may be reasonably anticipated. His tour de force,\nhowever, will, in all likelihood, be reserved for finishing the\nhigh-minded devisers of the \&quot;round robin,\&quot; or which the radical\nscribe of the Daily News represents most unfairly as \&quot; fit\nonly for sailors in a mutiny on shipboard.\&quot; No human con-\nstitution, however, is equal to the tasks in this line to which\nhis lordship subjects himself, and even the amateur vigour of\nvoluntary performances of the kind referred to have a\ndebilitating effect on the performer; and to this condition\nof humanity Lord Jonx RUSSELL forms no exception.\nThis fact was made painfully manifest on Friday evening,\n\nwhen he essayed an answer to a question put by Mr.\nDISRAELI, on the preceding night, when Lord Jou was not\nin the House. It had been currently reported during the day\nthat the answer would be given, and at six o'clock, when the\nsitting commenced, every thing gave indication of an ex-\npected statement of importance. The body of the house was\ncrowded by members; in the Peers' Gallery there was a con-\nsiderable gathering of peers, including the Earl of ALBE-\nmARLE, Lord Wrifroan, and Lord CAMPBELL; and every\neye was fixed on the spot occupied by the expected orator.\nAfter one disappointment, the audience were so far gratified\nby his Lordship addressing himself to the task in hand,—the\nexpected explanation. The display was anything but a\npleasing or exciting one. He was evidently out of spirits and\nout of humour. He spoke in a tone of voice indicative of ex-\ntreme dejection, and so low as to be scarcely audible. His\nspeech, which was but a brief one, produced but little' effect,\nand was heard very imperfectly. He reiterated his statement\nthat he considered the Austrian proposals might at the time\nhave been accepted with advantage. The statement fell upon\nlistless and incredulous ears; and when he came to the aver-\nment that he thought they could not now be adopted with\npropriety—and that consequently he was for a vigorous\nprosecution of the war, his declaration was received with\ncontumelious laughter ; even his own friends of the old Whig\nparty Smiling scornfully at the attempted double. That very\npure tribe now affect to view what he thought and they ad-\nmitted to be strokes of profound cunning, as childish indica-\ntions of weakness and deceit which never imposed upon any\none. They profess now to say that by his last false. move\nhe has rudely destroyed all faith in his capacity as a states-\nman ; and what is more, that he has destroyed all confidence\nin his sincerity and truthfulness as a man—that lie has corn.\nmitted political suicide. So complete a political and moral\nprostration has seldom fallen to the lot of any individual who\nheld a prominent place in the national eye.\n\nIn the meantime, the result of Sir E. B. LYTTON'S, motion\nis anxiously canvassed in the political circles of all parties.\nOn the part of the Government out-and-out supporters-, it is\nsaid that, by a skilful application of his carefully-studied tac-\ntics,—and now that he has got rid of Lord JOHN, as' a kind\nof \&quot; Old Man of the Sea,\&quot; who rode upon and galled the neck\nof his administration,—LordPAlMEßSTON will defeat the mo-\ntion by a considerable majority. On the other hand, they\nmaintain that, if hard run on a division, or even if beaten, he\nwill not resign, but have recourse to a dissolution,- appealing\nto- the country on his determination to prosecute the. war\nwith' vigour and alacrity. Many individuals, however, and\nthe parties who have probable means of knowing, declare\nthat the whole Government must go with Lord Jour RE'S--\nSELL ; that the country is heartily-sick of one and all of them,\nand will admit of no compromise in getting rid of them. A\nfew,-who profess to know exactly how the matter rests; will\nhave it that the Conservative party have the game entirely' in\ntheir own hands. These individuals maintain that an. influ-\nential deputation of the Conservative party left Lonibm im-\nmediately on its being known that the PALMERSTON Cabinet\nhad, resolved to eject Lord Jourr, and that that deputation\nproceeded directly to Knowsley, to consult with the Earl of\nDERBY; who received them most kindly and entered =into\ntheir views with alacrity. A prevalent statement among.the\npromulgators of the list-mentioned rumour is to the effect\nthat a strong 'Conservative Government will be immediately\nformed, among the first of whose proceedings will be auappeal\nto the constituencies:- Whatever shall come out of' it, the\nWhigs- seem disposed to put their house in order, afar as\nthey are able, and to provide apartments, if possible,. for the\nmore-necessitous and clamorous of their friends. On Friday\na report obtained confident circulation in Lincoln's-Inn;. that\nChief Justice JERVISi' of the Common-Pleas, will immediately\nresign his seat, and be succeeded by Sir A. COCICRVEN? Lord\nPaLarzaSTON'S Attorney‘General.\n\nAs on similar previous occasions, everything has giTen:pace,\nin the public mind, to a consideration of the government\ndead-lock. Even the war itself, out of which all the contre-\ntemps of recent occurrence have direetlyor indirectly sprang,\nhas for the instant ceased to occupy the chief place in general\nattention. Still the morsels of intelligence which come fre-\nquently, although in no instance fraught with mush informa-\ntion, or made the bearers of very important results,. are never-\ntheless so far satisfactory that, while detailing no great or\nstartling achievement, they are destitute of evil tidings, and\nare on the whole favourable to our ultimate suceesa. The\nattacking works of the English have been pushed, with suc-\ncess, considerably nearer the Redan ;. one account- states that\nthe cemetery so gallantly taken by our troops on.the 18th of\nlast month, and so unaccountably resigned after having been\nheld for fourteen hours, was re-occupied by our men on the\nfollowing day, and still remais- in our possession. In the\nmeantime, Prone various sources,information is received repre-\nsenting the state of the Russian army as very deplorable, and.\ntheir losses, in the way of transmitting reinforcements to the.\nCrimea, as gigantic and overwhelming. Our new commander.\nin-chief appears to be labouring on, undismayed by difficulties\nor opposition, both of which he appears to disregard. The\nhealth of our troops is represented as in all respects satisfac-\ntory on the whole, and everything appears,to wear the air of\napproaching success. As regards the proceedings of General\nPELISSIEMi opinion seems divided in the Crimea and in Paris,\nas in some degree in this country. In most respects he is\nregarded, as a brilliant and dashing soldier who has no\nidea of fear, and . some say too little of consequences=--such\na general, indeed, as, would lead a brave army through\nany amount of obstacles and opposition in the field, and as\none in every respect equal to any emergency which can be\naneeamifolly npposaci_by indomit.tia_will. and oveveonae by the\nmoat uncompromising activity, and the most daring enter-\nprise. While such is the prevalent opinion respecting his\ngeneral merits and qualifications, military critics, and espe-\ncially in France, where they are both numerous and accute,\nconcur in representing him as impetuous and rash, and as a\nman not well fitted for the conduct of such an enterprise as\nthe reduction of a fortress like Sebastopol. In confirmation\nof this theory, they point to numerous instances, in which\nthey maintain that the successes he has achieved in the\nCrimea are not equal to the sacrifices at which they have been\nattained ; and, as an irrefragable evidence of the accuracy of\nthese views, they point with melancholy significance to the\nsad tissue of blunders which commenced, accompanied, and\nconcluded the desperate conflict of the 18th of June. One• of\nthese gentlemen, in speaking on the subject of Paaissixn's\nqualifications, delivers himself as follows :—\&quot; The rapidity and\ndecision of the French Generalissirao's movements are pro-\nverbial. ' Take me that battery, though it cost twenty lives,'\nhe says, and the troops rush to the exploit. The battery is\nnot taken, but forty lives are sacrificed. Well, then, try it\nagain at the expense of two hundred.' Four hundred fall !\nStill the feat is not accomplished. Let the whole army go to\nit—we must have it at any cost.' \&quot; Although these strictures\nare, probably, over-severe, they are, unquestionably, so\nfar countenanced by facts ; and men of calm judgment, as\nwell as the most intrepid bravery, question sharply the tac-\ntical wisdom which, commencing an attack with inadequate\nmeans, is compelled to repeat it with quadruple or octuple the\nforte. The failure, in the first place, they say, is attended with\na totally useless expenditure of means, and a depressing waste\n' of life ; and they maintain that even the ultimate success so\nachieved is diminished in value by the loss of prestige which\nattended the repulse.\nFrom the Baltic the intelligence received at the end of last\nweek, though not very decisive, is on the whole more en-\ncouraging. The destruction of a town in Finland, on the sth\ninstant, bears testimony to the active exertions of our fleet in\nthese hyperborean regions ; and the receipt of a despatch from\nAdmiral DIINDA.S, in which he communicates an account of a\ndiscussion with the Russian authorities relative to the privi-\nleges of flags of truce, indicates still more strongly the desire\n\nof our enemies to depart as far as possible from the usages of\ncivilized war. •\n\nWhile war and political changes have agitated the great\nworld, it is pleasing to observe that these Matters have not\nentirely absorbed the general attention ; but that, on the con-\ntrary, elevated rank, breaking through the trammels of con-\nventional etiquette, and combining with humbler talent, has\nlent a grace to seasonable benevolence. During the past week\nprivate theatricals, for charitable objects, have occupied an in-\nteresting position in the fashionable world. The drama,_ for\nthe nonce, forsaking the play-house, has been naturalised in\nthe mansions of the nobility ; and the sock and buskin have\nbeen adjuncts to the furnishings of the drawing-room. On\nTuesday afternoon a private theatrical entertainment was\ngiven at Grosvenor House, the proceeds of which were devoted\nto help the suffering poor; and on the evening of the same\nday, a dramatic entertainment, attended with the most entire\nsuccess, was given at Campden House, under the management\nof Mr. CusuLas DICKENS, for the benefit of the Consumption\nHospital. On Friday, the gallery of Bridgewater House was\nkindly set apart by the Earl and Countess of ELLESMERE, for\nthe performance of some dramatic entertainments, the pro-\nceeds to go in aid of the Hospital for Convalescents at Walton-\non-Thames, the funds of which institution have suffered severe\ndilapidation through the failure of &amp;MAHAN, PAUL, and .Co.\nIn each of the three instances the benevolent effort@ were\ncrowned with gratifying success. The ordinary theatrical\nworld is wagging pretty much as usual. At the Haymarket,\nMiss PAIICIT has made her first appearance before a London\naudience in Mr. THEODORE MARTIN'S charming translation\nof \&quot; King Ren6's Daughter,\&quot; and has, as might have been ex-\npected, from the genuine beauty of the drama, and the parti-\ncular excellence of the lady's acting in it, produced a great\nsensation. It is not a little singular that, although Miss\nFAIICIT has frequently enacted the chief character in this\npiece with distinguished success in the provinces, she should\nnot, till the other night, have adventured it before the London\ncritics. At the St. James Theatre, the celebrated tragedienne\nItacnpr, is to appear in several of her leading characters in the\nplays of Les Horaces, Phedre, and Andromaque, commencing\non the evening of this day fortnight. On the conclusion of\nher engagement, she will proceed to Liverpool, whence she is\nto embark for America.\n\nIn the publishing world some little stir has been created by\nthe appearance of \&quot;A Vindication of Major-General the Earl\nof LDCAN from Lord RAGLAN'S Reflections on his Conduct in\nthe Action at Balaklava,\&quot; which has been issued by HATCH-\nARD. In this version of the case some new points in favour\nof Lord LtrcA.N have been well put, indeed, clearly esta-\nblished ; particularly as it appears Lord RAGLAN changed the\narrangements previously made between Sir COLIN CAMPBELL\nand Lord LucAri, whereby the command of the cavalry was\nvirtually taken out of his lordship's hands. I was glad to\nperceive you recently made honourable mention of the Law\nBook of the season, Blackstone's Commentaries by WARREN.\nBy the profession it is looked on as of standard excellence,\nand both amateurs and professional-men will find it of inesti-\nmable value at the period of a general election,. which most\nparties appear to consider imminent. An unusually large\nimpression of it (3,000) for a law book, has been, thrown off;\nand the demand for it continues large and steady. I perceive\nthe John Bull speaks very favourably of it. The Pori' LAu-\nBEA:TB and Mr. FESTIIS BAILEY both announce new poems in\nthe press,- the of that by the latter to be entitled \&quot; The\nMystic.\&quot; It is described as being very magnificent in its\nimagety, and powerful in the postic style of its diction.\nOther minstrels of less sonorous lyre are also, it is understood,\nhatching•poetic broods, and, before thesere leaf of autumn,has\nbeen shed, it is probable we shall be favoured with a consider-\nable lock of APOLLO'S` fledglings.\n\nTHE REY, DR. 3P.NEILE, AFL► STREET\nPREACHING.\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.\n\nStn,—l want this after:lcon to hear the Re-.- Dr. M'lsTeile\npreach, as hebad announced' his intention of doing, on the\narea in front of the Exchange; and it occurred to me, on re:\nturning, that r would commit Tfew thoughts to paper, for the\nchance of your deeming them worthy of insertion in your\njournal. I think I may claim to be an impartial witness,\ninasmuch as the mooted point of street preaching was one\nfreely discussed by the clergy of a town with which, I was\n'connected before I came to Liverpool; and some of my\nbrethren and myself had almost resolved upon trying the\nexperiment before I-left. I- am not about, then, to.eater a\nwholesale protest against the practice, which seems-to be\nsanctioned, at least, if 'not recommended, in that part;of the\nparable of the \&quot;great- supper,\&quot; in which the master of the\nhouse is represented as saying to his servant \&quot;Go out into\nthe streets and lanes of the city, * * into the high ways\nand hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may\nbe filled; —and which certainly 111 a: claim i-cry high precedent,\nas having been the constant habit of Christ and his Apostles.,\nThe questions which I wish- to solve are—Lst : How far was\nthe place; occupied by the Rev. Doctor this day, adapted for\ncarrying ,out the practice-F-2nd : To what proportion of Ids\nauditors was his address likely •to prove-edifying or profitable?.\nI own, knowing the strength of lungs and power of elocution\nundoubtedly possessed by the Preacher, Lwas not prepared for\nthe difikulty, which, (in common with myself,) must have been\nexperienced-by at least two-thirds of the congregated mass who\nwere really anxious to hear what he had to, say. I gradually\n`mike:buy way from the outskirts of the-multitude, to within\ntwenty yards,- or less, directly in front of, the platform on\nwhich, the- Rev. Doctor was-standing ; and even at that short\ndistanced could only hear a few isolated words. at intervals in\neach sentence. The people- about me, after rain •efforts• to\npenetrate the dense phalanx which had acquired -a nearer\nposition, were restlessly flitting about, cr hl very audible,\nmurmurs expressing their- inability to bear thus rendering-\nthat inability still more complete, both to themselves mato\ntheir neighbours. Meanwhile, the confused sounds from.\nbehind proved that vast numbers were on: the spot, on the-\nmost aharitabie hypothe6s, from mere curiosity, without any\nwish, even, to hear a message from God, through the voice\nof Ilia ambassador.\n\nThe inferences which I drew were these.: The place is\&quot; •too\nlarge—the crowd, in numbers, is too unmanageable—and,., if\nthe phy*eai powers of Dr. Nl'Neile are-unable to surmount\nthese obstacles, no one else need attempt.to do so.\nStreet preaching, if it is to do any good, must have a\nlocal aim. It must not endeavour to draw together masses\nfrom various parts of a large town, in a space calculated to\naccommodate a great multitude ; but it: must be practised in\nthose particular streets, courts, or alleys, in which, without\n'obstruction of public thoroughfares, the preacher may have\nfull evereand over the audience which he has to • address,\narrest their attention, and, by the blessing of the Holy Spirit\nreach their hearts. Public advertisements, ..I re.ature to'\nthink, will not effect this. The street Preacher, I humbly\nsubmit, should, by personal visitation, make known, in the\nlocality in which he means to preach, his intention of doing\nso; and should take all proper means :to prevent its being\nknown generally. He may reasonably expect to receive a\ndeferential attention from, those whom he has personally in-\nvited; but, I cannot help thinking, where general publicity\nhas been given, the number of idlers or curioas persons, who,\nwill congregate together, will altogether thwart the good in,\ntentions of thepreacher, and result in evil rather than good.\nI say, result in,evil; for a crowd, in itself,unless under bene-\nficial control, iedisposed for mischief. Thievesand adulterers\nwill, perhaps invariably, mingle with it ; and assuredly a crowd,\nthe principal part of which cannot possibly come under the\nbeneficial influence which is supposed to preside over it, will\nfail to derive any profit from its concentration, and will\nalmost certainly give occasion for the commission of much sin.\nHence, I say, if we are to have street preaching,, let us not\naim at a popular demonstration. Let us remember that labour,\ndiligence, and perseverance, are, ordinarily, as necessary to\ninsure success in our profession—that of the Christian minis-\ntry—as in any other ;—that we are not to look for miraculous\nagencies in this age, but for a blessing in proportion to the\nself-denying exertions which we personally make to secure the\nend which we have in view ; and that, while preaching is a\nmighty engine for good to those who are really brought under\nits influence, this class will consist,—not of those who idly\ncongregate from motives of curiosity, or worse motives still,—\nbut of those, 'for the most part, who, either from education,\nhabit,or personal contact with God's ministers, have been\ninduced to become hearers of the Word.\n\nI inclose my card for your own information ; but I have a\nstrong repugnance to controversy, and do not mean to enter\n\ninto it.\n\nShould you insert this letter, and should it elicit a reply, I\nhave no Intention of making a rejoinder. I would only say\nwith St. Paul, \&quot; Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice,\nyea and will rejoice.\&quot;—l am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nSunday Night, July 15,1855. D.

Never !\nLORD JOHN RUSSELL'S EXPLANATIONS.\nOn the motion that the order of the day be postponed, for\nthe purpose of proceeding with Sir E. B. Lytton's motion,\nLORD J. RUSSELL rose and said, that on Thursday last he\nhad stated to Lord Palmerston that he wished to retire from\noffice, and he had to state that Her Majesty had been pleased\nto accept his resignation, and he now held office only until\nhis successor was appointed. He then entered at great length\ninto an account of his proceedings at ,Vienna, and upon his\nreturn, observing that it was true he had promised to lay\nbefore the Government in the most favourable manner the\npropositions that had been made to him by Austria. He i\ndid so :in conjunction with other persons of great weight and\nauthority, and acted in conjunction with the Ministers of Fo-\nreign Affairs for France and Turkey. He brought this proposal\nto this country upon the 29th of April. On the 30th, a Cabinet\nCouncil was held, the result of which was that the propositions\nnot adopted by Her Majesty's Government. He then justi-\nfied his conduct in recommending the adoption of these pro-\npositions, stating that the rejection of them did not alter his\nopinion of their merits; and replied to Mr. Disraeli's objections,\nthat if they were received, there was no great issue at stake\nto justify the exertions which this country was making to\ncarry on the war. It was because the war was necessary that\nthese exertions should be made, and he was the bearer\nchioautedghtthtehmeyagwneitruedaetoftthhaet\nperil to Turkey; he conceived the power of the project of\ntoifmteh\nfite ptio.o\nbe\neo sai\nRussia to be such that it was necessary, if possible, to combine\ntcicoenpstedb.ecallusee appreciated\nall the great powers of Europe against her, in order that peace\nmight be secured. Such was the foundation of his opinions—\nnot formed suddenly upon the merits of the proposition ; but\nwhen Lord Westmoreland wrote, on the 16th May, a despatch\nstating that the Austrian Government conceived they had\nfulfilled the conditions of the treaty of December 2nd, and\nthat they would not make the refusal of Russia to accept the\nproposition a casus belli, but only a ground for breaking off\nthe Conferences. When the government received that de-\nspatch, tllere was no doubt, on their part, that it was not\nworth their while to go into Conference to support a prove-\nsition of the kind there stated? which was less favourable to\n\nthe Allies than that proposed by M. Drouyn de Lhuys, which\nit was nearly certain, Russia would reject, and which Austria\nwould not go to war to support. From that time, therefore,\nthere was altogether an end to negociations with Austria\nfor the purpose of proposing an ultimatum to Russia,,\nand that the war must be continued in order to\nmaintain the obeets of the Allies. It had been made a-\nreproach to him by Mr. Disraeli and others, that though he\nhad been the bearer of the Austrian propositions, he had\nspoken in favour of a vigourous prosecution of the war. He\ncould not see what else he could possibly do. The govern-\nment had determined that the negotiations must be put an\nend to, and what other means were there left for obtaining\nfor a solution to the third point. The government were\nquite right in not making a communication to the house of\nthe Austrian propositions at that time. The decision of\nAustria not to interfere by force nor to move her armies upon\nRussian trritory, but on the contrary to withdraw from any\nparticipation in the the contest, and even\&quot; to diminish and..\nreduce here froces having been taken, it was evident from that\nmoment that Russia which had been threatened, and has felt\nlgpressure of the great increase of the Austrian army, feel-\nWhat preessure taken off, would immediately feel herself\nat liberty to detatch some of the best troops in her army to\nthe shores of the Crimea, to oppose the armies of Great Britain\nand France, render these circumstances, it would have been\nmost unjustifiable for the government to have stated prema-\nturely the decision of Austria not to propose an ultimatum to\nRussia. He could not conceive a greater dereliction of duty in\nsuch acase. The noble lord further defended his opinion in this\nrespect, adding that the government were united in the course\nthat had been taken. He further stated that when Mr. Gib-\nson brought forward his question last Friday, after all that\nhad then occurred, he should have been totally unworthy of\nhis opinion if he had shrunk from meeting it with the expla-\nnation which he then made. What else could he do than own\nand admit the part he had taken in these transactions, He\nshould have been ashamed of himself if he had denied that\nwhich he had done, and that whieh was his conscientious\nopinion. The hon. baronet (Sir E. Lytton) thought that the\ncourse he had taken was a ground for want of confidence in\nthe whole Administration, and he was of opinion that because\nhe (Lord J. Russell) held these views in May, he was incapable\nof serving Her Majesty. Now that impression appeared to\npreuail generally, and he consequently thought it necessary to-\ntender his resignation. Lord Palmerston having taken this\ncourse, he did not feel at all discontented with the position in\nwhich he found himself. He saw no reason to do so. He had\nalways acted from what he believed to be for the benefit of the\ncountry. He had turned over this question again and again\nwith a view to the public interest. He had advised that\nwhich he thought expedient for the eountry, and, whatever\nmight happen, he had the satisfaction of having acted accord.\ning to his conscience-\nSIR E. B. LYTTON'S MOTION.\n\nSir E. B. LYTTON then rose and said that, in bringing for.\nward his resolution he hoped the house would be as indulgent\nto him as they had been to the noble lord, placed as he was\nunder the necessity of bringing forward a motioe against a\ngovernment which, but for the conduct of one of its members,\nwas entitled to their indulgence and commpassion. He then\nproceeded to criticies the noble lord's speech, who, he said, as\na member of the government, had called upon the country to\nspill its best blood in a war which he, as a negotiator, believed\nunnecessary. Adverting to the Vienna correspondence, he\nexpressed surprise that the noble lord had not retired from\nthe cabinet within a week after he returned. It was surpris-\ning that the noble lord at the head of the government had not\nseen that his government could not go on while its members\nwere so completely divided in opinion, as was apparent from\nthe correspondence that the Secretaay for the Colonies and the\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs were wholly at variance on the\nquestion of counterpoise. He (Sir. E. B. Lytton) gave a hearty\nconcurrence to the sound and healthy tone of Lord Claren-\ndon's correspondence, but how could Lord Palmerstone think\nof going on when he contrasted the opinions of that nobleman\nwith those of Lord J. Russell. Was Lord Clarendon to be\nconsidered the specimen of the Cabinet? Were they all\nunited—were the first Lord of the Admiralty and the Chan-\ncellor of the Exchequer in unison with the rest of the Cabinet\nin carrying on the war ? The Cabinet was said to be united\nlast May, yet it was now admitted that there were differences\nof opinion ; and he would remark that a discussion like this\nwould scarcely be excused by the plea of expediency. He\nwould withdraw his motion, for all its objects had been at-\ntained.\n\nMr. BOUVERIE said that, as the motion had vanished into\nthin air, he would offer a few words upon a subject personal\nto himself. He had seen a statement that he was one of some\nmembers of the government who had waited upon Lord Pal-\nmerston, to say that they could not resist the motion of the\nhon. baaonet. The very reverse of that statement was the\ntruth. The fact was, that he had refused to be a party to\nsuch a representation, upon the distinct ground of his personal\nattachment to Lord J. Russell ; but he stated that, as a friend\nof the noble lord, he was ready, however painful it might be,\nto convey to him the general impression among his colleagues.\nIn this he thought he was acting as a true friend of the\nnoble lord—(a laugh)—and he was satisfied that his noble\nfriend fully appreciated the motives which led him to take\nsuch a step.

Some misapprehension appears\nto have prevailed in reference to a sortie made by the\nRussian garrison on the morning of that day, at a very\nearly hour, and which, according to some reports, is\nsaid to have precipitated the French attack on the\nMalakhoff, and so to have led to the disasters which\nattended that attack. The discussions on this subject\nhave not tended in any great degree to clear up the\npoint, which is now of less moment. According to\nthe latest accounts received, the progress of the Allies\nin their measured advance upon the defences of the\ntown have not been materially retarded by the reverses\nreferred to. On the contrary, they seem to be pro-\nceeding with renewed energy ; and, if we may judge\nfrom the accounts transmitted, with a degree of su\ncess which augurs ultimate and not distant triump\nOn Saturday, the 23rd of June, the allied position and\nits neighbourhood was visited by a thunderstorm of ,\ngreat severity, accompanied by a very heavy fall of\nrain, which did a great deal of injury. All reports\nconcur in representing the health of the Allies as good.\nConcerning the thunderstorm and the general state\nof affairs,the Times correspondent, writing on the 25th,\nsays:\n\nThe storm which burst over the south-eastern portion of\nthe Chersonese on Saturday night has done more damage than\nwe could have anticipated. Men were drowned in ravines\nconverted by the tornado into watercourses, were carried off\nroads by mountain torrents, and dashed against hill sides ;\nbeasts were swept away into the harbour and borne to sea;\nhuts were broken up and floated into the ocean ; the burial-\ngrounds near Balaklava were swept bare, and disclosed their\ngrim army of the dead in ghastly resurrection, washed into\nstrange shapes from out their shallow graves ; and, greatest\ncalamity of all, the railway was in various places decomposed,\nripped up and broken down, so as to be unserviceable at our\ngreatest need. Orders have been sent down to urge on the\nnecessary repairs, for the demands of the batteries for shot and\nshell are pressing, and the electric telegraph has been repeatedly\nin use to-day to force on the attention of the authorities at\nBalaklava the necessity there is for their promptest exertions,\nand to order them to send up supplies of materriel\nfor our fifth bombardment as speedily as possible The\nFrench say they are quite ready, and they have\nreceived from us 1,500 32-pound shot for their guns\nto-day. The railway fails at a critical period, but even\nif it were in its usual state we could not hope to be in a con-\ndition to begin a heavy fire for some time to come, and I\nbelieve it will be fully a fortnight or three weeks before the\nnecessary supplies will be brought up to the front. The\nrepairs to the railway will be effected in ten days. Mr. Beatty\nand Mr. Campbell are away at Heraclea surveying the coal\ndistrict, but their representatives are men of energy, and the\nonly obstructions to be dreaded will arise from the \&quot; navvies,\&quot;\nsome of whom have been behaving very badly lately. They\nnearly all \&quot; struck work\&quot; a short time back, on the plea that\nthey were not properly rationed or paid, or that, in other words,\nthey were starved and cheated ; but the provost-marshal brought\nsome of them to a sense of their situation, and, indeed, the\noffice of that active and worthy person and of his myrmidon\nsergeants has been by no means a sinecure between \&quot; navvies,\&quot;\nGreeks, and scoundrels, of all sorts. The Croat insurrection is\nsuppressed, but the Croat idleness has not been by any means\nstimulated into usefulness. No wonder Col. M'Murdo finds it\ndifficult to get men for the Land Transport Corps, although\neven he is obliged to pay 2s. 6d. and 3s. a-day to native surid-\njees, so completely have we ruined the market. The losses in\nthe Land Transport Corps by death would be extraordinary\ndid we not find a parallel to them in the •Sardinian army of\nTchorgoun, which has lost in three weeks nearly 1,000 men by\ncholera, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The Turks and French en-\ncamped in the valley suffer somewhat from the same diseases,\nbut it is observable that the men who die are recruits and old\nmen who are mostly unacclimatized. To understand the diffi-\nculties in the way of what is called at home \&quot; taking the field,\&quot;\none must come out and stay out here. It would be much easier\nto take Sebastopol thanto take the field. There are only three ac-\ncessible passes, up the precipitous wall of rock which rises on\nthe north side of the Tchernaya, to the plateau on which the\nRussians are encamped, and the precipice runs round to the\nBelbek. These passes are so steep that an army would have\nsome difficulty in ascending them at its leisure, without re-\nsistance from any enemy. But they are occupied wherever\nengineering eyes detect the smallest weakness—they are com-\nmanded by batteries, intersected by positions threatened by\neverhanging cliffs all ready for the lever. March round and\nturn them ! Where and how ! We have no transport even\nif we could march, and we cannot march, because Napoleon\nhimself would never lead an army into such defiles as guards\nthe Russian position. Whether we are not strong enough to\ndetach a great corps of 40,000 or 50,000 men to operate\nagainst the Russians north of Sebastopol is not for me to\nsay; but it is certain that the base of operations for any such\ncorps must be the sea, till ample transport is provided. The\nCrimea is to all intents and purports a desert—a Sahara,\nwaterless and foodless before an invading army. A long train\nof provisions came into Sebastopol to-day, and the mirror tele-\ngraph, which works by flashes from a mound over the Belbeck,\nwas exceedingly busy all the forenoon. Troops were also ob-\nserved in motion on the hills opposite Inkerman. The weather\nis warm, but there is a strong breeze of wind, which tempers\nits heat. The rain has developed horrible effluvia in camp,\nand sickness is rather on the increase. With great regret and\nsurprise we heard of Captain Lyons's death this evening.\nTHE ARMISTICE.\n\nConcerning the armistice, the same correspondent,\nwriting on the 26th, says :\n\nThe sad history of the 19th, which 1 was obliged to inter-\nrupt on the departure of the mail, is soon finished. The bodies\nof many a brave officer whom I knew in old times—old times\nof the war, for men's lives are short here, and the events of a\nlife are compressed into a few hours—were borne past us in\nsilence, and now and then, wonderful to relate, men with severe\nwounds were still living, and able to give expression to their\nsufferings by moans and sighs of pain. The spirit of some of\nthese noble fellows triumphed over all their bodily agonies.\n\&quot; General !\&quot; exclaimed a sergeant of the 18th Royal Irish to\nBrigadier Eyre, as he came near the place. in the cemetery\nwhere the poor fellow lay with both his legs broken by a round\nshot; \&quot; thank God, we did our work, any way. Had I another\npair of legs, the country and you would be welcome to them !\&quot;\nMany men in hospital, after losing leg or arm, said they \&quot;would\nnot have cared if they had only beaten the Russians.\&quot; The tor-\ntures endured by the wounded were very great ; they lay in\nholes made by shells, and were frequently fired at by the Rus-\nsian riflemen when they rolled about in their misery. Some of\nour men, however, report that the enemy treated them kindly,\nand even brought them water out of the embrasures. They\npulled all the bodies of our officers which lay within reach up\nto the abattis, and took off their epaulettes, when they had\nany, and their boots, but did not strip them. It was observed\nthat the ditch of the abattis was in excellent order—that the\nchevaux-de-frise had been repaired, and were very strong, and\nthat every effort had been used up to the moment before we\nassaulted to render it, as it was, a formidahle obstacle to our\nadvance. It is said that the bottom of the ditch was filled\nwith bayonets, fixed firmly in the earth; and there is a report\nthat the Russians were employed during the night of the 17th\nin repairing the abattis itself where it was injured by our\ncannon. I have already tried to describe the nature of the\nground in the front of the abattis. It was in itself a con-\nsiderable impediment to regularity of formation. A line of\nsentries was formed by the Russians as our burying parties\ncame out, and they advanced so far in front of the abattis that\nGeneral Airey was obliged to ;remonstrate with an aide-de-\ncamp of General Osten-Sacken, who ordered them to retire\nnearer to the abattis. It was observed that these men were fine\ntall, muscular, and soldierlike fellows. They were unusually\nwell dressed, in clean new uniforms, and were no doubt picked\nout to impose upon us. Many of them wore medals, and seemed\nveteran soldiers. Their officers had also turned out with unusal\ncare, and wore white kid gloves, patent leather boots, and white\nlinen. The mass of the Russians were gathered on the\ntowering parapets of the Redan and Malakhoff, and were not\npermitted to come to the front. Their working parties\nbrought out all our dead, and laid them in front of their line\nof sentries, whence our people carried them away. The\nprecautions which had been taken to prevent officers and men\ngetting through the lines sufficed to keep any crowd away,\nbut the officers on duty and the lucky men, and some\namateurs, who managed to get through the lines, formed\ngroups in front of the Redan, and entered into con-\nversation with a few of the Russian officers. There was,\nhowever, more reserve and gravity in the interview than has\nbeen the case on former occasions of the kind. One stout\nelderly Russian of rank asked one of our officers \&quot; How are\nyou off for food ?\&quot; \&quot; Oh ! we get everything we want ; our\nfleet secures that.\&quot; \&quot; Yes,\&quot; remarked the Russian, with a\nknowing wink, \&quot;yes ; but there's one thing you're not so\nwell off for, and your fleet can't supply you, and that's\nsleep.\&quot; \&quot; We're at least as well off for that as you are,\&quot; was\nthe rejoinder. Another officer, in the coarse of conversation,\nasked if we really thought, after our experience of the de-\nfence they could make, that we could take Sebastopol. \&quot; We\nmust ; France and England are determined to take it.\&quot; \&quot; Ah !\nwell,\&quot; said the other, \&quot; Russia is determined France\nand England shall not have it, and we'll see who has\nthe strongest will, and can lose most men.\&quot; In the\nmidst of these brief interviews, beginning and ending\nwith bows and salutes, and inaugurated by the concession\nof favours relating to cigars and lights, the soldiers bore\ndead bodies by, consigning the privates to the burial grounds\nnear the trenches, and carrying off the wounded and the\nbodies of the officers to the camp. Poor Forman's body was\none of the first found ; it was far in advance of where he came\nout of the trench with his company of the Rifle Brigade, and\nit was terribly torn with shot. It was generally observed by\nsome of the surgeons, however, that the wounds were cleaner\nthan they have been in previous engagements. This is some-\nwhat remarkable, for the Russians fired all kinds of missiles—\nbags of nails and fragments of bullets, shells, and balls, as\nwell as grape\n. and canister. They were seen as we advanced\n\&quot; shovelling\&quot; the shot into the muzzles of the guns. No\none can deny many of the officers the praise of extreme\nbravery and devotion. In the midst of our fire they got up\noil the top and on the outside of the parapets, and directed\nthe fire of their men upon us. Several of them were knocked\nover by round shot, shell, and rifle balls, while exposing them-\nselves in this manner, but it scarcely speaks well for their\nsoldiers that they felt it necessary to set them such examples.\nColonel Dickson succeeded in obtaining Lord Raglan's per-\nmission to open on the Russians from the 21-gun battery, and\nswept them away in numbers as they crowded out to fire on\nour broken columns and on our wounded men and fugitives.\nThe armistice lasted for upwards of two hours, and when it\nwas over we retired from the spot so moistened with our\nblood.\nRETENTION OP THE CEMETERY.\nAll the advantage we gained by the assault was the capture\nof the Cemetery, and even that we had nearly abandoned,\nowing to the timidity of\nthe\neof our generals. As you have\nalready learnt, the men in Cemetery and houses suffered\nseverely during the\n18th t om. the enemy's fire, and the\nsoldiers in the latter were not able to withdraw till nightfall.\nIt was left to one of the Generals of Division to say what\nshould be done with the Cemetery, and he gave orders to\nabandon it. On the following morning an officer of Engineers,\nLieutenant Donnelly, heard to his extreme surprise that the\nposition for which we had paid so dearly was not in our\npossession. Re appreciated ita value—he saw that the\n\nRussians bad not yet advanced to re-occupy it. With the\nutmost zeal and energy he set to work among the officers in\nthe trenches, and begged and borrowed some 30 men with\nwhom he crept down into the Cemetery, just before the flag\nof truce was hoisted. As soon as the armistice began the\nRussians flocked down to the Cemetery, which they supposed\nto be undefended, but to their great surprise they found our 30\nmen posted there as sentries, who warned them back, and in the\nevening the party was strengthened, and we are now construct-\ning most valuable works and batteries there, in spite of a heavy\nfire, which occasions us considerable loss. Such is the storythat\nis going the round of the camp. Lord Raglan is said to have\nfound fault with General Eyre for -losing SO many men, but\nthe latter observed, that he had done what he was .ordered,\nand that he had taken the Cemetery. There can be no doubt\nbut that our troops could have got into the town in the rear\nof the Redan from the houses on the 18th, had they been\nstrong enough to advance from the Cemetery. Whether they\ncould have maintained themselves there under the fire of forts,\nships, and batteries, is another question. It is now shrewdly\nsuspected that inside the Redan, behind those outward and\nvisible walls of earth, there is another very strong work—a\nkind of star fort of earth with sunken batteries—and it is\ncertain that inside the Malakoff works there are several lines\nof battery which have never been unmasked. The enemy\nhave probably constructed large funnel-shaped pits behind\nthese works, into which shells roll and burst, as such a \&quot; dodge\&quot;\nwas found in the Mamelon. Inside the latter work were\nsplendid bombproofs for the men to retire into when our fire\nbecame hot. They were large pits with 10 feet of earth, and\nbeams of wood across them, and were capable of holding a\nstrong body of men. In one some new sacks marked with\nthe broad arrow and B. 0. were found, in which were packets\nof cartridges ready for use. Where did these sacks come\nfrom P It is almost as strange as the English bread found at\nTchorgoun. There is talk of a spy being taken, or rather\ndiscovered, in a sub-interpreter to the Commissariat, who\nconfesses he has been in communication with the Russians,\nand revealed our attack to them. He will be shot, if this be\ntrue.\n&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;British Library Heritage Made Digital Newspapers&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Liverpool Standard and General Commercial Advertiser.&quot;},&quot;location&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liverpool, Merseyside, England&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1855-07-17T00:00:00&quot;},&quot;item_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE&quot;},&quot;word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:55,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;55&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_mean&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9031,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.9031&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_sd&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1419,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.1419&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;LIVERPOOL TO SLIGO.\n\nROSE Wednesday..

After considerable dis-\ncussion, the different clauses of the bill were disposed of, and on\nthe proposal of Sir B. HALL, some new clauses were agreed to\nwithout discussion.—On the motion of Mr. HORSPALL, a clause\nwas adopted which provides that, on the certificate of the\nmedical officer to the local authority that any house was over-\ncrowded, proceedings might be taken to abate such overcrowd-\ning.—The house then resumed, and the Chairman reported the\nbill to the house.\nMr. HOLLAND took the oaths and his seat for the borough\nof Evesham, in the room of Mr. C. G. Berkeley, who had ac-\ncepted the lailtern Hundreds.\n\nThe house adjOi;ned at four o'clock.\nThe evening sitting commenced at six o'clock. After the\ndiscussion of some matters of routine, comprising a few re-\nmarks on the Turkish Loan, the subject of\nTHE AUSTRIAN PROPOSALS and Sir E. B. Lytton's motion\nregarding Lord John Russell's share in the negotiations for\npeace were introduced by Lord PALMERSTON, who brought up\nPapers connected with the late negotiations at Vienna, and in\nmoving that they be laid on the table observed that the go-\nvernment could not consent to the motion of which notice had\nbeen given by Mr. Disraeli (to give precedence that day to Sir\nB. B. Lytton's motion over the orders of the day), since the\nPapers he had then presented could not be in the hands of\nmembers in time for the discussion.—Lord J. RUSSELL, refer-\nring to an inquiry made by Mr. Disraeli in his absence on\nTuesday, explained what he did say did not require the sanc-\ntion of Her Majesty, which had, however, since been given.—\nMr. DISRAELI did not see that the statement of Lord John\nat all changed the state of things. What had disquieted\nthe country was, that it should have come out on his\npart that he had returned to England with a project of pacifi-\ncation of which he approved, and which he recommended\nto his colleagues, and, on their refusal to adopt it, he had\ncome down to the house, and made a speech which conveyed\nto the country that he was an uncompromising advocate of\nthe war, leaving an impression upon Parliament and the\nnation utterly inconsistent with the facts. If he received an\nassurance that there should be a full discussion of this im-\nportant issue on Monday, he would not press his motion.—\nLord PALMERSTON said his object in deferring the discussion\nwas to give time for the papers to be read ; and, if it suited\nthe convenience of Sir B. Lytton, he should be prepared to\ntake the discussion, from which the government had no wish\nto shrink, on Monday.—Sir E. B. LYTTON assented to this\nproposal.\n\nMx. ROEBVCX'S MOTION. —ln answer to a questions fir.\n\nROEBUCK said he believed that he should meet the wishes of\nthe house by postponing his motion.\n\nI Lord PALMERSTON, in reply to Mr. Hutt, said the papers\ndid not include a copy of the circular of Count Buol, which was\nnot in the possession of the government. The motion was\nagreed to.\n\n-The Education (Scotland) Bill was passed on a division by\na majority of 130 to 115.\nA protracted discussson ensued in regard to a deputation of\nIrish members on the Tenants' Improvement Compensation\nDisRAELr complained of the way in which the busi-\nness of the house was conducted.—Lord PALMERSTON disputed\nthe accuracy of the charge.—This subject led to a long discus-\nsion, in which no small degree of acrimony mingled, suggestions\nbeing thrown out that the intercourse between the Irish depu-\ntation and the Government was not altogether unconnected\nwith the impending motion of Sir B. Lytton.—At a quarter\nto one o'clock, the Chairman was ordered to report progress,\nthough none whatever had been made in the bill. •\n\nLady Raglan and Lord Raglan's AnnUitie; Bill passed\nthrough committee.\nThe Coal Mines Inspection Bill was read a third time, and\nafter some discussion passed.\nThe remaining business having been disposed of, the House\nadjourned at a quarter to 2 o'clock.\n&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;British Library Heritage Made Digital Newspapers&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Liverpool Standard and General Commercial Advertiser.&quot;},&quot;location&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liverpool, Merseyside, England&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1855-07-17T00:00:00&quot;},&quot;item_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE&quot;},&quot;word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:762,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;762&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_mean&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.947,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.947&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_sd&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1184,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.1184&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;OFFICIAL DESPATCHES.\n\nThe following despatches from General Simpson will be read\nwith more interest on account of their being the first he has\ntransmitted since he assumed the chief command, than in con-\nsequence of the actual information conveyed by them :--\nBEFORE SEBASTOPOL, June 30.\nMy Lord,—lt is with the deepest regret that I announce to\nyour Lordship the death of Field-Marshal Lord Raglan,\nG.C.8., which melancholy event took place a little before nine\no'clock on the evening of Thursday last, the 28th instant ; his\nLordship expired without any suffering in the midst of the\nofficers composing his personal staff.\nI have further to report that, being the next senior officer\npresent, I have assumed the command of this army until\ninstructions shall arrive from England.—l have, &amp;c.,\nJAMES SIMPSON, Lieut.-General Commanding.\nThe Lord Panmure, &amp;c.\n\nCHESTER AND HOLYHEAD RAILWAY.—The traffic for the\nweek ending July 1, 1865, was as follows :—Passengers,\nparcels, &amp;c., £3,646 17s. 2d.

He requested to know what\ncourse government intended to pursue in the matter.—The\nEarl of CLARENDON said the letter referred to was most\nunsatisfactory, and added that Admiral Dundas had been\nordered to demand the immediate release of the prisoners.\nA communication had also been made, through the Danish\ngovernment, on the subject, with the Russians. Till answtrs\nto these demands had been received, government could not say\nwhat course it would adopt.—Lord CAMPBELL said there\ncould be no doubt that the Russians had been guilty of a\nmost flagrant breach of the law of nations.—Lord COLCHESTER,\nwithout offering any excuse for the Russians, expressed a\nhope that this event would render our naval officers more\ncareful in communicating with the enemy by flags of truce.\nIn answer to a question from the Earl of Malmesbury, Lord\nCLARENDON said there were grounds for hoping that a cartel\nfor the exchange of prisoners will speedily be arranged.\nThe Victoria Government Bill was read a second time.\nTHE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.—The Marquis of CLAN-\nRICARDE moved for a return of all persons employed in the\ndiplomatic service, and expressed an opinion that the attacks\nso frequently made on that branch of the public service were\nunfair and unfounded.—The Earl of CLARENDON had no ob-\njection to the production of the returns.—Lord GRANVILLE\ntook the occasion to defend himself from some attacks which\nhad been made upon him in the Lower House with regard to\ncertain diplomatic appointments made by him when Foreign\nMinister.—Lord MALMESBURY deprecated any attempt to\nremove the patronage of the Foreign-office from the control of\nthe Foreign Minister for the time being.—The returns were\nthen agreed to, and the matter dropped.\nSome other business was despatched, after which their\nlordships adjourned.\n\n_\nTHURSDAY.\nTheir lordships had only a short sitting, in the course\nof which they forwarded several bills a stage.—ln the early\npart of the sitting, Lord LYNDHURST withdrew his Oath of\nAbjuration Bill.\n&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;British Library Heritage Made Digital Newspapers&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Liverpool Standard and General Commercial Advertiser.&quot;},&quot;location&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liverpool, Merseyside, England&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1855-07-17T00:00:00&quot;},&quot;item_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE&quot;},&quot;word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:358,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;358&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_mean&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9122,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.9122&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_sd&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1362,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.1362&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;FRIDAY, JULY 13.—Wind N.N.W., light.\n\nARRlVED.—Julianna Louisa, Spark, from Corunna —Jessie,\nSpillane, San Sebastian—Wm.

From\nthe moment she figures in the pages of this book, the\nreader becomes familiar with an improved tone in the\nmorals and a purer air in the narrative. That both\nGeorge 111. and his Queen were of simple and unos-\ntentatious habits, is too well known to require authen-\ntication ; and it is also known that both of them\nevinced considerable partiality for the sect of Quakers,\nwhose simplicity of manners seemed akin to their own;\nbut it may not be so extensively familiar to our readers\nthat, among the first visits of the youthful Queen\nCharlotte, accompanied by her royal husband, on their\nvisits to London, was one to the house of a Quaker ;\nnevertheless, so it was. After passing, as Dr. Doran\ngraphically delineates them, the various city formalities\nat Temple Bar and St. Paul's Churchyard, the royal\npair proceeded, not to Guildhall, but to the house of\nRobert Barclay, patent medicine vendor, ancestor to the\nhead of the firm of Barclay, Perkins, and Co. Robert,\nwho was in his eightieth year; was the only surviving\nson of that Robert Barclay who wrote the celebrated\n\&quot; Apology for the Quakers,\&quot; and who was also a pro-\ngenitor of the famous Captain Barclay, the noted pe-\ndestrian and zealous patron of athletic sports. The\noccasion of the royal visit to the city was a \&quot;Lord\nlifayor;slpa,P,:: and- the -prefercnce apcorded to-- the\n.Qtt,akers,Transion appears haie been higklappre-\nciaed\&quot;by' \&quot;'the hearty old man,\&quot; -who had keviously\nenterlained.both- the preceding Georges, and also' by\nhis family. Of this. fact Dr. Doran gives interesting\ntestimony in the following\n\nACCOUNT OF A ROYAL VISIT, BIC A QUAKERR3B.\n\nQueen Charlotte and George 111, were the last of our sove-\nreigns who thus honoured a Lord Mayor's show. And as it\nwas the last oceasion, and that the young Queen Charlotte was\nthe heroine of the day, the opportunity may be profited by to\nshow how the royal lady looked and bore herself in the estima-\ntion of one of the Miss Barclays, whose letter descriptive of\nthe scene appeared about forty-seven years subiequently, in\n1803. The following extracts are very much to our purpose\n:\n\&quot;About one o'clock papa and mama, with sister Western, to\nattend them, took their stand at 'the street-door, where my\ntwo brothers had long been to receive the nobility, more\nthan a hundred •of whom were then waiting in the ware-\nhouse. As the royal family came, they were conducted into\none of the counting-houses, which was transformed into a very\npretty parlour. At half-past two their majesties came, which\nwas two hours later than they had intended. On the second\npair of stairs was placed our own company, about forty. in\nnumber, the chief of whom were of the Puritan order, and all\nin their orthodox habits. Next to the drawing-room doors\nwere placed our own selves, I mean papa's children, none else,\nto the great mortification of visitors, being allowed to enter :-\nfor as kissing the- king's hand without' kneeling was an un-\nexampled honour, the king confined that privilege to our own\nfamily, as a retiirn'for, the trouble we had been-at. After the\nroyal pair had shown themselves at the balcony, we were all\nintroduced, and you may believe, at that juncture, we felt 'no\nsmall palpitations. The king met us at the danr, (a condel-\ncension I did not eipect,) at which place he saluted us with\ngreat politeness. Advancing to the upper -end of the room,\nwe kissed the queen's hand, at the sight of whom we were all\nin raptures, not only front the brilliancy of her appearance,\nWhich was pleasing beyond description, but being througheut\nher whole person possessed of that inexpressible something\nthat is beyond a set of features, and equally claims our atten-\ntion. To be sure, she has not a fine face, but a most agreeable\ncountenance, and is vastly genteel, with an air, notwithstanding\nher being a little woman, truly majestic; and I really think,\nby her manner is expressed. that complacency of disposition\nwhich is truly amiable ; and though I could, never perceive\nthat she deviated from that dignity which belongs to a crowned\nhead, yet on the most trifling occasions she displayed all that\neasy behaviour that negligence can bestow.l Her hair, which\nis of alight colour, hung in what is called coronation-ringlets,\nencircled in a band of diamonds, so beautiful in themselves, and\nso prettily disposed, as will admit of no description. Her\nclothes, which were as rich as gold, silver, and silk could make\nthem, was a suit from which fell a train supported by a little\npage in scarlet and silver. The lustre of her stomacher was\ninconceivable. The king I think a very personable man. All\nthe princes followed the king's example in complimenting each\nof us with a kiss. The queen was up stairs three times, and\n&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;British Library Heritage Made Digital Newspapers&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Liverpool Standard and General Commercial Advertiser.&quot;},&quot;location&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liverpool, Merseyside, England&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1855-07-17T00:00:00&quot;},&quot;item_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE&quot;},&quot;word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:858,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;858&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_mean&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.9086,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.9086&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_sd&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1562,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.1562&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TIDE TABLE\n\nDAYS. 1 JIOax..EVEIIO.j HOHT.I HOLYDAYS,ETC\n-.........-,—...-.--...-.\nJuly h. nl.

It\nis, indeed, difficult to believe that any officer, however fire-new\nhis dignity, could expect to brave public opinion by converting\nthe day of sacred rest into a day of infamy and torture, after\nthe well remembered explosion of popular indignation at a\nsimilar outrage, some few years ago, in the Seventh Light\nDragoons.--Evening\n&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;British Library Heritage Made Digital Newspapers&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Liverpool Standard and General Commercial Advertiser.&quot;},&quot;location&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Liverpool, Merseyside, England&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1855-07-17T00:00:00&quot;},&quot;item_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE&quot;},&quot;word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:134,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;134&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_mean&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.959,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.959&quot;},&quot;ocr_quality_sd&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0682,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.0682&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TO EMPLOYERS.\n\nWNICHOL begs to direct attention to his\n• AGENCY, as affording superior facilities for securing\nthe services of suitable assistants, while it relieves employers\nfrom the painful task of dealing with numbers of incompetent\napplicants.\nW.

Tuz SUNDAY 'BEER BILL.—The Select Committee on the
Sunday Beer Bill •met on Tuesday, when ,several London
magistrates were examined, all of whom objected to the bill
in its present shape, and advised important alterations.
Teas ease of Strahan, Paul, and Bates was again heard at
Bow-street Police-offiee, on Wednesday, when the prisoners
were further remanded for another week. Application for
bail was made, but refused.

DECIMAL COlNAGE.—Government, says the Times, are
stated to have resolved upon appointing a commission to in-
quire into the subject of decimal coinage, to be,ccmposed of
Lord Monteagle, hfr. -Hubbard, and Mr. Norman.

Mr. RIISSE'LL -GURNEY and Mr. O'Malley have given their
opinion that under the act 52 Geo. 111. cap. 166, =embers of
the Church of England, as well as dissenters, may protect
themselves from penalties by registering their housos as places
of religious worship, in compliance with the terms of -the act.
MRS. ISABELLA SPRAINGER, wife of Mr. M. Sprainger, of
Ramsey, Isle of Man, and who had been residing for some
time past with her sister at Laxey, committed suicide, on
Monday last, by suspending herself from a beam in the bed-
room.

EDIT TUE STAFFORDSHIRE SESSIONS, last week, a man and
woman were charged with stealing £7O from a horse dealer
at a fair at Leek. The man, who was acquitted, had been in
gaol sixteen times within ten years ; and the woman, who
was sentenced to fourteen years' penal servitude, had been in
prison eight times.
A COLLISION occurred on Tuesday evening, near the Rose-
grave station of the East Lancashire Railway, and a short
distance from Burnley, occasioned by a passenger train from
Accrington to Colne running into a goods train. The van of
the luggage train and a waggon, loaded with iron, were smashed
to pieces, but no serious personal injury was sustained.
FATAL QUARREL IN AN AaIEBICAN SHIP AT BALACLAVA.
—From a letter received from Balaclava, on the 26th ult., we
learn that a tragedy, attended with fatal results, occurred on
board the American ship Arlington. One of the men, in an
altercation with the mate, struck him, when the latter armed
himself: ith a pistol, and discharged its contents into the
chest of the unfortunate man. This wanton abuse of power
occurred at an anchorage where there were upwards of fifty
sail to render assistance in case of mutiny.
FEARFUL THUNDERSTORM.—On Tuesday afternoon Not-
tingham and the immediate neighbourhood were visited by a
terrible thunderstorm, which lasted for nearly three hours,
raging during that time with remarkable violence. The rain
fell in torrents, accompanied by hailstones of a very large
size. The storm commenced about three o'clock, and con-
tinued, with very little intermission, until six. In Bilbie-
street, and in other parts of the town walls were washed down,
and considerable damage done. A great amount of damage
has been sustained in the fields contiguous to the river Trent,
by the loss of stock, &amp;c. There has not been so great a fall
of rain for some time past.
ORDER OF AFFILIATION ON A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST.
—The County Justices in Quarter Sessions were on Wednes-
day occupied at Durham in hearing an appeal made by the
Rev. Richard Singleton, a Roman Catholic priest, against an
order made against him by the borough magistrates of that
town for the support of an illegitimate child. The mother is
Miss Beatrice Jane Jones, the daughter of a Church of Eng.
land clergyman residing at Douglas, Isle of Man. Various
proceedings have taken place in the case, but the result of the
investigation on Wednesday was that the county magistrates
confirmed the previous order, directing Mr. Singleton to pay
2s. ed. per week during 13 years for the maintenance of the
child.
A STATEMENT has been issued by Mr. James Low, from
which it appears that the shipments of specie from England
to India, China, Egypt, and Malta for the half year just
ended have been £2,614,006, of which, £396,847 consisted of
gold, and £2,117,169 of silver. As compared with the cor-
responding half of 1864, this shows an increase of £140,992,
although the total export was then unusually large. The
proportion of gold, however, is smaller in the present return.
The sum inclUded in the aggregate total as having been sent
to China this half year is £833,466, of which all but £140,524
was silver. In the first six months of 1864 the total sent to
China was £1,289,548. The recent augmentation in the ship-
ments to the East, has, therefore, been caused exclusively by
the Indian demand.
NEWSPAPERS FOR THE BRITISH COLONIES AND FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.—The following notice has been issued from the
General Post-office :—" Many newspapers for British colonies
and foreign countries having been posted unpaid,. contrary to
the Printed Instructions, No. 45,1855, recently issued upon
the subject, the Postmaster-General thinks it necessary to
repeat the intimation that a postage (the amount of which
can be ascertained by an inspection of the notice No. 45, at
any post-office) is now required to be pre-paid, in addition to
the newspaper stamp, upon all newspapers sent to the British
Colonies, and upon those sent to all foreign countries except
the following, namely,—France or Algeria, Belgium Prussia
rid Belgium, and any foreign country (except Turkey) rid
Belgium and Prussia, New Granada, Peru. Any newspapers
which may be posted without the requisite pre-payment, can-
not be forwarded to their destination,"

ceased, at Lancaster.
GRAIN TRADE IN THE DANUBE.—Letters from Constanti-
nople to the 28th of June report the arrival there, during the
preceding five days, from Brailow and Galatz of as many as
91 cargoes of grain, and the departure for those and other
Danubian ports, to load similar cargoes, of 'no less than 53
other vessels. !V
EVESHAM ELECTION: AUNIVERSAL REPRESENTATIVE.—
The nomination took place on Wednesday at the Town-hall ;
Mr. Holland was the only candidate, the two others having
previouslyretired. Mr. Holland was declared duly elected. In
returning
.thanks he said he was for a vigorous prosecution of
the war, and not only of the war, but of everything right and
just, whether at home or abroad. He was not a member for
any particular class of politicians, but for every class, for every
elector, and every non-elector,
DISTRESSING OCCURRENCE.—Two young ladies, the daugh-
ters of J. H. Rees, Esq., of Carmarthen, were bathing, on
Saturday, on the shore, near their father's house, when, having
ventured too far, they sank in a pool about ten feet in depth.
Their governess, who was with them, rushed to their rescue,
and, failing to save, died with them. Mr. Rees was hastily
summoned from a meeting which he was attending at the
church, and on coining out, the first objects which met his
gaze were the lifelessbodies of his children and governess, which
were being borne along to his house.
REPRESENTATION OF THE CITY'.—We understand that a
movement is now being made, with the view of gettieg up a
requisition, calling on Lord John Russell and Baron Rothschild
to resign their seats for the city. The, ground on which Lord
John is to be called on to resign is, that he grossly misrepre-
sents the sentiments of his constituents on the question of the
war ; while the reason which is to be urged for the resignation
of the Baron, is, that he does not represent them at. all.
There is, we are assured, a large and influential party
,in the
city, who are determined that it shall be hereafter efficiently
represented in the House of Commons.—Advertiser.
EXTRAORDINARY ESCAPE OF THE CREW OF A STEAIiTUG
AT SHIELDS.—The Welsh, a tug steamer belonging to Sun-
derland, brought a foreign schooner into Shields from sea on
Tuesday, and after seeing her moored, the master of the
steamer went on board the schooner to get his towage. He
had not been on board the schooner above a minute, and the
other two men belonging to her were standing forward in the
steamer, when her boiler exploded with fearful violence.
In an instant it blew everything in the cabin to pieces, and
forced out the stern and after deck. The boat immediately
sank, but, strange to say, the two men were rescued without
having sustained the least injury. The steamer has since been
raised, and it is found that her engine is all twisted and de-
stroyed.__
THOSE who have implicit faith in the universal " honour
of the English Tradesman," and a fortiori of " the British
Banker," may be surprised to hear a story which is current in
'commercial circles, and is as well authenticated as it is gene-
rally believed. A highly-respected London banker, on his
death-bed, called his.children round him, and asked them if
they believed in his reputed wealth ? They answered that
they shared the general opinion as to his large fortune, and
he then surprised them by the assurance that he had been
insolvent for the last thirty years. He, however, entreated
them not to be depressed by the intelligence; but recom-
mended them to go to Doctor's Commons immediately after
his decease and swear his property under half a million. The
advice was taken. The customers of the house were agreeably
edified on hearing of the enormous wealth of the late partner,
and the bank was firmer than ever, in the opinion of those
who trusted their money to its keeping.
THE STOLEN £5OO -NOTE.—A communication has been
received from one of the jury who were supposed to.have given
a verdict for the plaintiff in the Court of Common Pleas, at
Guildhall, on Tuesday last, in an action brought on behalf of
M. St. Paul, a moneychanger in Paris, against the- Bank -of
England, to recover a £5OO bank note, forming one of those
stolen from Messrs. Brown; Shipley, and Co., to the effect that
the jury-.did not intend to express, and had by no means arrived
at a conclusion favourable to the right of the plaintiff. The
feelingof a large portion of them, at least, is stated to have
been that M. St. Paul, having received notice of the robbery,
and liming wilfully disregarded it, or, at all events, having
adopted no steps to give effect to it, could not be considered to
have-taken the-note-hostel fide. The question is one of so much
moment as to make it important that the law should not be
settled on a misunderstanding of the intention of the jury,
and 'hence it is deemed -essential that their views Should be
ascertained on the point more clearly than appears to have
been possible in the hurried manner in which their verdict
was taken.— Timer.

POLICY OF PnrssrA.—According to the Berlin correspond-
ent of the Times, the opinion prevalent in that capital is
"that the Prussian Royal Family and the Court are bound
hand and foot, and sold body and soul to Russia." He adds :
" The before-mentioned view is based on the fact of a Prussian
Princess being the consort of the Emperor of Russia who was
reigning at the time of this conflict being brought about by
him, on the very strong presumption of there being a power-
ful party at Court here imbued with Russian sympathies, and
the patent factthat Prussia has not openly and actively joined
ua in the struggle against Russia. The three facts are cor-
rect, but the_imputed cause of Prussia's policy is incorrect;
there are so many perfectly valid reasons, military, financial,
political, and economical, to withhold Prussia from taking a
forward part in the war, however convinced King, Ministers,
and people may be of the necessity of profiting.by the present
opportunity of •asserting the independence of the country; that
we have no need to suppose feelings of brotherly affection on
the part of the King, or political sympathies for Russia on the
part of certain members of the Court, to have been more than
subordinate accessories in determining the course that Prussia
"has hitherto:taken."
ANECDOTE or THE QUEEN.—A few days ago, in the
beautiful little cemetery of Rose Bank, our attention was
directed to a handsome monument of Aberdeen granite,
having the following inscription in letters of geld:—" Sacred
to tno memory of Miss Ida Deno.uorai, tine foltlAful
esteemed dresser of Queen Victoria, who departed this life
October 15, 1804, in the thirty-seventh year, of her age, be-
loved and respected by all who knew her. This stone has
been placed' by Queen Victoria as a mark of her regard." On
inquiry we found that one day, whether in the autumn of
1.-864 or at a former period we were not told, when Miss Be-
nanomi was accompanying Queen Victoria in her morning
walk on Arthur's Seat, she called her Majesty's attention to
the beautiful cemetery in the distant valley, and expressed a
wish that when she died she might be buried there. Last
year, when her Majesty was going north, Miss Benanomi,
who, as usual, was attending her royal mistress, became in-
disposed in Holyrood Palace, and was unable to proceed fur-
ther. By order of Her Majesty, Miss Benanomi was attended
by an eminent physician, but she never recovered, and died
in Holyrood Palace. Her Majesty was deeply affected by the
death, and, remembering the wish of Miss Benanomi, ordered
the remains to be buried in Rose Bank Cemetery, and the
monument with the inscription quoted to be erected to her
Memory.—Caledonian Mercury.—[Rose Bank Cemetery is
in a suburb immediately to the south of Edinburgh.]
A REMARKABLE MAN.—This city is now the home of one
of the most remarkable men of the age—a man who has tra-
versed the civilized globe, and established in almost every
country which he has visited the sale of his medicines for the
relief of human suffering, and which are a certain cure for
disease in all its forms. We allude to Professor Thomas
Holloway, of London. It is now several years since this
benefactor of the human race first proclaimed to the world,
through the British press, that he had, after deep research, pre-
pared a remedy that was sure to eradicate disease. Years of
patient investigation into the laws of human physiology which
control our bodies in health and when diseased, led to the in-
vention and preparation of the world-renowned Holloway's
Pills and Ointment. Nearly, if not quite, one half of the
haman race have taken his medicines ! His name is as uni-
versally known over the globe as that of Alexander, Napoleon,
or Washington, when in the height of their ambitious career.
If they conquered nations on the field of battle, Professor
Holloway has, with no weapon but that of science, conquered
disease in all its forms. His meritorious career is bounded
by no imaginary lines of latitude and longitude short of those
marking the confines of civilization itself. No isolated country
or nation was sufficiently extensive for the operation of his
enterprising and gigantic intellect. Wherever disease has a
residence, there he has penetrated with his medicines, and left
an enviable and enduring reputation. After enlightening
Europe, his fame spread over Asia, and the civilized portions
of Africa, and finally appeared in America. He has translated
the cures he has performed, and the virtues of his medicines,
into as many languages as the missionaries have the Bible.
GOvernments, otherwise the most despotic, have been forced
by the great value of his medicines, and their popularity with
the people, to remove antiquated and time-honored restrictions
upon the introduction of foreign medicines, and open their
custom houses to a free introduction to the Pills and Oint-
ment, of this distuingished man. Empires and kingdoms
removed the barriers of ages against the introduction and sale
of proprietary or patent medicines, and freely permitted Hollo-
way's medicines to become the physician of the masses.—New
York Dispatch.
TRIAL ROR MOBBING AND RIOTING.—At the High Court of
Justiciary, Edinburgh, on Monday last, four young men were
placed at the bar charged with mobbing and rioting, and with
assault and injury to property, at Greenock, on the of April
last, on which occasion a large mob assembled in front of the
Roman Catholic Chapel there, beat in the doors with a large
beam. broke the windows with Avn., anti couunlited other
damage to the chapel, as well as to the school and the adjoin-
ing dwelling-houses of the priest and teacher. In sum-
ming up the evidence, the Lord Justice-General laid down
the law as to participating in or giving countenance to
riotous acts. He said,—" All those who were in- the
mob and who took an active part in it were guilty of
the whole proceedings of that mob generally. The jury
returned a verdict of guilty of mobbing and rioting against
the prisoners, but not of participating in the acts of
assault and injury libelled, The Lord Justice-General, after
stating that the Court were disposed, from extenuating
circumstances in each case, to treat the prisoners with leniency,
said,—" You must not suppose that you are punished because
of the particular object you had in view, as being connected
with any following out of the religious opinions which you
yourselves entertain in opposition to those of the persons
whose property was to be sacrificed by these proceedings. It
is not because you entertain particular opinions, or because
with zeal,
that we are going to
ris it because of any
yproounmonanincetaian
sentence
opuipnoinyoin it
particular favour to the religious opinions of those whose
property has been assailed. In this country all parties, all
subjects of the Queen, all who are residing within the range
of the laws, are amenable to the laws, and entitled to the
protection which they afford. We know no distinction
of religious parties in any question of this kind. In
this country all persons are entitled not only to enter-
tain what religious opinions they please, but to profess
those opinions, and to worship according to their own
faith, whatever it may be. Be they Jews or Gentiles,
Pagans or Christians, Papists or Protestants, Episcopalians or
Presbyterians, it is all the same. The law says that they have
a right to worship after their own fashion, and that law will
protect them in the exercise of this right. Therefore you must
'not suppose, and no persons must suppose, that we enter into
the religious question here ; but while we hear rumours of
persecutions for religious opinions in other countries, and are
inclined to sympathize with the sufferers, and to feel indigna-
tion at the conduct of the oppressors, it would be very wrong
indeed if in this country which boasts of being a land of liberty,
where persons are entitled to freedom of conscience without
any restraint, except that which conscience itself imposes, any
proceeding which involves violence against parties on account
of their religious opinions should be permitted to go unpunished.
While the law permits them to have liberty, those who
administer the law must take care that that liberty is pre-
served to them, and not abused by the strong. It is because
you have violated that law, and for no other reason, that we
now pronoun&amp; sentence of imprisonment upon you." His
Lordship then sentenced three of the rioters to six, and one to ,
three months' imprisonment,

MR. BERKELEY has been returned for Cheltenham by a
majority of 682 over Mr. Ridler.
ON Friday evening a lomotive engine, employed on the
North London • Railway, exploded; but though it destroyed
some property, no persons were injured.
THE COLONIAL SECRETARYSHIP.—Tnn Advertiser says
Sir William Molesworth and Sir George Grey are spoken of
for the colonial vacancy. The Herald says Mr. Vernon Smith,
Sir Wm. Molesworth, and Lord Harrowby are mentioned.
THE QUEEN, accompanied by Prince Albert, the King of
tha Belgians, the Count de Flanders, the Prince of Wales, and
Prince Alfred, attended by their suite, left Buckingham
Palace on Tuesday, for Osborne.
DURING a debate in the House of Lords last week, no little
sensation was caused by the entry into the house of Sir- Au-
gustus Clifford, bearing on his arm the celebrated Miss
O'Neill, now Lady Wrixon Becher.
•
THE Advertiser states that a meeting of Conservative
members of the House of Commons took place on Saturday,
at Mr Disraeli's. The attendance was very numerous, and
never was the feeling of the party more cordial and unani-
mous as to the course to be pursued by it.
THE SPECIE' arrivals during theweek have been moderate,
and do not amount to £185,000. The exports of which we
have any notification are little more than £60,000, but the
shipments to the Continent by the bullion merchants have
been considerable.

ON Tuesday morning the corning-house at Messrs. Curtis
and Harvey's Clyde Gunpowder Mills, Glenlean,' about five
miles from Dunoon, blew up with a fearful explosion, by
which casualty the lives of not fewer than four men have
been lost.

COLONEL FLEURY, the colonel of the French Guides, has
married Mad'lle Calais St. Paul, a daughter of a rich homme
d'affaires of Paris. On this occasion the Emperor made the
colonel the munificent present of 500,000 franks from his
private purse, and also settled a pension of 12,000 franks
a-year, to make things pleasant, to a lady who went down on
her knees to supplicate his Majesty to prevent the marriage.
MILITARY DISTURBANCE.—The town of Chatham, on
Thursday evening, exhibited a scene of military riot, between
the marines and sailors against the 27th regiment. Several
of the soldiers were wounded in the affray, and one man was
so severely injured that he was taken to the hospital, having
received three bayonet wounds.

SCA.ELATINA. IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD AT OSBORNE.—
Their Royal Highnesses Princess Louisa and Prince Arthur
have been attacked with scarlatina. Their Royal Highnesses
are going on very favourably. The same disease has declared
itself in his Royal Highness Prince Leopold, who was left at
Buckingham Palace in consequence of a slight accident.

THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.—The work
for the next Presidental election has seriously commenced.
The political events have sharply defined the three great par-
ties of the campaign, and the champion of each for the suc-
cession. These three parties are—the American party, the
Seward anti-slavery coalition party, and the Democratic party ;
and the candidate of each, as broadly foreshadowed by these
late events, is, of the American party, George Law, of New
York; of the Seward coalition party, W. H. Seward, of New
York; of the Democratic party, Henry A. Wise, of Virginia.

THE GRIND STAND AT. AINTREE RACE-COURSE - was,
during the late meeting, entrusted to the care of Mr. Morrish,
of the Merchants' Dining Roams, Lancaster-buildings, Tithe-
barn-street. The care and judicious attention bestowed on
the cuisine and the cellar were such as called forth the warmest
encomiums from the numerous visitors ; while the orderly and
ready service bestowed on the guests reflected the highest
credit on the skill and assiduity of Mr. Morrish as a caterer
for even the most refined tastes. Every delicacy was to be
'et with in ready profusion, and the more substantial elements
of good cheer were served with equal alacrity and abundance.
The wines and liquors of all kinds were excellent, and met
general approval.
THE DANUBE.-A letter from Bucharest of the 3d, in the
German Journal of Frankfort, says :—" The Ottoman troops
are still advancing into the Dobrudscha. From 1,200 to 1,500
Turks from Silistria have passed the Danube in boats, and
landed at Kalarasch. Although the Turkish corps now in the
-Dobrudscha are sufficiently provided .with bridge equipage,
and is supported by a flotilla, and, although the coast of Bes-
sarabia is only defended by about 10,000 Russians, yet it is
not expected that the Muchir Ismail Pasha has any present
intention of attacking the Russians. He appears inclined to
wait for the fall of Sebastopol, in which case he would doubt-
less be supported by some allied troops. The greatest com-
mercial activity prevails on the Lower Danube. It is calculated
that, since the opening of the navigation, more than 500
vessels, of which 200 were Austrian, have taken on board
cargoes at Ibrail and at Galatz."

flit LATE CAPTAIN Lroxs.—The enclosed extract from a
letter from one of the officers of the Miranda may be interest-
ing to our readers:—" Tlaerapia, June 25.—Our brave Captain
is no more. His wound was mortal, and he died on Saturday
night. C— was with him the whole time, and S--=-= says
his death was worthy of his life. He forgot nothing, sending
messages to each of us individually, and arranging for the
smallest trifles. He said to C--, ' I die '.s a captain of a
man-of-war ought to die.' The navy has lost its greatest
ornament ; and we have lost one who, to us, was more than a
friend. He was so brave, so great,' so good,'and so amiable,
that we all loved him much snore than we knew. We buried
him on Monday evening, the 26th of June, with all naval
honours. Crowds of people of high rank attended Isis funeral.
The head of our figurehead, Miranda, was shot away almost at
the same moment. that our dear captain received his death
wound.

FIRE AT ILITECIERFORD-MARKET.—On Sunday evening
considerable alarm was caused in the vicinity of Hungerford-
market, London, in consequence of a fire breaking out on the
wharf of the market, occasioned by some boys accidentally
emptying their pipes on a waggon laden with straw. On the
sudden outbrezk messengers were despatched for the Chandos-
street, Watling-street, West of England, and various other
engines, which promptly arrived, and speedily got to work,
with a good supply of water from the mains of the New River.
The wind blowing strongly, the flames spread with amazing
rapidity, and five carts and one waggon belonging to Mr. Mil-
igan, hay and strawdealer opposite the booking-office, on the
wharf, as well .e Mr. T. kiendersua'3 cavts; speedily ignited.
The firemen worked most strenuously, and by dint of great
perseverance the flames were subdued, but not until the straw
and carts were nearly destroyed.

LORD Jorm Rus-sr.r.L.—Lord John Russell is no longer a
member of the Administration. In consequence of repre-
sentations from some of the members of the Government in
the House of Commons as to the difficulty under which they
laboured with regard to the motion of Sir E. B. Lytton, his
lordship came to the resolution of removing their embarrass-
ment by retiring from the Ministry. Accordingly, at his re-
quest, Lord Palmerston yesterday acquainted the Queen with
the resolution to which Lord John had come, and her Majesty
was pleased to accept his resignation. No successor to Lord
John Russell as Secretary of State for the Colonies has been
appointed, but it is not improbable that one will be desig-
nated for her Majesty's approval at the Cabinet Council to be
held this afternoon. We cannot, of course, speak with cer-
tainty upon the subject, but we believe it is not unlikely that
the new Colonial Secretary will be taken from amongst the
present members of the Cabinet, and we apprehend that his
fitness for the post will be at once recognized by the country
and the colonies.—Globe, of Saturday.
THUNDERSTORM ON SATURDAY.—ShortIy after 6 o'clock
on Saturday morning, the metropolis was visited by a violent
thunderstorm, which continued for nearly an hour. The
lightning was of a vivid character. The rain fell in torrents,
and many of the small streets at the east end of London were
flooded for several hours. The market gardeners' grounds
were also inundated, and considerable damage was done by
the great fall of rain. At Bristol the storm took place an
hour or two previously. It commenced about half-past three
o'clock, and exceeded in violence anything of the kind that
has occurred in that city for the last 30 years. The thunder
was very violent, and the lightning so vivid that the Captains
of African and Indian ships in the port describe it as being
the nearest approach to a tropical tornado that they ever
witnessed in this country. Considerable damage was done by
the hail, which beat the wheat down in all the surrounding
country, and broke thousands of panes of glass; and at St.
George's,Gloucestershire,the electric fluid struck a house near
the Don John's-cross, destroyed the chimneys, and split the
house from the roof to the basement story.

SUNDAY DISTITEBANCES IN LONDON. HYDE-RAIZ/K.—
The Sunday demonstrations in this park are unmistakably dying
out, and in another week or two there will be no trace left of
the commotion. On Sunday the number of people assembled
showed a decided falling off, and the more respectable classes
held themselves carefully apart from the crowds of urchins
and thieves who had collected. Of course, they did all in their
power to get up a disturbance, rushing hither and thither,
making as much noise as possible, and scurrying away as
soon as they came in collision with the police. Beyond a con-
siderable amount of pocket-picking very little mischief was
done, and the number of offenders taken into custody tended
powerfully to check the disposition to riot. The police did not
show in the park itself, but at the different outlets and in the
neighbourhood they were mustered- in ample force, while
a mounted patrol kept up with the quick movements of the
mob, and prevented any serious injury to property being at-
tempted. No carriages appeared in the drive, so that no fa-
cilities existed for getting up a disturbance, and we may fairly
hope that next Sunday afternoon the park will present its
usual peaceable aspect. Two attempts were made by the
rabble to penetrate into Belgravia from Albert-gate, but both
were promptly repulsed by the police, and the ringleaders ar-
rested.

STATE OP THE MORMON COMMUNITY.—The Cambridge
0h.•.,,,;,1. Rives a letter from Salt Lake City by a woman who
bad embraced tile ‘l.lmign. and left that neiolbour-
hood. The expose speaks for itseir
and Mormonism in the old country are two entirely distinct
systems. You know not whom to trust; in fact, you are sus-
picious of everybody, and everybody suspects you. Human
life is of no value here ; cutting throats is as carelessly talked
of from the stand as clipping your finger-nails ; indeed, if they
consider you becoming at all disaffected to their principles, it
is considered doing you a kindness to kill you, that your soul
may be saved. It is heresy to think of leaving the, society ;
and should any make the attempt, every obstacle is thrown in
their way. Scandal and lies the people fatten on. I would
defy the smallest village in the world to propagate the same
with more avidity than this people. A woman's character is
taken away by the slightest breadth ; you are at everybody's
mercy, no matter how low, mean, or contemptible the party
may be ; and woe to you should your husband be on a mission!
They set husband' against wife : try to get the husband into
'plurality; and women's hearts are as ruthlessly broken as a
piece of straw by bending. Divorces can be readily obtained,
for from five to terrdollars ; and there exists not, I verily be-
lieve, as I believe in a God, a more miserable, broken-hearted,
canwor

corn, irrigate the land, raise babies (one in twenty-seven
months is the allotted time), besides attending to the no less
essential points in a house, viz., washing, scrubbing, and cook-
ing; the latter item is by no means an unimportant one in a
Yankee household, as Yankee Doodle must have tea three
times a day, and hot bread at each meal. The United States
sent out a detachment of men in the fall, ostensibly en route
to California, but really to investigate the many crying atroci-
ties in this horrible place. There has been a slight intermix-
ture with the officers and our people in society; but I think
Brigham was afraid of their influence, and at once, without any
preliminiaries, they were denounced from the stand in the
most bitter terms ; and so general was the insult that the
commanding officers ordered the United States flag to be taken
down. Happy as 'I should be to save others from the degrada-
tion and misery of this evil place, I dare not have my name
known, or my head would pay the forfeit ; and they would
think they were doing God and me service. Although I have
lost all desire for life, I should dread falling into their hands;
for verily the tortures of the Inquisition were nothing to those
they inflict here, and in the end I should be consigned to a
horrible decapitation."

STREET PREACHING.

--41.---

ONE of the special characteristics of the Christian
mission was stated, b 3 its Divine Fou—nder, 'to The,
that the Gospel was preached to the poor; and, that
she was the " Church of .the Poor," was once one of
the chief glories of the Church of England. This
character she earned by providing, through the
bounty of her richer children, that in every parish in
the land the Gospel machinery should be brought
home to each man's door, and that its ministry to him
should not depend on his ability to pay for it. That
the sacred labourer is worthy of his hire, is certainly
a Christian principle ; but' not that his labours should
be placed on a level with secular employments, and
the pecuniary support of the labourer calculated as a
quid pro quo for the value of his services.
It is impossible to travel through the parishes of
England, without perceiving how strictly, •in theory,
the Church has acted upon this principle ; it is impos-
sible to examine the lavish profuseness of her noble
ecclesiastical foundations, without thankfully acknow-
ledging how well she has fulfilled her Lord's mission

in this particular. The darker side of the picture,
however, remains for us, and for days of " peculiar
Gospel enlightenment." It is equally impossible to

see the parish churches, in their present desolation,
or to walk through the districts of our towns, without
being compelled to admit that the Church of England
no longer in fact possesses this high character.
With regard to many of her finest parish churches,
given to the poor by the pious liberality of our ances-

tors, they have been taken from them, and placed at

the disposal of the richer classes, by the erection of
pews, guarded by doors and numbered as part of
a rented property, belonging, for all uses, to
the -person - rents them. In numberless
cases, where the most liberal endowments have beep
made for the frequent performance of divine ser-
vice, and the maintenance of a sufficient body of
clergy, these endowments have been stolen for the
benefit of a lay impropriator, and barely enough left
for the support of a single minister, the assistance of
one of our charitable societies being necessary to
maintain a second. But these, we may say, were the
crimes of an earlier generation. Let us ask, what we
are doing to extend the blessings of the unpurchased
Gospel through the unprovided districts of our towns ?
Kai, whatever we have done, or whatever we are
doing, this is confessed on all sides, that the Church
has not yet regained her hold upon the poor. Churches
are rising around us, but they are not built for the
poor. Eloquent proclamations of the Gospel ring in
our ears on all sides, but the rich purchase them for
themselves. Each man pays for his religion as for
any other luxury, or, if you will, necessity, of his life.,
A preacher is " liked ;" a Church is built for him
that is, a permanent investment is made for his mainte-
nance ; his admirers appropriate its sittings, and they
think their homage to religion has been paid. They
rush in crowds to hang upon his accents, and think
they must be very earnest followers of the Gospel.
They listen, perhaps, to his denunciations of a corrupt
religion, and flatter themselves that they are cham-
pions for the purity of Christianity. They feed, or,
think they feed, from a plenteous table, and the pri-
vilege of the poor is, that, perchance, they may gather
up some of the crumbs which fall from the entertain-
ment of their betters. It is clear that popular reli-
gion has not yet found out the way of carrying the
Gospel in its integrity to the poor.

" The poor will not come to Church!" Granted.
But this is a strange complaint from you who do not
build churches for the poor. This is a grave inconsis-
tency in your mouths who absolutely refuse to have
churches built for the poor. This is but a vain lip
lamentation from you who interfere with the inten-
tions of earnest men with your miserable disputes and
factious accusations, while the poor perish around you,
and who yourselves do not take up the work which
you prevent others from doing, because you disagree
with them on some point of doctrine or peculiarity of
form.

But we may yet find opportunity to expound our
idea of the causes of this fact which stares us in the
face, viz., that the Church has lost her hold upon the
poor ; and also of the remedies which the case demands.
At present we are pressed with one mode of remedy
which has regained of late the prominence it had lost,
and which has occupied much local attention during
the last few days.

We took occasion, some time since, to allude to the
advisability, in the " present distress," of street preach-
ing, conducted with caution and judgment. And the
philosophy, if we may so employ the term, of street
preaching, we appirhend to be this : that it should be
used only as a preparation to the direct agency of the
Church. We must not have Christianity expounded
at the corners of our streets and in the market place
as a mere school of ethics, or system of doctrines
which each man may adequately realise, and then be
left to himself. Street preaching is a mere endeavour
to startle into inquiry the careless and profligate, to
argue from their experience of some mysterious power
of evil which tyrannises over their inner man, and
crushes every better aspiration to the need in which
they stand of a deliverance, to the importance of
the fact that a Deliverer has come upon earth,
and that if they are willing they may be brought
within the scope of that " Mighty power whereby He
is able to subdue all things unto Himself." If the
example of the Apostles be adduced for street preach-
ing, from the naked fact that they did preach in the
highways and thoroughfares, it must be followed to
s issue. With them Christianity was not merely
the hearing and believing of certain doctrines, but the
induction into a community ; and of those who ac-
cepted their teaching it was recorded that the LORD
added them to the Church, and that they continued
steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship,
and in the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers.
v.,,aching, therefore, must not be adopted as a
building churches, and setting up the
substitute
full machinery of the Gospel. It must be used as a
mere check to the everyday course of blind wicked-
ness travelled by the besotted thousands who are
perishing for lack of knowledge. It is not the remedy
for their ills, but it is to inform them of their need of
a remedy, and to induce them to turn aside from the
way of their wickedness to the messenger whom
CHRIST has commissioned on earth to lead their foot-
steps to the cross.
It was with this idea that, in our previous remarks
on the agency of street preaching, we recommended
this mode of its employment, namely, that a district
should be marked out and appropriated to a particular
pastor with his assistants ; and that these clergy
should undertake the public invitation of the people
committed to their charge—that, having built up a
living Church, a school-room or temporary building
having been used in the meanwhile, a material temple
of the Lord should rise in their midst; built for them,
perhaps partially built by them, made theirs, that
they might hereafter enjoy the blessings which they
had learnt amid many difficulties to feel their want of
and to appreciate.
without, therefore, arguing it on the ground of
ecclesiastical order,---which, if there be such a thing as
order, must be at
once decisive against one pastor's
preaching in the parish
of another without that
other's consent,---it will be at once apparent what view
we take of the scheme set on foot by the Rev. Dr.
111`1•Inux, of preaching on the Exchange Flags. If
the object of street preaching be what we have supposed,
that must be a very inadequate mode of conducting
it, by which it is turned into a mere advertised attrac.

tion for novelty-hunters and personal admirers. To
select a respectable area in the middle of the counting-
houses, and business resorts of the merchants and
middle classes, and invite those who may choose for
some motive or other to come, is not carrying the
Gospel to the hovels of the poor. This is not going
'out into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring-
ing in the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and
blind ; it is not going. into_ the highwap and hedges,
and compelling them to come in. Dr. 31`NEILE may
say that, without wishing his plan to be followed in
every respect, his intention is merely to make the
Practice of open-air preaching respectable for his less
known brethren. But is the example of so pleasant a
mode of its performance likely to incite them to
the endurance of its harsher and heavier inflictions ?
Will they be induced ; by this display with a flourish of
trumpets, and a flattering audience drawn from all
parts of the town, to plod on in unknown paths,
where no admiring eye can cheer, where notoriety
cannot tickle vanity, and excitement carries with it no
charm ? No. They will strive to escape the disa-
greeables of their duty ; and their work will fail through
a disregard of that great law alike of morals and of
religion, that no permanent good is ever done in this
world but through self-denial and suffering. Really,
if the Rev. Doctor wishes to set an effective example,
he will in future confine himself to his own district ;
and, giving him credit for the best intentions, we do
not think it necessary to say more at present on the
subject.

FROM OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.

MONDAY MORNING,

TITB past has been a busy and a bustling week in all those
places "where politicians most do congregate." The Clubs
have exhibited an amount of commotion akin to that which
apiarists inform us takes place in a bee-hive, when the ento-
mological republic, having become too hot to hold its members,
is involved in the anarchy of a revolutionary movement which
ends only with thedeath or extrusion of one of the contending
h-oits. The House of Commons has been convulsed in all its
points, the galleries and division lobbies sharing in the agita-
tion ; nay more, the Council Chamber itself has once more
been the scene of those amiable contentions which some
months ago were of such frequent occurrence ; and which
were intimated to the outer world by the mysterious announce-
ment that " Ministers remained in close deliberation for up-
wards of three hours." A declaration which those pretending
to be in the secret interpreted into a confession that Ministers
have been in hot and violent altercation for the time specified,
and that in most cases it conveyed to the Ministerial hangers-on
intelligence of a similarly pleasing character to that communi-
cated to an anxious ship's crew, when, during the night, they
are assailed by the sudden and alarming cry of "breakers a-head."
Every one felt assured of an impending crisis, from the
ominous Parliamentary conclusion of the preceding week,
which was wound up by the melancholy display of -Lord
Join. RUSSELL in his frequently enacted character of the
Double-dealer. Consequent on the discreditable disclosures
made by his Lordship in the House on the evening of Friday
se'nnight, and which, besides the condemnation of friends and
foes in that august assembly, drew down upon his devoted
head the unmitigated indignation of the country, Sir E. B.
LYTTON gave notice on Tuesday night of a motion to the
effect, "That the conduct of the Minister charged with the
negotiations at Vienna, and his continuance in office as a
responsible adviser of the Crown, have shaken the confidence
which the country should place in those to whom the adminis-
tration of public affairs is entrusted." The intimation of a
motion-so pointedly in unison with popular feeling, yet withal
so temperately expressed, and so extensively sympathised in
by the House of Commons, as well as by their constituents,
was the first thing which appears to have created alarm for the
safety of their places in the ministerial mind. To gain time
for a consideration of the defensible points of the position, was•
the first object clutched at—to secure the uncertain support of
waverers—and to enlist the Irish Brigade, or, as they delight
to call themselves,the cohortof "fifty independent votes," was
the next Move, and both of these "dodges" were played of
with a skill and hardihood which could only have been ac-
quired by extensive and frequent practice. The motion is to
decide the important question whether the nation will tolerate
the continuance in office of a minister who entertains, or at
least professes a public and a private opinion, diametrically
opposed to each other on so important a -point as the continu-
ance of war, or the conclusion of peace; and by implication
whether his colleagues, who were cognizant of these discre-
pant views, and continued to act in concert with him, are not
as bad and as untrustworthy as he is. Such a motion is a
matter of no trivial moment. It broadly impugns the honour
of one member, and touches nearly the reputation of all the
cabinet ; and it is brought forward in no petulant spirit ; nor
is it tabled by an, intriguer for place. A motion so pregnant
with consequences is one which no ministry can lie under and
retain any function of utility. So long as the accusations it
implies are unrebutted, the moral influence of the Cabinet is
annihilated ; and, under these circumstances, the course of
action open to a man of spirit, or of a ministry which covetted
power merely that it might serve the country, is to meet and
if possible to disprove the accusations. To such a course of
behaviour the PALMERSTON administration makes no pretence.
Instead of offering facilities for bringing the question to im-
mediate issue, the PREMIER treats the subject with his cus-
tomary levity, and when asked if it would be convenient
to take the discussion on this very important motion on Fri-
day, the day usually set apart for questions of supply, he an-
swered snappishly that Friday was set apart for discussing
" The New Partnerships Bill" and the " Limited Liability
Bill." Two topics peculiarly apposite to the ricketty condition
of the Cabinet, without doubt, but still not of a sufficiently
important nature to take preference of one which, by its moral
influence, paralysed the whole functions of Government at a
juncture of the national affairs when united counsels and com-
bined energies are indispensable to the safety of the State.
The unbecoming facetiousness of the noble PREMIER MS so
pointedly rebuked by Mr. DISRAELI, that for once Lord PAL-
MERSTON was checked " dead up," and with an assumed air
of indifference he agreed to peril the existence of the Adminis-
tration on the issue of the motion this evening. In the mean
time, however, all the manoeuvres of party tactics had been
pressed into the service of the impeached Ministry. Conces—
sions had been made to a deputation of the "Brass Band," by,
which it was hoped to secure their aid in the event of a close-
contest. Other means also were not neglected, and rumours
were industriously circulated by and among the Ministerial
underlines to the effect that, like CURTIUS of old, Lord.
Joan would plunge into the gulf which, unless propitiated
by a sacrifice of that description, would assuredly swallow
up the whole Cabinet. The magnanimity of the proposedsolf-
immolation was praised in his lordship's hearing, amidst strong
expressions of regret for the necessity of the sacrifice. Still
his lordship made no sign. Other hints were thrown out as
to the necessity of providing a Cabinet JONAH, who by-being
thrown overboard might still the raging waters which
threatened to engulf the ministerial barque. But still Lord
Rum gave small show of understanding ; and he who was so
sensitively prompt with his resignation on a recent occasion,
which merely threatened to unship his colleagues, cosid not be
made to budge when another set of colleagues would by his
„c„es„,tion obtain a ulauxcU of rescue from impending ship.
wreck. More desperate expedients were resorted to, expedients
of so disreputable a kind as hardly to meet with. belief. In
reference to the position in which he was placed, the Daily
News says ;—" He was ready to stand the- brunt of the
threatened assault and to abide the consequences. Not so the.
men by whom he had been surrounded. Seared at the sound'
of the rising storm of popular indignation), and solicitous only
for the retention of power—men who six weeks ago were
ready to acquiesce without hesitation in the proposal of com-
promise with Russia suggested by Coant,Buox, have not been
ashamed to join in forcing Lord JonN to tender his resignation
to the head of the government. Through every rank and grade
of the party, efforts have been made to further this design. The
pride of the SECRETARY for the Cowsius having been stung
into making the offer we have mentioned, resort was had to
the respectable and high•spirited device of a round robin
addressed to Lord PALMERSTON, urging him to accept the
resignation. This document was actually hawked about the
precincts and passages of the House of Commons during the
sitting of the House, yesterday (Thursday), and while the
two noble lords continued to occupy their usual seats, side
by side, up= the-Treasury bench. We are unwilling to state
how many names of men calling themselves Whigs are
appended to it ; but, we believe, we may venture to say, that
the rebukes which its authors encountered from the manly
and independent members who refused to act a part fit only
for sailors in a mutiny on shipboard, served to convince them
that their clumsy device is one too shameless even for the
present House of Commons." The reader who cons over the
above, and reflects on some of the recent moves of Lord
Joint himself, will be involuntarily impelled to put the Whig
party in the position of SITYLOCK, and make it, in the language
of that worthy, exclaim to his lordship, " The villany you
teach me I will execute ; and it shall go hard but I will
better the instruction," Whether they made so plain a
declaration or not,. they seem to have acted on the maxim.
They do- not, -however, appear to have perilled their case
entirely on those means of accomplishing their purpose, strong
and disreputable as those means were. The Times says

`1 The members of the government in the House of Commons

not included in the Cabinet, represented by Mr. BouvEnn,

are reported to have informed him (Lord JOHN RUSSELL)
that they were not prepared to vote against Sir BuLvrEc.
LYTTON'S motion." The Times adds, " This removed all
doubt as to the result of the impending division." It left
poor Lord Josn no alternative but to " adjust his mantle ere
he fell," with the best grace he might ; and he resigned. The
preceding delineations of Whig perfidy and meanness are
drawn by " liberal" 'artists, and. froin'their knowledge of the
men, and also of the Jacts referredio, the_picture, however
humiliating and repulsive, is entitled to belief.
Of late Lord.Jourr RUSSELL has become somewhat noto-
rious.for th,e nature,
.the freedom, and the. peculiar fashion of
his explanations. Another scene, it is to be hoped the last one'
yet awaits him as an expository commentator on the sayings
and doings of his quondam colleagues. The eloquent phil-
fipple he delivered on the occasion of dismissing Lord PAL .
MERSTON from the Foreign Secretaryship, which that noble-
man held under his lordship, is too recent to have been for-
gotten, or to require repetition; he may, however, and in all
probability will, indulge in a few supplementary strokes just
to complete the portrait, and as it were bring it down to the
present day. His able performances in the portraiture of the

Earl of ABERDEEN and the Duke of NEWCASTLE will scarcely

require either repetition or retouching to render them crack
specimens of delineative, if not very friendly, art ; but, when
he comes to fill in the portraits of Mr. BOUVERIE and that
honourable gentleman's coadjutors, something racy, as well as
spirited, may be reasonably anticipated. His tour de force,
however, will, in all likelihood, be reserved for finishing the
high-minded devisers of the "round robin," or which the radical
scribe of the Daily News represents most unfairly as " fit
only for sailors in a mutiny on shipboard." No human con-
stitution, however, is equal to the tasks in this line to which
his lordship subjects himself, and even the amateur vigour of
voluntary performances of the kind referred to have a
debilitating effect on the performer; and to this condition
of humanity Lord Jonx RUSSELL forms no exception.
This fact was made painfully manifest on Friday evening,

when he essayed an answer to a question put by Mr.
DISRAELI, on the preceding night, when Lord Jou was not
in the House. It had been currently reported during the day
that the answer would be given, and at six o'clock, when the
sitting commenced, every thing gave indication of an ex-
pected statement of importance. The body of the house was
crowded by members; in the Peers' Gallery there was a con-
siderable gathering of peers, including the Earl of ALBE-
mARLE, Lord Wrifroan, and Lord CAMPBELL; and every
eye was fixed on the spot occupied by the expected orator.
After one disappointment, the audience were so far gratified
by his Lordship addressing himself to the task in hand,—the
expected explanation. The display was anything but a
pleasing or exciting one. He was evidently out of spirits and
out of humour. He spoke in a tone of voice indicative of ex-
treme dejection, and so low as to be scarcely audible. His
speech, which was but a brief one, produced but little' effect,
and was heard very imperfectly. He reiterated his statement
that he considered the Austrian proposals might at the time
have been accepted with advantage. The statement fell upon
listless and incredulous ears; and when he came to the aver-
ment that he thought they could not now be adopted with
propriety—and that consequently he was for a vigorous
prosecution of the war, his declaration was received with
contumelious laughter ; even his own friends of the old Whig
party Smiling scornfully at the attempted double. That very
pure tribe now affect to view what he thought and they ad-
mitted to be strokes of profound cunning, as childish indica-
tions of weakness and deceit which never imposed upon any
one. They profess now to say that by his last false. move
he has rudely destroyed all faith in his capacity as a states-
man ; and what is more, that he has destroyed all confidence
in his sincerity and truthfulness as a man—that lie has corn.
mitted political suicide. So complete a political and moral
prostration has seldom fallen to the lot of any individual who
held a prominent place in the national eye.

In the meantime, the result of Sir E. B. LYTTON'S, motion
is anxiously canvassed in the political circles of all parties.
On the part of the Government out-and-out supporters-, it is
said that, by a skilful application of his carefully-studied tac-
tics,—and now that he has got rid of Lord JOHN, as' a kind
of " Old Man of the Sea," who rode upon and galled the neck
of his administration,—LordPAlMEßSTON will defeat the mo-
tion by a considerable majority. On the other hand, they
maintain that, if hard run on a division, or even if beaten, he
will not resign, but have recourse to a dissolution,- appealing
to- the country on his determination to prosecute the. war
with' vigour and alacrity. Many individuals, however, and
the parties who have probable means of knowing, declare
that the whole Government must go with Lord Jour RE'S--
SELL ; that the country is heartily-sick of one and all of them,
and will admit of no compromise in getting rid of them. A
few,-who profess to know exactly how the matter rests; will
have it that the Conservative party have the game entirely' in
their own hands. These individuals maintain that an. influ-
ential deputation of the Conservative party left Lonibm im-
mediately on its being known that the PALMERSTON Cabinet
had, resolved to eject Lord Jourr, and that that deputation
proceeded directly to Knowsley, to consult with the Earl of
DERBY; who received them most kindly and entered =into
their views with alacrity. A prevalent statement among.the
promulgators of the list-mentioned rumour is to the effect
that a strong 'Conservative Government will be immediately
formed, among the first of whose proceedings will be auappeal
to the constituencies:- Whatever shall come out of' it, the
Whigs- seem disposed to put their house in order, afar as
they are able, and to provide apartments, if possible,. for the
more-necessitous and clamorous of their friends. On Friday
a report obtained confident circulation in Lincoln's-Inn;. that
Chief Justice JERVISi' of the Common-Pleas, will immediately
resign his seat, and be succeeded by Sir A. COCICRVEN? Lord
PaLarzaSTON'S Attorney‘General.

As on similar previous occasions, everything has giTen:pace,
in the public mind, to a consideration of the government
dead-lock. Even the war itself, out of which all the contre-
temps of recent occurrence have direetlyor indirectly sprang,
has for the instant ceased to occupy the chief place in general
attention. Still the morsels of intelligence which come fre-
quently, although in no instance fraught with mush informa-
tion, or made the bearers of very important results,. are never-
theless so far satisfactory that, while detailing no great or
startling achievement, they are destitute of evil tidings, and
are on the whole favourable to our ultimate suceesa. The
attacking works of the English have been pushed, with suc-
cess, considerably nearer the Redan ;. one account- states that
the cemetery so gallantly taken by our troops on.the 18th of
last month, and so unaccountably resigned after having been
held for fourteen hours, was re-occupied by our men on the
following day, and still remais- in our possession. In the
meantime, Prone various sources,information is received repre-
senting the state of the Russian army as very deplorable, and.
their losses, in the way of transmitting reinforcements to the.
Crimea, as gigantic and overwhelming. Our new commander.
in-chief appears to be labouring on, undismayed by difficulties
or opposition, both of which he appears to disregard. The
health of our troops is represented as in all respects satisfac-
tory on the whole, and everything appears,to wear the air of
approaching success. As regards the proceedings of General
PELISSIEMi opinion seems divided in the Crimea and in Paris,
as in some degree in this country. In most respects he is
regarded, as a brilliant and dashing soldier who has no
idea of fear, and . some say too little of consequences=--such
a general, indeed, as, would lead a brave army through
any amount of obstacles and opposition in the field, and as
one in every respect equal to any emergency which can be
aneeamifolly npposaci_by indomit.tia_will. and oveveonae by the
moat uncompromising activity, and the most daring enter-
prise. While such is the prevalent opinion respecting his
general merits and qualifications, military critics, and espe-
cially in France, where they are both numerous and accute,
concur in representing him as impetuous and rash, and as a
man not well fitted for the conduct of such an enterprise as
the reduction of a fortress like Sebastopol. In confirmation
of this theory, they point to numerous instances, in which
they maintain that the successes he has achieved in the
Crimea are not equal to the sacrifices at which they have been
attained ; and, as an irrefragable evidence of the accuracy of
these views, they point with melancholy significance to the
sad tissue of blunders which commenced, accompanied, and
concluded the desperate conflict of the 18th of June. One• of
these gentlemen, in speaking on the subject of Paaissixn's
qualifications, delivers himself as follows :—" The rapidity and
decision of the French Generalissirao's movements are pro-
verbial. ' Take me that battery, though it cost twenty lives,'
he says, and the troops rush to the exploit. The battery is
not taken, but forty lives are sacrificed. Well, then, try it
again at the expense of two hundred.' Four hundred fall !
Still the feat is not accomplished. Let the whole army go to
it—we must have it at any cost.' " Although these strictures
are, probably, over-severe, they are, unquestionably, so
far countenanced by facts ; and men of calm judgment, as
well as the most intrepid bravery, question sharply the tac-
tical wisdom which, commencing an attack with inadequate
means, is compelled to repeat it with quadruple or octuple the
forte. The failure, in the first place, they say, is attended with
a totally useless expenditure of means, and a depressing waste
' of life ; and they maintain that even the ultimate success so
achieved is diminished in value by the loss of prestige which
attended the repulse.
From the Baltic the intelligence received at the end of last
week, though not very decisive, is on the whole more en-
couraging. The destruction of a town in Finland, on the sth
instant, bears testimony to the active exertions of our fleet in
these hyperborean regions ; and the receipt of a despatch from
Admiral DIINDA.S, in which he communicates an account of a
discussion with the Russian authorities relative to the privi-
leges of flags of truce, indicates still more strongly the desire

of our enemies to depart as far as possible from the usages of
civilized war. •

While war and political changes have agitated the great
world, it is pleasing to observe that these Matters have not
entirely absorbed the general attention ; but that, on the con-
trary, elevated rank, breaking through the trammels of con-
ventional etiquette, and combining with humbler talent, has
lent a grace to seasonable benevolence. During the past week
private theatricals, for charitable objects, have occupied an in-
teresting position in the fashionable world. The drama,_ for
the nonce, forsaking the play-house, has been naturalised in
the mansions of the nobility ; and the sock and buskin have
been adjuncts to the furnishings of the drawing-room. On
Tuesday afternoon a private theatrical entertainment was
given at Grosvenor House, the proceeds of which were devoted
to help the suffering poor; and on the evening of the same
day, a dramatic entertainment, attended with the most entire
success, was given at Campden House, under the management
of Mr. CusuLas DICKENS, for the benefit of the Consumption
Hospital. On Friday, the gallery of Bridgewater House was
kindly set apart by the Earl and Countess of ELLESMERE, for
the performance of some dramatic entertainments, the pro-
ceeds to go in aid of the Hospital for Convalescents at Walton-
on-Thames, the funds of which institution have suffered severe
dilapidation through the failure of &amp;MAHAN, PAUL, and .Co.
In each of the three instances the benevolent effort@ were
crowned with gratifying success. The ordinary theatrical
world is wagging pretty much as usual. At the Haymarket,
Miss PAIICIT has made her first appearance before a London
audience in Mr. THEODORE MARTIN'S charming translation
of " King Ren6's Daughter," and has, as might have been ex-
pected, from the genuine beauty of the drama, and the parti-
cular excellence of the lady's acting in it, produced a great
sensation. It is not a little singular that, although Miss
FAIICIT has frequently enacted the chief character in this
piece with distinguished success in the provinces, she should
not, till the other night, have adventured it before the London
critics. At the St. James Theatre, the celebrated tragedienne
Itacnpr, is to appear in several of her leading characters in the
plays of Les Horaces, Phedre, and Andromaque, commencing
on the evening of this day fortnight. On the conclusion of
her engagement, she will proceed to Liverpool, whence she is
to embark for America.

In the publishing world some little stir has been created by
the appearance of "A Vindication of Major-General the Earl
of LDCAN from Lord RAGLAN'S Reflections on his Conduct in
the Action at Balaklava," which has been issued by HATCH-
ARD. In this version of the case some new points in favour
of Lord LtrcA.N have been well put, indeed, clearly esta-
blished ; particularly as it appears Lord RAGLAN changed the
arrangements previously made between Sir COLIN CAMPBELL
and Lord LucAri, whereby the command of the cavalry was
virtually taken out of his lordship's hands. I was glad to
perceive you recently made honourable mention of the Law
Book of the season, Blackstone's Commentaries by WARREN.
By the profession it is looked on as of standard excellence,
and both amateurs and professional-men will find it of inesti-
mable value at the period of a general election,. which most
parties appear to consider imminent. An unusually large
impression of it (3,000) for a law book, has been, thrown off;
and the demand for it continues large and steady. I perceive
the John Bull speaks very favourably of it. The Pori' LAu-
BEA:TB and Mr. FESTIIS BAILEY both announce new poems in
the press,- the of that by the latter to be entitled " The
Mystic." It is described as being very magnificent in its
imagety, and powerful in the postic style of its diction.
Other minstrels of less sonorous lyre are also, it is understood,
hatching•poetic broods, and, before thesere leaf of autumn,has
been shed, it is probable we shall be favoured with a consider-
able lock of APOLLO'S` fledglings.

THE REY, DR. 3P.NEILE, AFL► STREET
PREACHING.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.

Stn,—l want this after:lcon to hear the Re-.- Dr. M'lsTeile
preach, as hebad announced' his intention of doing, on the
area in front of the Exchange; and it occurred to me, on re:
turning, that r would commit Tfew thoughts to paper, for the
chance of your deeming them worthy of insertion in your
journal. I think I may claim to be an impartial witness,
inasmuch as the mooted point of street preaching was one
freely discussed by the clergy of a town with which, I was
'connected before I came to Liverpool; and some of my
brethren and myself had almost resolved upon trying the
experiment before I-left. I- am not about, then, to.eater a
wholesale protest against the practice, which seems-to be
sanctioned, at least, if 'not recommended, in that part;of the
parable of the "great- supper," in which the master of the
house is represented as saying to his servant "Go out into
the streets and lanes of the city, * * into the high ways
and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may
be filled; —and which certainly 111 a: claim i-cry high precedent,
as having been the constant habit of Christ and his Apostles.,
The questions which I wish- to solve are—Lst : How far was
the place; occupied by the Rev. Doctor this day, adapted for
carrying ,out the practice-F-2nd : To what proportion of Ids
auditors was his address likely •to prove-edifying or profitable?.
I own, knowing the strength of lungs and power of elocution
undoubtedly possessed by the Preacher, Lwas not prepared for
the difikulty, which, (in common with myself,) must have been
experienced-by at least two-thirds of the congregated mass who
were really anxious to hear what he had to, say. I gradually
`mike:buy way from the outskirts of the-multitude, to within
twenty yards,- or less, directly in front of, the platform on
which, the- Rev. Doctor was-standing ; and even at that short
distanced could only hear a few isolated words. at intervals in
each sentence. The people- about me, after rain •efforts• to
penetrate the dense phalanx which had acquired -a nearer
position, were restlessly flitting about, cr hl very audible,
murmurs expressing their- inability to bear thus rendering-
that inability still more complete, both to themselves mato
their neighbours. Meanwhile, the confused sounds from.
behind proved that vast numbers were on: the spot, on the-
most aharitabie hypothe6s, from mere curiosity, without any
wish, even, to hear a message from God, through the voice
of Ilia ambassador.

The inferences which I drew were these.: The place is" •too
large—the crowd, in numbers, is too unmanageable—and,., if
the phy*eai powers of Dr. Nl'Neile are-unable to surmount
these obstacles, no one else need attempt.to do so.
Street preaching, if it is to do any good, must have a
local aim. It must not endeavour to draw together masses
from various parts of a large town, in a space calculated to
accommodate a great multitude ; but it: must be practised in
those particular streets, courts, or alleys, in which, without
'obstruction of public thoroughfares, the preacher may have
full evereand over the audience which he has to • address,
arrest their attention, and, by the blessing of the Holy Spirit
reach their hearts. Public advertisements, ..I re.ature to'
think, will not effect this. The street Preacher, I humbly
submit, should, by personal visitation, make known, in the
locality in which he means to preach, his intention of doing
so; and should take all proper means :to prevent its being
known generally. He may reasonably expect to receive a
deferential attention from, those whom he has personally in-
vited; but, I cannot help thinking, where general publicity
has been given, the number of idlers or curioas persons, who,
will congregate together, will altogether thwart the good in,
tentions of thepreacher, and result in evil rather than good.
I say, result in,evil; for a crowd, in itself,unless under bene-
ficial control, iedisposed for mischief. Thievesand adulterers
will, perhaps invariably, mingle with it ; and assuredly a crowd,
the principal part of which cannot possibly come under the
beneficial influence which is supposed to preside over it, will
fail to derive any profit from its concentration, and will
almost certainly give occasion for the commission of much sin.
Hence, I say, if we are to have street preaching,, let us not
aim at a popular demonstration. Let us remember that labour,
diligence, and perseverance, are, ordinarily, as necessary to
insure success in our profession—that of the Christian minis-
try—as in any other ;—that we are not to look for miraculous
agencies in this age, but for a blessing in proportion to the
self-denying exertions which we personally make to secure the
end which we have in view ; and that, while preaching is a
mighty engine for good to those who are really brought under
its influence, this class will consist,—not of those who idly
congregate from motives of curiosity, or worse motives still,—
but of those, 'for the most part, who, either from education,
habit,or personal contact with God's ministers, have been
induced to become hearers of the Word.

I inclose my card for your own information ; but I have a
strong repugnance to controversy, and do not mean to enter

into it.

Should you insert this letter, and should it elicit a reply, I
have no Intention of making a rejoinder. I would only say
with St. Paul, " Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice,
yea and will rejoice."—l am, Sir, your obedient servant,

to them to desert, and that he would give them £4 a man, and
find them employment in France. He said he had already

HOUSE OF LORDS.

MONDAY.

The Royal assent was given by commission to a number of

bills.

A long discussion took place upon the presentation of a
petition from certain native inhabitants of the presidency of
Madras, praying for a change in the mode of Indian govern-
ment.

The bills on the table were advanced a stage.
The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.

HOUSE OF COMMONS.

MONDAY.

The house met at four o'clock.
Mr. Grenville Berkeley took the oaths and his seat for
Cheltenham.

The house was summoned to the House of Lords, to hear
the royal assent given by commission to a number of public
and private bills.
Lord J. Russell entered the house shortly before half-past
four o'clock, and took his seat at the back of the ministerial
benches, just below Lord Seymour.
In reply to Captain Duncombe, Sir C. WOOD said the
release of the British officers and seamen taken at Hango had
been formally demanded on the part of Her Majesty's govern-
ment, but no answer had yet been received. The prisoners,
he understood, were well treated.
Lord PALMERSTON, ill answer to a question from Mr.
Moffatt, stated that, it would not be for the interests of the
public to place the Post-office upon the same footing as the
Customs or the Excise ; and, on consideration, he saw no rea-
son for proposing such a change.
Captain DIINCOMDE asked the noble lord whether, at any
time, a subsidy was contemplated for Austria by the British
government ?
Lord PALMERSTON replied : No, Sir ! Never !
LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S EXPLANATIONS.
On the motion that the order of the day be postponed, for
the purpose of proceeding with Sir E. B. Lytton's motion,
LORD J. RUSSELL rose and said, that on Thursday last he
had stated to Lord Palmerston that he wished to retire from
office, and he had to state that Her Majesty had been pleased
to accept his resignation, and he now held office only until
his successor was appointed. He then entered at great length
into an account of his proceedings at ,Vienna, and upon his
return, observing that it was true he had promised to lay
before the Government in the most favourable manner the
propositions that had been made to him by Austria. He i
did so :in conjunction with other persons of great weight and
authority, and acted in conjunction with the Ministers of Fo-
reign Affairs for France and Turkey. He brought this proposal
to this country upon the 29th of April. On the 30th, a Cabinet
Council was held, the result of which was that the propositions
not adopted by Her Majesty's Government. He then justi-
fied his conduct in recommending the adoption of these pro-
positions, stating that the rejection of them did not alter his
opinion of their merits; and replied to Mr. Disraeli's objections,
that if they were received, there was no great issue at stake
to justify the exertions which this country was making to
carry on the war. It was because the war was necessary that
these exertions should be made, and he was the bearer
chioautedghtthtehmeyagwneitruedaetoftthhaet
peril to Turkey; he conceived the power of the project of
toifmteh
fite ptio.o
be
eo sai
Russia to be such that it was necessary, if possible, to combine
tcicoenpstedb.ecallusee appreciated
all the great powers of Europe against her, in order that peace
might be secured. Such was the foundation of his opinions—
not formed suddenly upon the merits of the proposition ; but
when Lord Westmoreland wrote, on the 16th May, a despatch
stating that the Austrian Government conceived they had
fulfilled the conditions of the treaty of December 2nd, and
that they would not make the refusal of Russia to accept the
proposition a casus belli, but only a ground for breaking off
the Conferences. When the government received that de-
spatch, tllere was no doubt, on their part, that it was not
worth their while to go into Conference to support a prove-
sition of the kind there stated? which was less favourable to

the Allies than that proposed by M. Drouyn de Lhuys, which
it was nearly certain, Russia would reject, and which Austria
would not go to war to support. From that time, therefore,
there was altogether an end to negociations with Austria
for the purpose of proposing an ultimatum to Russia,,
and that the war must be continued in order to
maintain the obeets of the Allies. It had been made a-
reproach to him by Mr. Disraeli and others, that though he
had been the bearer of the Austrian propositions, he had
spoken in favour of a vigourous prosecution of the war. He
could not see what else he could possibly do. The govern-
ment had determined that the negotiations must be put an
end to, and what other means were there left for obtaining
for a solution to the third point. The government were
quite right in not making a communication to the house of
the Austrian propositions at that time. The decision of
Austria not to interfere by force nor to move her armies upon
Russian trritory, but on the contrary to withdraw from any
participation in the the contest, and even" to diminish and..
reduce here froces having been taken, it was evident from that
moment that Russia which had been threatened, and has felt
lgpressure of the great increase of the Austrian army, feel-
What preessure taken off, would immediately feel herself
at liberty to detatch some of the best troops in her army to
the shores of the Crimea, to oppose the armies of Great Britain
and France, render these circumstances, it would have been
most unjustifiable for the government to have stated prema-
turely the decision of Austria not to propose an ultimatum to
Russia. He could not conceive a greater dereliction of duty in
such acase. The noble lord further defended his opinion in this
respect, adding that the government were united in the course
that had been taken. He further stated that when Mr. Gib-
son brought forward his question last Friday, after all that
had then occurred, he should have been totally unworthy of
his opinion if he had shrunk from meeting it with the expla-
nation which he then made. What else could he do than own
and admit the part he had taken in these transactions, He
should have been ashamed of himself if he had denied that
which he had done, and that whieh was his conscientious
opinion. The hon. baronet (Sir E. Lytton) thought that the
course he had taken was a ground for want of confidence in
the whole Administration, and he was of opinion that because
he (Lord J. Russell) held these views in May, he was incapable
of serving Her Majesty. Now that impression appeared to
preuail generally, and he consequently thought it necessary to-
tender his resignation. Lord Palmerston having taken this
course, he did not feel at all discontented with the position in
which he found himself. He saw no reason to do so. He had
always acted from what he believed to be for the benefit of the
country. He had turned over this question again and again
with a view to the public interest. He had advised that
which he thought expedient for the eountry, and, whatever
might happen, he had the satisfaction of having acted accord.
ing to his conscience-
SIR E. B. LYTTON'S MOTION.

Sir E. B. LYTTON then rose and said that, in bringing for.
ward his resolution he hoped the house would be as indulgent
to him as they had been to the noble lord, placed as he was
under the necessity of bringing forward a motioe against a
government which, but for the conduct of one of its members,
was entitled to their indulgence and commpassion. He then
proceeded to criticies the noble lord's speech, who, he said, as
a member of the government, had called upon the country to
spill its best blood in a war which he, as a negotiator, believed
unnecessary. Adverting to the Vienna correspondence, he
expressed surprise that the noble lord had not retired from
the cabinet within a week after he returned. It was surpris-
ing that the noble lord at the head of the government had not
seen that his government could not go on while its members
were so completely divided in opinion, as was apparent from
the correspondence that the Secretaay for the Colonies and the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs were wholly at variance on the
question of counterpoise. He (Sir. E. B. Lytton) gave a hearty
concurrence to the sound and healthy tone of Lord Claren-
don's correspondence, but how could Lord Palmerstone think
of going on when he contrasted the opinions of that nobleman
with those of Lord J. Russell. Was Lord Clarendon to be
considered the specimen of the Cabinet? Were they all
united—were the first Lord of the Admiralty and the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer in unison with the rest of the Cabinet
in carrying on the war ? The Cabinet was said to be united
last May, yet it was now admitted that there were differences
of opinion ; and he would remark that a discussion like this
would scarcely be excused by the plea of expediency. He
would withdraw his motion, for all its objects had been at-
tained.

Mr. BOUVERIE said that, as the motion had vanished into
thin air, he would offer a few words upon a subject personal
to himself. He had seen a statement that he was one of some
members of the government who had waited upon Lord Pal-
merston, to say that they could not resist the motion of the
hon. baaonet. The very reverse of that statement was the
truth. The fact was, that he had refused to be a party to
such a representation, upon the distinct ground of his personal
attachment to Lord J. Russell ; but he stated that, as a friend
of the noble lord, he was ready, however painful it might be,
to convey to him the general impression among his colleagues.
In this he thought he was acting as a true friend of the
noble lord—(a laugh)—and he was satisfied that his noble
friend fully appreciated the motives which led him to take
such a step. (A langh.)

THE Curative Properties of the Genuine Jamaica
SARSAPARILLA are so well known that eulogium is almost
unnecessary; but perhaps it may not be out of place to call
attention to the fact that, for nearly half a century, JOHN
PRIESTLEY'S CONCENTRATED FLUID EXTRACT have been
and still stands pre-eminent, as decidedly the most efficient and
agreeable preparation of that valuable alterative, being prepared
by a peculiar and scientific method. Nocturnal pains in the groin,
scrofulous enlargement of the glands, cutaneous affections, chronic
rheumatism, &amp;c., all speedily yield to its wonderful influence
It purifies the blood, and, by giving to the cutaneous vessels
a healthy and regular action, it rem oves that disposition to
erysipelatous inflammation from which so many persons periodi-
cally suffer ; and when taken in the spring and fall of the
year, as an alterative medicine, it will be found to impart that
strength to the constitution which is indicated by firmness of
flesh, good appetite, and freshness of the complexion.
N.B. To persons of a plethoric habit it is most invaluable, as it
thins and promotes a free circulation of the blood, thereby pre-
venting attacks of apoplexy. •

on the 18th of last month, continue to be received.
They do not much alter the general complexion of
affairs in relation to those proceedings as they have
been already stated. Some misapprehension appears
to have prevailed in reference to a sortie made by the
Russian garrison on the morning of that day, at a very
early hour, and which, according to some reports, is
said to have precipitated the French attack on the
Malakhoff, and so to have led to the disasters which
attended that attack. The discussions on this subject
have not tended in any great degree to clear up the
point, which is now of less moment. According to
the latest accounts received, the progress of the Allies
in their measured advance upon the defences of the
town have not been materially retarded by the reverses
referred to. On the contrary, they seem to be pro-
ceeding with renewed energy ; and, if we may judge
from the accounts transmitted, with a degree of su
cess which augurs ultimate and not distant triump
On Saturday, the 23rd of June, the allied position and
its neighbourhood was visited by a thunderstorm of ,
great severity, accompanied by a very heavy fall of
rain, which did a great deal of injury. All reports
concur in representing the health of the Allies as good.
Concerning the thunderstorm and the general state
of affairs,the Times correspondent, writing on the 25th,
says:

The storm which burst over the south-eastern portion of
the Chersonese on Saturday night has done more damage than
we could have anticipated. Men were drowned in ravines
converted by the tornado into watercourses, were carried off
roads by mountain torrents, and dashed against hill sides ;
beasts were swept away into the harbour and borne to sea;
huts were broken up and floated into the ocean ; the burial-
grounds near Balaklava were swept bare, and disclosed their
grim army of the dead in ghastly resurrection, washed into
strange shapes from out their shallow graves ; and, greatest
calamity of all, the railway was in various places decomposed,
ripped up and broken down, so as to be unserviceable at our
greatest need. Orders have been sent down to urge on the
necessary repairs, for the demands of the batteries for shot and
shell are pressing, and the electric telegraph has been repeatedly
in use to-day to force on the attention of the authorities at
Balaklava the necessity there is for their promptest exertions,
and to order them to send up supplies of materriel
for our fifth bombardment as speedily as possible The
French say they are quite ready, and they have
received from us 1,500 32-pound shot for their guns
to-day. The railway fails at a critical period, but even
if it were in its usual state we could not hope to be in a con-
dition to begin a heavy fire for some time to come, and I
believe it will be fully a fortnight or three weeks before the
necessary supplies will be brought up to the front. The
repairs to the railway will be effected in ten days. Mr. Beatty
and Mr. Campbell are away at Heraclea surveying the coal
district, but their representatives are men of energy, and the
only obstructions to be dreaded will arise from the " navvies,"
some of whom have been behaving very badly lately. They
nearly all " struck work" a short time back, on the plea that
they were not properly rationed or paid, or that, in other words,
they were starved and cheated ; but the provost-marshal brought
some of them to a sense of their situation, and, indeed, the
office of that active and worthy person and of his myrmidon
sergeants has been by no means a sinecure between " navvies,"
Greeks, and scoundrels, of all sorts. The Croat insurrection is
suppressed, but the Croat idleness has not been by any means
stimulated into usefulness. No wonder Col. M'Murdo finds it
difficult to get men for the Land Transport Corps, although
even he is obliged to pay 2s. 6d. and 3s. a-day to native surid-
jees, so completely have we ruined the market. The losses in
the Land Transport Corps by death would be extraordinary
did we not find a parallel to them in the •Sardinian army of
Tchorgoun, which has lost in three weeks nearly 1,000 men by
cholera, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The Turks and French en-
camped in the valley suffer somewhat from the same diseases,
but it is observable that the men who die are recruits and old
men who are mostly unacclimatized. To understand the diffi-
culties in the way of what is called at home " taking the field,"
one must come out and stay out here. It would be much easier
to take Sebastopol thanto take the field. There are only three ac-
cessible passes, up the precipitous wall of rock which rises on
the north side of the Tchernaya, to the plateau on which the
Russians are encamped, and the precipice runs round to the
Belbek. These passes are so steep that an army would have
some difficulty in ascending them at its leisure, without re-
sistance from any enemy. But they are occupied wherever
engineering eyes detect the smallest weakness—they are com-
manded by batteries, intersected by positions threatened by
everhanging cliffs all ready for the lever. March round and
turn them ! Where and how ! We have no transport even
if we could march, and we cannot march, because Napoleon
himself would never lead an army into such defiles as guards
the Russian position. Whether we are not strong enough to
detach a great corps of 40,000 or 50,000 men to operate
against the Russians north of Sebastopol is not for me to
say; but it is certain that the base of operations for any such
corps must be the sea, till ample transport is provided. The
Crimea is to all intents and purports a desert—a Sahara,
waterless and foodless before an invading army. A long train
of provisions came into Sebastopol to-day, and the mirror tele-
graph, which works by flashes from a mound over the Belbeck,
was exceedingly busy all the forenoon. Troops were also ob-
served in motion on the hills opposite Inkerman. The weather
is warm, but there is a strong breeze of wind, which tempers
its heat. The rain has developed horrible effluvia in camp,
and sickness is rather on the increase. With great regret and
surprise we heard of Captain Lyons's death this evening.
THE ARMISTICE.

Concerning the armistice, the same correspondent,
writing on the 26th, says :

The sad history of the 19th, which 1 was obliged to inter-
rupt on the departure of the mail, is soon finished. The bodies
of many a brave officer whom I knew in old times—old times
of the war, for men's lives are short here, and the events of a
life are compressed into a few hours—were borne past us in
silence, and now and then, wonderful to relate, men with severe
wounds were still living, and able to give expression to their
sufferings by moans and sighs of pain. The spirit of some of
these noble fellows triumphed over all their bodily agonies.
" General !" exclaimed a sergeant of the 18th Royal Irish to
Brigadier Eyre, as he came near the place. in the cemetery
where the poor fellow lay with both his legs broken by a round
shot; " thank God, we did our work, any way. Had I another
pair of legs, the country and you would be welcome to them !"
Many men in hospital, after losing leg or arm, said they "would
not have cared if they had only beaten the Russians." The tor-
tures endured by the wounded were very great ; they lay in
holes made by shells, and were frequently fired at by the Rus-
sian riflemen when they rolled about in their misery. Some of
our men, however, report that the enemy treated them kindly,
and even brought them water out of the embrasures. They
pulled all the bodies of our officers which lay within reach up
to the abattis, and took off their epaulettes, when they had
any, and their boots, but did not strip them. It was observed
that the ditch of the abattis was in excellent order—that the
chevaux-de-frise had been repaired, and were very strong, and
that every effort had been used up to the moment before we
assaulted to render it, as it was, a formidahle obstacle to our
advance. It is said that the bottom of the ditch was filled
with bayonets, fixed firmly in the earth; and there is a report
that the Russians were employed during the night of the 17th
in repairing the abattis itself where it was injured by our
cannon. I have already tried to describe the nature of the
ground in the front of the abattis. It was in itself a con-
siderable impediment to regularity of formation. A line of
sentries was formed by the Russians as our burying parties
came out, and they advanced so far in front of the abattis that
General Airey was obliged to ;remonstrate with an aide-de-
camp of General Osten-Sacken, who ordered them to retire
nearer to the abattis. It was observed that these men were fine
tall, muscular, and soldierlike fellows. They were unusually
well dressed, in clean new uniforms, and were no doubt picked
out to impose upon us. Many of them wore medals, and seemed
veteran soldiers. Their officers had also turned out with unusal
care, and wore white kid gloves, patent leather boots, and white
linen. The mass of the Russians were gathered on the
towering parapets of the Redan and Malakhoff, and were not
permitted to come to the front. Their working parties
brought out all our dead, and laid them in front of their line
of sentries, whence our people carried them away. The
precautions which had been taken to prevent officers and men
getting through the lines sufficed to keep any crowd away,
but the officers on duty and the lucky men, and some
amateurs, who managed to get through the lines, formed
groups in front of the Redan, and entered into con-
versation with a few of the Russian officers. There was,
however, more reserve and gravity in the interview than has
been the case on former occasions of the kind. One stout
elderly Russian of rank asked one of our officers " How are
you off for food ?" " Oh ! we get everything we want ; our
fleet secures that." " Yes," remarked the Russian, with a
knowing wink, "yes ; but there's one thing you're not so
well off for, and your fleet can't supply you, and that's
sleep." " We're at least as well off for that as you are," was
the rejoinder. Another officer, in the coarse of conversation,
asked if we really thought, after our experience of the de-
fence they could make, that we could take Sebastopol. " We
must ; France and England are determined to take it." " Ah !
well," said the other, " Russia is determined France
and England shall not have it, and we'll see who has
the strongest will, and can lose most men." In the
midst of these brief interviews, beginning and ending
with bows and salutes, and inaugurated by the concession
of favours relating to cigars and lights, the soldiers bore
dead bodies by, consigning the privates to the burial grounds
near the trenches, and carrying off the wounded and the
bodies of the officers to the camp. Poor Forman's body was
one of the first found ; it was far in advance of where he came
out of the trench with his company of the Rifle Brigade, and
it was terribly torn with shot. It was generally observed by
some of the surgeons, however, that the wounds were cleaner
than they have been in previous engagements. This is some-
what remarkable, for the Russians fired all kinds of missiles—
bags of nails and fragments of bullets, shells, and balls, as
well as grape
. and canister. They were seen as we advanced
" shovelling" the shot into the muzzles of the guns. No
one can deny many of the officers the praise of extreme
bravery and devotion. In the midst of our fire they got up
oil the top and on the outside of the parapets, and directed
the fire of their men upon us. Several of them were knocked
over by round shot, shell, and rifle balls, while exposing them-
selves in this manner, but it scarcely speaks well for their
soldiers that they felt it necessary to set them such examples.
Colonel Dickson succeeded in obtaining Lord Raglan's per-
mission to open on the Russians from the 21-gun battery, and
swept them away in numbers as they crowded out to fire on
our broken columns and on our wounded men and fugitives.
The armistice lasted for upwards of two hours, and when it
was over we retired from the spot so moistened with our
blood.
RETENTION OP THE CEMETERY.
All the advantage we gained by the assault was the capture
of the Cemetery, and even that we had nearly abandoned,
owing to the timidity of
the
eof our generals. As you have
already learnt, the men in Cemetery and houses suffered
severely during the
18th t om. the enemy's fire, and the
soldiers in the latter were not able to withdraw till nightfall.
It was left to one of the Generals of Division to say what
should be done with the Cemetery, and he gave orders to
abandon it. On the following morning an officer of Engineers,
Lieutenant Donnelly, heard to his extreme surprise that the
position for which we had paid so dearly was not in our
possession. Re appreciated ita value—he saw that the

Russians bad not yet advanced to re-occupy it. With the
utmost zeal and energy he set to work among the officers in
the trenches, and begged and borrowed some 30 men with
whom he crept down into the Cemetery, just before the flag
of truce was hoisted. As soon as the armistice began the
Russians flocked down to the Cemetery, which they supposed
to be undefended, but to their great surprise they found our 30
men posted there as sentries, who warned them back, and in the
evening the party was strengthened, and we are now construct-
ing most valuable works and batteries there, in spite of a heavy
fire, which occasions us considerable loss. Such is the storythat
is going the round of the camp. Lord Raglan is said to have
found fault with General Eyre for -losing SO many men, but
the latter observed, that he had done what he was .ordered,
and that he had taken the Cemetery. There can be no doubt
but that our troops could have got into the town in the rear
of the Redan from the houses on the 18th, had they been
strong enough to advance from the Cemetery. Whether they
could have maintained themselves there under the fire of forts,
ships, and batteries, is another question. It is now shrewdly
suspected that inside the Redan, behind those outward and
visible walls of earth, there is another very strong work—a
kind of star fort of earth with sunken batteries—and it is
certain that inside the Malakoff works there are several lines
of battery which have never been unmasked. The enemy
have probably constructed large funnel-shaped pits behind
these works, into which shells roll and burst, as such a " dodge"
was found in the Mamelon. Inside the latter work were
splendid bombproofs for the men to retire into when our fire
became hot. They were large pits with 10 feet of earth, and
beams of wood across them, and were capable of holding a
strong body of men. In one some new sacks marked with
the broad arrow and B. 0. were found, in which were packets
of cartridges ready for use. Where did these sacks come
from P It is almost as strange as the English bread found at
Tchorgoun. There is talk of a spy being taken, or rather
discovered, in a sub-interpreter to the Commissariat, who
confesses he has been in communication with the Russians,
and revealed our attack to them. He will be shot, if this be
true.

At its early sitting, the house went into committee on the
Nuisances Removal Amendment Bill. After considerable dis-
cussion, the different clauses of the bill were disposed of, and on
the proposal of Sir B. HALL, some new clauses were agreed to
without discussion.—On the motion of Mr. HORSPALL, a clause
was adopted which provides that, on the certificate of the
medical officer to the local authority that any house was over-
crowded, proceedings might be taken to abate such overcrowd-
ing.—The house then resumed, and the Chairman reported the
bill to the house.
Mr. HOLLAND took the oaths and his seat for the borough
of Evesham, in the room of Mr. C. G. Berkeley, who had ac-
cepted the lailtern Hundreds.

The house adjOi;ned at four o'clock.
The evening sitting commenced at six o'clock. After the
discussion of some matters of routine, comprising a few re-
marks on the Turkish Loan, the subject of
THE AUSTRIAN PROPOSALS and Sir E. B. Lytton's motion
regarding Lord John Russell's share in the negotiations for
peace were introduced by Lord PALMERSTON, who brought up
Papers connected with the late negotiations at Vienna, and in
moving that they be laid on the table observed that the go-
vernment could not consent to the motion of which notice had
been given by Mr. Disraeli (to give precedence that day to Sir
B. B. Lytton's motion over the orders of the day), since the
Papers he had then presented could not be in the hands of
members in time for the discussion.—Lord J. RUSSELL, refer-
ring to an inquiry made by Mr. Disraeli in his absence on
Tuesday, explained what he did say did not require the sanc-
tion of Her Majesty, which had, however, since been given.—
Mr. DISRAELI did not see that the statement of Lord John
at all changed the state of things. What had disquieted
the country was, that it should have come out on his
part that he had returned to England with a project of pacifi-
cation of which he approved, and which he recommended
to his colleagues, and, on their refusal to adopt it, he had
come down to the house, and made a speech which conveyed
to the country that he was an uncompromising advocate of
the war, leaving an impression upon Parliament and the
nation utterly inconsistent with the facts. If he received an
assurance that there should be a full discussion of this im-
portant issue on Monday, he would not press his motion.—
Lord PALMERSTON said his object in deferring the discussion
was to give time for the papers to be read ; and, if it suited
the convenience of Sir B. Lytton, he should be prepared to
take the discussion, from which the government had no wish
to shrink, on Monday.—Sir E. B. LYTTON assented to this
proposal.

Mx. ROEBVCX'S MOTION. —ln answer to a questions fir.

ROEBUCK said he believed that he should meet the wishes of
the house by postponing his motion.

I Lord PALMERSTON, in reply to Mr. Hutt, said the papers
did not include a copy of the circular of Count Buol, which was
not in the possession of the government. The motion was
agreed to.

-The Education (Scotland) Bill was passed on a division by
a majority of 130 to 115.
A protracted discussson ensued in regard to a deputation of
Irish members on the Tenants' Improvement Compensation
DisRAELr complained of the way in which the busi-
ness of the house was conducted.—Lord PALMERSTON disputed
the accuracy of the charge.—This subject led to a long discus-
sion, in which no small degree of acrimony mingled, suggestions
being thrown out that the intercourse between the Irish depu-
tation and the Government was not altogether unconnected
with the impending motion of Sir B. Lytton.—At a quarter
to one o'clock, the Chairman was ordered to report progress,
though none whatever had been made in the bill. •

Lady Raglan and Lord Raglan's AnnUitie; Bill passed
through committee.
The Coal Mines Inspection Bill was read a third time, and
after some discussion passed.
The remaining business having been disposed of, the House
adjourned at a quarter to 2 o'clock.

G.C.8., which melancholy event took place a little before nine
o'clock on the evening of Thursday last, the 28th instant ; his
Lordship expired without any suffering in the midst of the
officers composing his personal staff.
I have further to report that, being the next senior officer
present, I have assumed the command of this army until
instructions shall arrive from England.—l have, &amp;c.,

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.

HOUSE OF LORDS.

TUESDAY.

Mlle meeting of the House, Lord STIAFTESBURY stated,
that, at the urgent request of the Bishops of London and
Oxford, he should postpone his bill until Monday, the 16th.
THE MASSACRE AT HANGO.—The Earl of MALMESBURY
directed attention to the despatch of General de Berg, vindi-
cating the massacre at Hango. He requested to know what
course government intended to pursue in the matter.—The
Earl of CLARENDON said the letter referred to was most
unsatisfactory, and added that Admiral Dundas had been
ordered to demand the immediate release of the prisoners.
A communication had also been made, through the Danish
government, on the subject, with the Russians. Till answtrs
to these demands had been received, government could not say
what course it would adopt.—Lord CAMPBELL said there
could be no doubt that the Russians had been guilty of a
most flagrant breach of the law of nations.—Lord COLCHESTER,
without offering any excuse for the Russians, expressed a
hope that this event would render our naval officers more
careful in communicating with the enemy by flags of truce.
In answer to a question from the Earl of Malmesbury, Lord
CLARENDON said there were grounds for hoping that a cartel
for the exchange of prisoners will speedily be arranged.
The Victoria Government Bill was read a second time.
THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.—The Marquis of CLAN-
RICARDE moved for a return of all persons employed in the
diplomatic service, and expressed an opinion that the attacks
so frequently made on that branch of the public service were
unfair and unfounded.—The Earl of CLARENDON had no ob-
jection to the production of the returns.—Lord GRANVILLE
took the occasion to defend himself from some attacks which
had been made upon him in the Lower House with regard to
certain diplomatic appointments made by him when Foreign
Minister.—Lord MALMESBURY deprecated any attempt to
remove the patronage of the Foreign-office from the control of
the Foreign Minister for the time being.—The returns were
then agreed to, and the matter dropped.
Some other business was despatched, after which their
lordships adjourned.

_
THURSDAY.
Their lordships had only a short sitting, in the course
of which they forwarded several bills a stage.—ln the early
part of the sitting, Lord LYNDHURST withdrew his Oath of
Abjuration Bill.

HOLLOWAY'S PILLS.

ASTONISHING CURE OF DROPSY.
Copy of a Letter from Mr. David Simpson, of Collingliam, dated
4th Sept., 1854.
To Professor Holloway,—Sir,—lt is with great pleasure I hare
to inform you of a most wonderful cure of that dreadful malady,
the dropsy, effected on my daughter by the use of your invalu-
able pills. She had been under medical treatment for a long
time without deriving any benefit, although she was tapped
twice, and fourteen pounds of water taken from her each time.
After suffering very severely for some time, -she finally had re-
course to your pills, and in four weeks was completely cured, after
every other remedy failed to do her the slightest good. I there-
fore feel bound to make this statement public for the benefit of
similar sufferers.—l remain, sir, yours obediently,
(Signed) DAVID SIMPSON.
WONDERFUL CURE -OF ASTHMA.
Copy of a Letter from Itiir. Joseph Wild, of Hyde, Cheshire,

dated the sth of August, 1.554. •
To Professor Holloway,— Sir, mrs. Newton (a lady well
known in this town, residing in Hanover street) wns afflicted
for years with a severe attack of asthma ; difficulty of breathing,
and a most violent cough, causing severe pains in her side, parti-
cularly when she took cold; she tried many remedies, and con-
sulted different individuals, without deriving any benefit. At last
she came to me, and I advised her to take your pills and use
your ointment ; after a few weeks, by perseverance with your
remedies, she was considerably better, and, by continuing the
same, in three months she was perfectly cured.—l remain, yours,
&amp;c. (Signed) Jos. WILD.
INDIGESTION AND BILIOUSNESS ! EXTRAORDINARY
CURE ! !
Copy of a Letter from Mr. James Henshall, of Ashton-under-
_

Lvne, dated 28th June. 1854.
To IProfessor Holloway,—Sir,—l was seriously afflicted with
indigestion, attended with frequent sickness, loss of appetite
giddiness, headache, drowsiness, and dimness of sight, an op-
pression at the pit or the stomach, and the other attendant evils
of a generally disorganised constitution. Although I tried a
variety of reputed remedies, I was not benefited, and finally I be-
came so bad that life was almost insupportable to me. At this
period I commenced using your pills, and in gratitude am bound
to confess. that after a few doses I felt considerably better, and
in six weeks was radically cured by this medicine alone, after
every other remedy had failed to afford me the slightest relief.
(Signed) JAS. HENSHALL.

mind, particularly as that was measured in comparison
with some of her predecessors, was, nevertheless, finely
imbued with many of the womanly feelings and truly
feminine virtues to which they were strangers. From
the moment she figures in the pages of this book, the
reader becomes familiar with an improved tone in the
morals and a purer air in the narrative. That both
George 111. and his Queen were of simple and unos-
tentatious habits, is too well known to require authen-
tication ; and it is also known that both of them
evinced considerable partiality for the sect of Quakers,
whose simplicity of manners seemed akin to their own;
but it may not be so extensively familiar to our readers
that, among the first visits of the youthful Queen
Charlotte, accompanied by her royal husband, on their
visits to London, was one to the house of a Quaker ;
nevertheless, so it was. After passing, as Dr. Doran
graphically delineates them, the various city formalities
at Temple Bar and St. Paul's Churchyard, the royal
pair proceeded, not to Guildhall, but to the house of
Robert Barclay, patent medicine vendor, ancestor to the
head of the firm of Barclay, Perkins, and Co. Robert,
who was in his eightieth year; was the only surviving
son of that Robert Barclay who wrote the celebrated
" Apology for the Quakers," and who was also a pro-
genitor of the famous Captain Barclay, the noted pe-
destrian and zealous patron of athletic sports. The
occasion of the royal visit to the city was a "Lord
lifayor;slpa,P,:: and- the -prefercnce apcorded to-- the
.Qtt,akers,Transion appears haie been higklappre-
ciaed"by' "'the hearty old man," -who had keviously
enterlained.both- the preceding Georges, and also' by
his family. Of this. fact Dr. Doran gives interesting
testimony in the following

ACCOUNT OF A ROYAL VISIT, BIC A QUAKERR3B.

Queen Charlotte and George 111, were the last of our sove-
reigns who thus honoured a Lord Mayor's show. And as it
was the last oceasion, and that the young Queen Charlotte was
the heroine of the day, the opportunity may be profited by to
show how the royal lady looked and bore herself in the estima-
tion of one of the Miss Barclays, whose letter descriptive of
the scene appeared about forty-seven years subiequently, in
1803. The following extracts are very much to our purpose
:
"About one o'clock papa and mama, with sister Western, to
attend them, took their stand at 'the street-door, where my
two brothers had long been to receive the nobility, more
than a hundred •of whom were then waiting in the ware-
house. As the royal family came, they were conducted into
one of the counting-houses, which was transformed into a very
pretty parlour. At half-past two their majesties came, which
was two hours later than they had intended. On the second
pair of stairs was placed our own company, about forty. in
number, the chief of whom were of the Puritan order, and all
in their orthodox habits. Next to the drawing-room doors
were placed our own selves, I mean papa's children, none else,
to the great mortification of visitors, being allowed to enter :-
for as kissing the- king's hand without' kneeling was an un-
exampled honour, the king confined that privilege to our own
family, as a retiirn'for, the trouble we had been-at. After the
royal pair had shown themselves at the balcony, we were all
introduced, and you may believe, at that juncture, we felt 'no
small palpitations. The king met us at the danr, (a condel-
cension I did not eipect,) at which place he saluted us with
great politeness. Advancing to the upper -end of the room,
we kissed the queen's hand, at the sight of whom we were all
in raptures, not only front the brilliancy of her appearance,
Which was pleasing beyond description, but being througheut
her whole person possessed of that inexpressible something
that is beyond a set of features, and equally claims our atten-
tion. To be sure, she has not a fine face, but a most agreeable
countenance, and is vastly genteel, with an air, notwithstanding
her being a little woman, truly majestic; and I really think,
by her manner is expressed. that complacency of disposition
which is truly amiable ; and though I could, never perceive
that she deviated from that dignity which belongs to a crowned
head, yet on the most trifling occasions she displayed all that
easy behaviour that negligence can bestow.l Her hair, which
is of alight colour, hung in what is called coronation-ringlets,
encircled in a band of diamonds, so beautiful in themselves, and
so prettily disposed, as will admit of no description. Her
clothes, which were as rich as gold, silver, and silk could make
them, was a suit from which fell a train supported by a little
page in scarlet and silver. The lustre of her stomacher was
inconceivable. The king I think a very personable man. All
the princes followed the king's example in complimenting each
of us with a kiss. The queen was up stairs three times, and

holders do not press the market. Pork also remains dull and
lifeless, without change in value. In bacon the transactions are
on a very trilling scale; the dealers still hold off, but the light
stock prevents prices giving way. For lard there is less inquiry,
and the sales for the week do not reach 100 tons. The condition
of the cheese lately arrived is not satisfactory, hence sales are
difficult to effect. Grease butter is saleable in small quantities
only. Tallow early in the week was active, but is now dull.

sid to 6jd, mutton from 50 to 6id per lb. Cattle, 1,202 ; sheep
and lambs, 17,199.

THERE is not a red coat idAthlone garrison, which has not
occurred since the days of Cromwell. The garrison is now oc-
cupied by the Westmeath and Longford, both rifle Corps.
MILITARY COLLEGE FOR IRELAND.-The Dublin Evening
Mail gives currency to a report which appeared in an Irish
provincial journal, that the_ Queen's College, Galway, being
found nearly useless for the purposes it was originally designed
for, is about to be converted into an institution of military
education.

CHIEF
.JUSTICE LEFROY.-7A rumour has prevailed in
Dublin for the last few days, to the effect that Chief Justice
Lefroy is about to obtain a peerage, and to make way for the
elevation of the Attorney-General to the Chief Justiceship.
The Freeman's Journal throws some doubt upon the accuracy
of the report. •
" THE PRESBYTERIAN REPRESENTATION .SOCIETY."-An
important political movement has been set on foot among the
Irish Presbyterians, who took advantage of the recent General
Assembly at Dublin to hold a meeting of ministers, elders,
and laymen, for the purpose of forming an association, to be
called The Presbyterian Representation Society," having
for its object the election of members of the Presbyterian body
as parliamentary representatives.
FLOGGING Ix THE MILITIA..-It was stated by the Galway
Express that a stripling soldier of the North Mayo Militia has
been flogged at Castlebar for drunkenness. It is added, that
the punishment was administered on a Sunday Who is the
officer in command of the North Mayo Militia at Castlebar ?
It behoves him to declare him Self, and to deny at once this
latter statement, if lie can deny it; for, of course, it is' out of
the nature of things, in the present day, for any man to con-
tinue to hold a commission in Her Majesty's service who may
have been guilty of so flagrant and violent a profanation. It
is, indeed, difficult to believe that any officer, however fire-new
his dignity, could expect to brave public opinion by converting
the day of sacred rest into a day of infamy and torture, after
the well remembered explosion of popular indignation at a
similar outrage, some few years ago, in the Seventh Light
Dragoons.--Evening

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>This dataset contains text extracted at the article level from historic digitised newspapers from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bl.iro.bl.uk/collections/9a6a4cdd-2bfe-47bb-8c14-c0a5d100501f?locale=en">Heritage Made Digital</a> newspaper digitisation program at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a>. The newspapers in the dataset were published between 1800 and 1896. This dataset contains ~2.5 billion tokens and 3,065,408 articles. </p>
<p>The dataset contains text generated from Optical Character Recognition software on digitised newspaper pages. This dataset includes the plain text from the OCR alongside some minimal metadata associated with the newspaper from which the text is derived and OCR confidence score information generated from the OCR software. </p>

<p>This dataset can be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>historical research and digital humanities research</li>
<li>training language models</li>
<li>training historic language models</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this dataset can be used for all of these tasks, it is important to understand that the dataset was not constructed in a representative way so it contains biases in terms of the newspapers and articles that are included (more on this below). </p>

<p>The text in this dataset is in English that has been recognised by the OCR software. The OCR software used is generic commercial OCR software that has not been trained on historic newspapers. There are therefore many errors in the text. Some of the OCR in this text will be of such poor quality that is is incomprehensible to a human reader.</p>

		Curation Rationale
	</span>
</h3>
<p>This dataset consists of public-domain newspapers published in the UK during the 19th Century. The majority of newspapers digitised in the UK are not freely available (even if they are out of copyright). The newspapers in this dataset were digitised specifically to be freely available but also to meet preservation goals for newspapers in poor condition. As a result, the newspapers chosen for digitisation are biased toward poor quality physical newspapers. This may in turn result in worse OCR.</p>
