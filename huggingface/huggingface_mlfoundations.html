Otherwise, the disk has always been read-only, there is no built-in NTFS write support in OS X. –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 15:36\nadd comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nYou are getting the read-only file system error because on OS X NTFS is natively read-only. It was read-only before your Time Machine run in, and will stay that way unless you install a third-party driver, such as Tuxera NTFS.\n\nDisk Utility's built-in repair commands are merely a GUI front-end for fsck and fsck_hfs. They are not meant to be used on an NTFS-formatted disk.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nthank you for this response, but if they are not meant for NTFS-formatted disks, then, what should I do? –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 15:15\nDo you have a Windows install handy? –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 15:16\nnope, I haven't ( –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 15:18\nThis is great mystery why I've used to write to this disk previously, but it looks like you are absolutely right, NTFS is not fully supported on MacOS. Your answer gave me a hint, so I believe it should be accepted. –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 16:46\nthanks. i wish you luck –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 19:43\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66593/how-to-enable-repair-disk-button?answertab=votes&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.11255168914794922,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.112552&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:24,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;24&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9794756770133972\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;85841\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:FT7YYWMBNB6MG6SXZ7JI5NRSFUZ5O57G\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:c078c4b7-6d55-4814-b77d-c34796fd67cd>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:21:57\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;66.114.52.19\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:EUGPTBTQ44RGCSRJWMUJCHJSUJY26W4P\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:60773c7a-c2b3-4586-904a-9a081aef57ed>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/25/books/bk-29869/2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:835,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;835&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;YOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollections\n(Page 2 of 4)\n\nKicking Out the Jams\n\nThe Trials and Triumphs of Barney Rosset's Grove Press\n\n\nThese same conditions were to give rise in the spring of 1970 to a conflict that marked the end of Grove's decade of remarkable success. A dissident group of employees sought to unionize the company, and a disciplined cell of feminists demanded veto power over Grove's editorial policy. The machinists' union quickly signed up half a dozen editorial workers, all of whom Rosset promptly fired. The women had other goals, including 24-hour free child care, for all profits from books written by black authors to be \&quot;returned\&quot; to the black \&quot;community\&quot; and for all profits from erotic books to be used to establish a defense fund for prostitutes. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the feminists occupied the executive offices at Grove and mounted a press campaign that made network television news. Rosset refused to acquiesce in what he saw as censorship and had them forcibly removed by the police. He had sat on his own sword.\n\nThe union lost the vote among the employees, but the demands of the radicals remained morally divisive. How could a man who had been a Communist in his youth, one who held in contempt any social policy that interfered with the freedom of the artist or the individual, not accede to the values of the women's movement? The writers and film-makers who saw in Grove a haven for expression and experimentation became disaffected. Readers, 200,000 of whom bought Evergreen Review every month and who sought out new books from Grove simply because they were published by Grove, began to desert the company.\n\nThese events, coupled with declining revenues from the film division and the excessive cost of renovating a new office building, combined to jeopardize Grove's financial future. But, more important, by the early 1970s, Grove's captive audience had been fractured. Books and magazine articles that only Grove would have published a scant five years earlier were now seen as safe commercial ventures by larger, more conventional houses, and Grove, at a moment of capital scarcity, was forced to compete with publishers who had far more money available to invest.\n\nWhen I joined Grove in 1969, the company employed 140 people and had just moved into a lavishly restored office building at the corner of Bleecker and Mercer streets. Four years later, there were 14 of us working out of Rosset's home on West Houston Street, after an interim stopover on East 11th Street in a small building that housed a miniature movie theater and the Black Cat bar, which Rosset operated on the financially dubious policy of never charging friends or employees for their drinks.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Grove lived on the income generated by its marvelous backlist. There was the occasional new book of note, even the rare momentary best-seller. But the halcyon days were gone, along with the money. Rosset's instinct had been to make Grove into what we would now call a multimedia company. And instinct it was, as his view of the future was always a bit light on planning or details and, later, on resources. He wanted a company that could publish a magazine to support its books and discover new writers, to run a book club that offered publications and short films (most of them in aggressive violation of just about everybody's \&quot;community standards\&quot;) via the mail, so as to circumvent the regular, stodgy channels of distribution. He entered the feature film business to distribute movies such as Jean-Luc Godard's \&quot;Weekend\&quot; and the seminal, if banal, \&quot;I Am Curious (Yellow).\&quot; These and other films were, Rosset understood, a natural extension of the publishing operation (a number of them were made by Grove authors such as Marguerite Duras).\n\nHis idea of what America's future could aspire to--racial tolerance, free sexual expression--was based on morality and an acute sense of history. That some of his ideas were not much more than mental curlicues and that some of his behavior was awfully self-centered does not detract from his ethical impulse.\n\nAmerica has traveled some distance since the mid-1950s. Today it looks a lot more like what Rosset wanted it to be than it resembles the social order championed by those who would have delighted in attending his auto-da-fe. For his view of the future was not a \&quot;vision\&quot;; it was concrete, something one could stake reputation and private fortune on, which is what he did.\n\nAn inveterate child of the 1930s, he was a man whose true thoughts and emotions were closer to those of a precocious 16-year-old than to those of the charming sophisticate one first met. Rosset needed money but disdained what he believed it represented, as when, after his father's death, he sued the state of Illinois to return a prized charter to operate a private bank.\n\nLos Angeles Times Articles&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/25/books/bk-29869/2&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.01924765110015869,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.019248&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9779581427574158\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;83835\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:OTALA5RTL2K3HUC2EXYYYPZDTUQG42B5\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:14d106c2-637a-40fd-9945-6853a8a742ff>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:18:32\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;174.35.22.81\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:OCLMKGL7UALUKATV2EMRYDIG5MVBDDPH\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:41fd605a-e778-4d79-891b-553d964ab41e>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/25/local/la-me-lausd-charters-20110725/2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:338,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;338&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;YOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollectionsEducation\n(Page 2 of 2)\n\nHigh turnover reported among charter school teachers\n\nWith so many charter school teachers moving on each year, concerns arise about retaining quality educators and how stability affects student performance.\n\nJuly 25, 2011|By Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times\n\nKavita Papneja, a math teacher, joined an Alliance College-Ready charter several years ago and doesn't regret it. In her prior work at a traditional school, Gompers Middle School near Watts, \&quot;you have more behavior issues,\&quot; she said. \&quot;Here, most of the time, we just have to worry about what we are teaching and what kids are learning.\&quot;\n\nAs far as the charter workload, \&quot;if I have to spend extra hours, I will,\&quot; said Papneja, 43, who believes she's the oldest teacher in her school. \&quot;It's not like they force me.\&quot;\n\nShe and history teacher Stephanie McIlroy, who joined Alliance at age 21, also left a charter school; but in their case, the purpose was to follow Principal Howard Lappin from one Alliance charter school to a newly opened charter, the Alliance Environmental Science and Technology High School in Glassell Park.\n\nSome former teachers at Alliance schools and elsewhere were less enthusiastic, speaking of pressure to produce high test scores and arbitrary management.\n\n\&quot;We got in trouble for taking our sick days and personal days,\&quot; said a history teacher who entered the teaching profession at a charter while in her 20s. She requested anonymity because she recently accepted a position at a different charter school. \&quot;Teachers feel so beleaguered because everything is presented to us as a problem we have to solve. But we can't fix all those problems, like when a kid misses 60 days in a semester.\&quot;\n\nDespite her former school's solid test scores, she said, the teacher departures matter.\n\n\&quot;It has a huge effect on student morale,\&quot; she said, especially for students who lack needed stability in other parts of their lives. \&quot;By the time students graduated from my school, there was not a single teacher who had been there the whole time.\&quot;\n\nLos Angeles Times Articles&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/25/local/la-me-lausd-charters-20110725/2&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.052737534046173096,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.052738&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9382619857788086\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;61769\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:O62W52EPMTRDM7TLTF2EUN6LW7D55B7S\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:55042cfb-1487-48d0-9c6a-04e8c186c250>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:49:13\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.24\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:VW3U6F6VXBN4HTCLVDUXUJ6IZWNOHWRV\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:a57efb1b-c977-4b38-8f2a-4aefb27e00ac>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/114277/ubuntu-doesnt-boot-without-flash-drive\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:268,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;268&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nI just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Netbook.

Either tell your BIOS to boot from the other drive, or reinstall, and make sure you direct grub to the correct drive.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/114277/ubuntu-doesnt-boot-without-flash-drive&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.08555358648300171,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.085554&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9032000303268432\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;67694\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:RQ6SOPJA2YNCZB3OVXOCKTN3M4DTJX5V\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:9b5d55fb-dc54-425e-81a1-4e4603c0f93f>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:48:58\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.24\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:BJUTLRI5BGKNJ4RJ4JBTHTLSITEI3T53\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:795444e7-6940-4da3-8c8c-6e24408a96ed>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/149632/ubuntu-no-boot-logo\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:502,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;502&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nWhen I used the exe file to install it it works on first start.

The fix has nothing to do with which gpu you have. If you can get to the log in screen your gpu is working. The reason that you have no splash screen is that the new kernels load so fast that the DRIVERS load after the rest of the system. This fix will get the system to wait for the graphic driver to load, hence allowing you to see the boot screen or any boot messages if you Esc. the splash screen. The system will boot slightly slower with this fix but if you have a fairly new system you will not notice the difference. –  TrailRider Jun 13 '12 at 21:39\nUnless I misunderstood your initial question. after you installed you didn't see the boot screen but went to the log-in screen, you were able to log in and run Ubuntu correct?? If so then Ubuntu is installed and you can use this fix to get the boot screen to show again. –  TrailRider Jun 13 '12 at 21:48\nYes i dont see the boot screen but I am able to go on the login screen i was just wondering if I can get the boot screen –  winter4w Jun 14 '12 at 3:57\nThen this should work for you. –  TrailRider Jun 14 '12 at 22:48\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/149632/ubuntu-no-boot-logo&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.04292702674865723,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.042927&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.940073549747467\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;63438\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:PDBJDJTN3ZPMJT2I2PQQITWVCBWGVE56\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:ead427f6-865b-4793-9670-be48e8a853f8>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:18:16\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.24\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:AIFGV7FUSUG5WAG5IRXMAFQ3JG6NRJKL\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:15f49e8d-f6c5-4ac3-a6ed-60592932190b>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/161794/secure-is-installation-of-ubuntu-or-should-be-dual-with-windows\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:486,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;486&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nI have used ubuntu for almost 6 months full time at home while using windows for almost 6 years,so I previously used ubuntu on separate hard drive while I have one attached hard drive with partitions having NTFS file system so I used data from those partitions also. Now I want to again shift to ubuntu as I am a web developer and want to use ubuntu and I have a hp probook. So I just want to know few things:\n\nShould I use wubi? But I have heard it is on windows installtion mercy still that is not good. Should I use dual boot and configure it separately without any wubi e.t.c.? Or should I install separate ubuntu on whole hard disk?\n\nIt seems like 3rd option is good but main concern in that case is that how will my data be safe? Like if my ubuntu is corrupted or need to install again or uninstall in any case, then I will need to format whole disk and all my data will be deleted as it is on unpartitioned space. So this seems to be unsafe. Actually I am not sure, but another option I have is to have some partitions and some unpartitioned space and install ubuntu on unpartitioned space and if I will remove ubuntu at some time or it will be removed some how then I will have my data safe in partitioned space. The way I am thinking really make sense? I have been actually windows user so may be thinking in that way, and want to know that how mostly people use ubuntu while feeling safe about their data. What is best way to use ubuntu?\n\nPlease tell whatever you know so that I can understand the way better. thanks\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nI would definitely recommend the third choice.\n\nLike you said, the first choice is bad since you're basically running within Windows. The second choice is alright, but if you can run Ubuntu on a separate HDD that would be best in my opinion.\n\nIf Ubuntu gets corrupted, there's no need for you to format the drive or partitions before recovering your data. If you're going to be running Windows as well, you can access the Linux partitions, granted that you don't encrypt them (if you do I'm sure you still can I just don't know how)\n\nWIndows 7 can natively read Ext2, 3 and 4. If you're using an earlier version of Windows you can download and use ext2fsd to view the linux partitions.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/161794/secure-is-installation-of-ubuntu-or-should-be-dual-with-windows&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.07763218879699707,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.077632&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:20,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;20&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9083393216133118\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;74312\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:GRFDTDG7O5CNI5TKUDPGVRJ26CTY2TJM\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:acab9236-12ee-4c70-b402-89ef0915ed3b>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:55:53\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.24\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:BOWXCMTP24MKOMIGPWZAXVWZP66BPQNP\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:381681b1-87da-448f-87bd-523ff68091e2>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/45799/lan-between-2-ubuntu-11-04-os-installed-computers/45812\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:747,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;747&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nI have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on 2 of my desktops PC's.

But if you simply want Internet connection / local file sharing:\n\nWith the computer you are connecting to your router:\n\nClick on your network indicator (top right of your screen...) and select 'Edit Connections'. In the wired tab hit the button 'Add'. Give the connection a helpful name, and under the 'IPv4 Settings' tab choose \&quot;Shared to other computers\&quot; in the drop down 'Method' box. Save the chances and close the connection editor. Connected this computer to the Internet.\n\nConnected up the second machine. On the first 'internet'ed' machine just make sure (using the network indicator) that the Wired Connection you've just created is chosen.\n\nThis GUI method should be able to cope with most more-complex setups too.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAs I have understood, both computers are directly connected to the router.

You want to create a python program to capture those?\n\nWell, Ask Ubuntu is not a programmer's QA, and software development is a bit beyond the scope, but here is a little code I did do capture notification bubbles:\n\nimport glib\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndef notifications(bus, message):\n    if message.get_member() == \&quot;Notify\&quot;:\n        print [arg for arg in message.get_args_list()]\n\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\n\nmainloop = glib.MainLoop()\n\nLeave this running in a terminal, then open another terminal window and test it:\n\nnotify-send --icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png \&quot;My Title\&quot; \&quot;Some text body\&quot;\n\nAnd the program will output this:\n\n[dbus.String(u'notify-send'), dbus.UInt32(0L), dbus.String(u'/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png'), dbus.String(u'My Title'), dbus.String(u'Some text body'),...\n\nAs you may have guessed, message.get_args_list()[0] is the sender, [2] for icon, [3] for summary and [4] for body text.\n\nFor the meaning of the other fields, check the official specification docs\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/89279/listening-to-incoming-libnotify-notifications-using-dbus&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.2726505994796753,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.272651&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9504460096359252\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;69711\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:B55WW2VDC7USIODWBXAZ2674N26V6KO6\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:c04d12e3-f625-4542-a195-df5859200b0e>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:34:10\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;23.23.134.171\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:3SRWCSZXRIRO53WG5P67LGEVOMT6S23N\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:3caec430-a420-483f-a790-3e0f983a9874>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/413758-why-would-lebron-james-ever-want-to-come-to-new-jersey\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:384,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;384&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Why Would LeBron James Ever Want To Come to New Jersey?\n\nUse your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories\nWhy Would LeBron James Ever Want To Come to New Jersey?\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nLooking at LeBron James' free agency options, why the heck would he want to come to Jersey?\n\nFor one, the team just got out of their arena that existed on a swamp, which basically describes what people think of when they think of New Jersey (unfairly so).\n\nThe Nets won 12 games in 2009-2010. If it were me, the Nets' situation wouldn't seem very appealing, and that's coming from a Nets fan.\n\nBut here's the thing that's keeping the New Jersey Nets in the hunt—mystique.\n\nThe Nets have a new Russian owner, music mogul Jay-Z, and two great players in Devin Harris and Brook Lopez. On top of that, they just drafted Derrick Favors and Damion James.\n\nDoesn't sound like a 12-win team, does it?\n\nPlus, the Nets are moving to Newark this season (not that Newark's all that enticing), but the Nets have the aura of Brooklyn in the future.\n\nLeBron won't have to wait long until he gets to Brooklyn, which is just as good as Manhattan in certain ways.\n\nSure, he could go to L.A. and play for the Clippers, but I think the Clips may be the one team whose name rings a more sour bell than the Nets.\n\nAnd barring a shocking move, I doubt he'll stay in Cleveland.\n\nYes, he could go to Chicago, Dallas, or Miami and party it up, but those cities aren't New York.\n\nAnd as for the Knicks, who do play in New York, their core somehow manages to be worse off than that of the 12-win Nets.\n\nWith all of that being said, I still think it would be a wild card if LeBron landed with the Nets.\n\nBut it could happen. Is it a long shot? Yes. But is it possible? Definitely.\n\nWho knows, maybe LeBron will surprise us and take a bite out of the Big Apple...I mean New Jersey.\n\nLoad More Stories\n\nFollow Brooklyn Nets from B/R on Facebook\n\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nWe will never share your email address\n\nThanks for signing up.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/413758-why-would-lebron-james-ever-want-to-come-to-new-jersey&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1930977702140808,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.193098&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:9,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;9&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9739107489585876\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;72581\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:HOGL2E74OI5MLJ65YR7UIURIWF3DXNMW\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:67f4dc89-03e2-4cf9-bdb9-4c4aae387c96>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:46:12\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;54.225.203.66\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:B37KZA2O2RBSSNVS43LIP7Z3YTU6L7BA\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:317e6f4f-a6f0-457c-876a-7d2432562fbc>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79443-dont-overlook-smaller-college-football-programs\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:754,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;754&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Dont Overlook Smaller College Football Programs!\n\nUse your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories\nDont Overlook Smaller College Football Programs!\n\nYear after year, in every aspect of the game, smaller football programs are often overlooked.\n\nMemories of a great Boise State team walking all over a highly ranked Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, Larry Fitzgerald (PITT) losing the 2003 Heisman race to Jason White (OKLA) supposedly based on team record not player performance as the Heisman should be.\n\nNot to take away from White who was a great player, but he finished ranked 8th in passing yards, 26th in completion percentage, and 8th in QB rating.\n\nFitzgerald, on the other hand, finished first in almost every receiving category, but since his school was a lower profile (and ranked lower) many voters chose White instead, Basing there votes on team performance instead of individual stats.\n\nIf the Heisman was based on team performance then every year, the National Champions should pick one of there players to win it since they are the best team it would only be fair. Now how dumb does that sound?\n\nAgain this year, a small school player is setting the precedent nine games into the year, but still Jarrett Dillard of Rice is still never mentioned in the run for Heisman, although he is far ahead of leading receiver candidate Michael Crabtree of Texas Tech. Oh and by the way he has less receptions but still WAY better numbers than Crabtree.\n\nEver since the BCS was implemented, Strength of Schedule has become one of the biggest things in determining a team's grit and power.\n\nI think this has contributed to the brainwashing of those voting on awards and polls. A small team like Ball State does not have the recruiting power of teams like Alabama, Penn State, USC, Ohio State, and Florida.\n\nI think if you are going to incorporate Strength of Schedule into the Heisman equation then you should also calculate Strength of Recruitment!\n\nIf this were the case, we would find out that the small schools and players we are overlooking, if put on a level playing would probably walk all over 50 percent of the teams in the top 25!\n\nPeople do not realize that Nick Saban, one of the best college coaches of the last 2 decades, came from a very small Toledo school, but as soon as he was given the chance to move up, he was an instant success at Michigan State, LSU, and now Alabama.\n\nMy point to this is, the coaches and kids who put up big numbers at small schools would still put up the big numbers if they were given a chance to play at a bigger school.\n\nMost of your LaDainian Tomlinsons (TCU '97-'00) go to smaller colleges and Junior Colleges because of grade requirements or to stay closer to home. A kid that wants or in most cases NEEDS to stay close to home should not be punished for this decision.\n\nI understand that you must incorporate Strength of schedule into the polls in order to determine which team is the strongest in the nation. My only concern is that this is going to continue to spew over into individual awards like the Heisman.\n\nIf this continues to be the case college sports, is going to be so predictable that all your team's best player would have to do to win the Heisman is lead his team to the national championship or at least the top 3 in the final standings.\n\nWhat if Graham Harrell had lost to Texas and then later in the year loses to Oklahoma knocking Tech to No. 14 or 15 in the BCS polls? Does this mean he would be any less worthy than Colt McCoy if Texas were to win the Championship, but McCoy ends up with way less in every offensive category than Harrell?\n\nWould this be right just because Harrell would have two team losses to McCoy's 0? I don't think it would be, and if it is not right for a high-profile team such as Texas Tech, then it should not be right for a smaller school!\n\nYour comments are appreciate.\n\nThanks and please check out my football stats article it may help us all out!\n\n\nLoad More Stories\n\nFollow Alabama Crimson Tide Football from B/R on Facebook\n\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide Football\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nWe will never share your email address\n\nThanks for signing up.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79443-dont-overlook-smaller-college-football-programs&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.01814943552017212,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.018149&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:10,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:914,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;914&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9625359773635864\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;100161\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:WGD3BP2CX6VLZQ7FDYVLOSGTDSI5OGNP\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:415c295b-84d9-4cf1-8edb-d5c2411b126c>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:50:58\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;23.0.160.43\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:JN7DLXCMUROZNPIFTA6GWKK5JB7L4V76\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:5a71da50-0742-4d33-bee1-20e192d1e51f>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2012/03/family-planning-is-a-public-health-issue-that-shouldn%E2%80%99t-be-politicized/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1572,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,572&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Baker Institute Blog\n\n\nFamily planning is a public health issue that shouldn’t be politicized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy\n\n11 Responses\n\n  1. Ovbiously says:\n\n    The purpose of taxpayer supported “public health” is to prevent the spread of diseases that can be communicated without contact with the infected individual. The author and apparently the entire ‘public health’ special interest group is trying to convert ‘public health’ into whatever activity it thinks is a ‘good idea’ and it can bring within the scope of its bureaucracy. It is notable the ‘public health’ bureaucrats are identifying such non diseases as motor vehicle safety. This is another example of jurisdiction creep.\n\n  2. DDD says:\n\n    Very eloquently stated. Should meet the approval of your liberal following.\n\n  3. bigmoney says:\n\n    I agree 100%. Family planning is good public policy that has the added bonus of saving taxpayers’ money and giving people a choice and resources to plan their families. It’s a shame that it has become a political issue.\n\n  4. Mark says:\n\n    too bad you are located in Texas, where women’s health doesn’t count at public health.\n\n  5. Nancy Ford says:\n\n    I had forgotten that Title X which provided women with access to low cost contraceptives was signed into law by Richard Nixon. Clearly, family planning is something that makes sense to the majority of Americans and as such bridges political party divides–unless of course it is being used by the fringe elements as a weapon. I also appreciated the author’s “reality check”–contraception, family planning, is something we had debated and accepted decades ago. The fact that current research deals with emerging nations and not our own advanced society is a wake up call. Why is anyone doubting the benefits of family planning in 2012?\n\n  6. Emily says:\n\n    Eloquent and on the mark. Bravo, Elena Marks.\n\n  7. Kimberly says:\n\n    I couldn’t agree more. We spend so much time on international development and not enough time on the issues in our own backyard. Family planning is an important public policy. Contraceptives should be available and provided at a low cost to anyone who so chooses to use them. Every woman should have the right to choose how and when to plan for a family.\n\n  8. Patricia Snyder says:\n\n    Why is it these days that when people disagree, they label one another, closing the door to honest debate to help find the common ground? I personally believe that America dealt with this issue decades ago, but still have a lot to do to continue to keep our common public, healthy. And for me that means making contraceptives and education about contraceptives available for as many people as possible…\n\n  9. Karen1961 says:\n\n    The health benefits of family planning and widely available contraceptives are unquestioned in the scientific and health policy literature, as are the health benefits of many other public health tools cited by the author. We need to use the best tools available to us to achieve healthy babies, women and families.\n\n  10. Brian says:\n\n    I agree that it is good for a married couple to plan their family. However, if someone doesn’t want to pay for abortion or contraception for moral reasons, they shouldn’t be forced to.\n\n    Contraceptives have lead to higher divorce rate, higher rate of STD’s, and unplanned pregnancies are still an alarming high number.\n\n    Why don’t the statistics support your statements to show that we are reaping the benefits of contraceptives? Oh right, because they aren’t true.\n\n    It’s a much more complicated problem that just giving everyone a pill.\n\n  11. georgex says:\n\n    The directive from the Bible to populate the “four corners” of the earth has been fulfilled. Advocating that birth control should not be used puts the sustainability of the planet in jeopardy, families with more children than they can afford and spread of diseases that cause much misery and death.

Do you think America is ready for a sitcom involving Islamic characters and culture?  Why or why not?\n\nOkay – discuss.\n\nCategories: General\nChuck Miller\n\nOne Response\n\n  1.

That makes sense.\n\nI say no.\n\nCase in point: My oldest and I went around in circles yesterday about studying for a math test. She argued she couldn’t begin studying until her class finished the unit because she “wouldn’t know what to study.” I suggested she start with finished and corrected homework, which seemed like a logical approach. She spent the next 10 minutes telling me why that couldn’t happen, which seemed nonsensical.\n\nHere’s the conversation:\n\nMe: Do you have a math test coming up?\n\nHer: When we finish the unit.\n\nMe: When is that?\n\nHer: If we finish the unit Friday, the test will be Monday. If we finish Monday, it will be Tuesday.\n\nMe: Maybe you can study a little each night between now and then.\n\nHer: No, I can’t until we finish the unit.\n\nMe: What?\n\nHer: I won’t know what to study.\n\nMe: You’re doing homework every night. Presumably, that is the material that will be on the test.\n\nHer: I don’t want to study it if I’m doing it wrong.\n\nMe: Doesn’t your teacher grade it?\n\nHer: No, he just marks whether you’ve done it.\n\nMe: Really? He doesn’t go over the homework? I need to know because I think maybe I need to talk to him then.\n\nHer: He only goes over the ones you did wrong.\n\nMe: Is there something you can go over, practice each night?\n\nHer: No, I have to wait until the unit is done and do the review homework.\n\nMe: (imagine, if you will, my raised voice) OK, Use whatever study method you want. If you bring home a C, the cellphone is gone.\n\nTracy Ormsbee\n\n8 Responses\n\n  1. Kathleen says:\n\n    Good answer! I say you won the argument.\n\n  2. kvp says:\n\n    If you figure out how to stop the procrastination please, please please tell me how… I’ll pay you… a lot…\n\n  3. ChristineV says:\n\n    Ha! This reminds me of a conversation I had with our son while driving home from soccer last week. He and his Dad had come to blows over computer use and bedtime the night before.\n    Me: when I say 10:30 bedtime it doesn’t mean coming upstairs and getting ready at 10:30\n    He: that’s lame\n    Me: you need to be off the computer 1 hour before bedtime\n    He: owww, why? That’s lame (stupid, dumb – insert word here)\n    It wasn’t quite that bad, but you get the picture. We had a calm, quiet discussion and in the end I said “we have to agree to disagree. I can see my side and yours, as can you, but on this we are not going to agree”. But I won since the parents’ rules win. :)\n\n  4. lizzee says:\n\n    Oh,so have been there! Wish it was over when they hit a certain age but find those talks are still common with my married daughter and myself. Moms must talk in tongues to our children’s ears. And the best retort they give is’You just don’t know!”\n\n  5. KTT says:\n\n    When I was in high school, and even college, I had such a hard time studying for math tests! I could study for anything else and do well, but I had no clue how to approach studying numbers, it just didn’t make sense to me. I used to do well in math until I got to high school and I actually had to study. Since I didn’t know what or how to study, I fell behind. I would talk to her teacher anyway and ask if she/he can give you tips on studying at night. Maybe they have notes they take or some extra problems to solve.\n\n  6. Naomi Seldin says:\n\n    I’m having flashbacks to when I was in high school, Tracy. My father was a lawyer — he argued for a living. Can you imagine trying to win a case against that?\n\n  7. Tracy Ormsbee says:\n\n    @Naomi: I should change my headline to ask, Can you win an argument with a teenager without a law degree. :)\n\n  8. maggie says:\n\n    @Naomi – more importantly, does he give lessons?\n\n  9. john says:\n\n    You cant win an argument with a woman. Why do you think you could with a teenager?

Because they can't talk at all. At least not to humans.\n\nResearchers at Harvard Medical School took a break from studying lobster fighting and shifted their focus to fruit fly fights, and even mutant fruit fly fights.\n\n(Via The Annals of Improbable Research.)\n\nFruit flies are strange creatures. Or perhaps it's that fruit fly researchers are strange creatures.\n\nOne of my cousins was a fruit fly researcher. She took fruit fly testicles and squashed them and then studied them under a microscope, looking for... something... I forget. I think just finding the fruit fly testicles in the first place was accomplishment enough.\n\nFruit fly researchers like to give their discoveries strange names. Typically, a gene is named after what results when you disable it. For example, a gene without which fruit flies die in two days is named Kenny, after the South Park character.\n\nMy favorite: The gene without which fruit flies get drunk really easily is called cheap date. (That last page has several more funny gene names.)\n\nYes, that's right. Fruit flies get drunk. There's a fruit fly drunk-o-meter, though I forget how it works. But one amusing aspect of fruit fly drunkenness is that just before they finally pass out, there's a big burst of activity.\n\nStrange gene naming has spread beyond the fruit fly world. There is a human gene named sonic hedgehog after the Sega video game character. (It's related to the fruit fly gene \&quot;hedgehog\&quot;, so named because disabling it causes the fly to develop into a ball with spikes.)&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/28/167801.aspx?Redirected=true&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.543147623538971,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.543148&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:91,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;91&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9245023131370544\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;80197\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:CJPJBADRDTTA5EIPAOH3O2CP4MOCR235\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:3731c6bb-72ea-474c-b042-cef10f0d7dd7>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:10:43\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;65.52.103.95\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:Y7IFDAW7KGVI2UJRL45IXASTHZOBCUIM\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:46b9e1e0-68ed-44e6-9dcd-cc365856d342>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualworld/archive/2007/03/23/can-i-sequence-my-old-nt4-app-s.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:420,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;420&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Well the answer is easy ..... No!? Or is it..... This is really a two fold statement.\n\nWe do not have a sequencer for NT 4.0. So basically you cannot sequence your application from NT 4.0 directly and put them straight into your Windows XP SoftGrid environment!\n\n\nSo if that's the case, how do I get my application from NT 4.0 to Sequenced Virtual Application and then deployed? Well, I hate to say it but there is no easy route! The main thing to understand is getting a process behind you to bring your application up to a specific level and then sequenced on a supportable platform such as Windows XP.\n\nApplication Compatability \n\nApplication Migration Process from NT 4.0 (High Level)\n\nThe above show this process around taking an old NT 4.0 application and passing it through the application compatibility toolkit. Now I am not saying this is the be all and end all but it certainly can be used as a good guide, or flow process you can leverage off!\n\nThe Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) enables software developers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and IT professionals who work in a corporate environment to determine, before rolling out within the organization, whether their applications are compatible with a new version of the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. ACT also enables such individuals to determine how an update to the new version will impact their applications.\nYou can use the ACT features to:\n\n\nYou can download it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=24DA89E9-B581-47B0-B45E-492DD6DA2971&amp;displaylang=en \n\nOnce your application is to a stable state you can look to run through the sequencing wizards as per normal and capture your application.\n\n\nThe core benefit is that you are just trying to get this one suite of applications working! Not regression testing it against many others 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, etc etc application along side it.\n\nThis can help save you and your business valuable time and stop massive amounts of pain with your upgrades from NT 4.0 to XP/Vista! We know that there are many companies still going through these migrations, and in my humble opinion I hope that this helps you migrate more dynamically from these older legacy platforms.

Date:  8/4/2004  2:16 AM\nAuthor:  JAFO31 Number:  72734 of 120439\n\nFoolferlove: \&quot;I'd like to take a loan out at the first bank of Lorenzo too. 4 percent sounds real good to me! Where should I send the application?\n\n\nActually, I do have a real question...Can I loan money to a family member and charge zero interest with an indefinite repayment period? Or is this kind of loan somehow a no-no since it can be used to get around gift taxes?\&quot;\n\nIIRC, it can create phantom income for the lender (and potential gift tax issues if the loan is relatively large). My recollection is a bit hazy, but a believe that there is a de minimis exception for loan below a certain size (mayber 10k?); but in any event, if the loan is has a below market rate --- by reference to some applicable \&quot;federal funds\&quot; rate --- then the IRS will impute additional interest until the rate is at the \&quot;federal funds\&quot; rate the the lender needs to recognize phantom income (as if the interest were paid and then gifted).\n\nFor example (all numbers hypothetical) if Daddy Warbucks loans Warbucks Junior $800k at zero interest when the applicable rate should be 4%, then Daddy Warbucks is deemed to have 32k in phantom interest income (800k * [4% - 0% charged]) on which income tax is due and is also deemed to have made a gift of the 32k interest not collected, which is larger than the 11k annual exemption (or 22k if Daddy Warbucks is married), so a gift tax return would also be due, unless Warbucks, Jr. is married, too - because 32k less than 44k available from a married couple to another married couple.\n\nOne fo the resident pros will need to add the exact details and citation.\n\nRegards, JAFO\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://boards.fool.com/MessagePrint.aspx?mid=21110987&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0289689302444458,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.028969&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.969287633895874\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;30724\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http;

Manager Bobby Valentine went to his bullpen with an eight-run lead against the Yankees on national television, only to witness an implosion of epic proportions.\n\nIn other words, it's amazing how much things have changed for a team that is suddenly among the hottest in baseball.\n\nThis time, Valentine went to his relief crew for the final six outs with the narrowest of margins.\n\nAnd they came through, leading the streaking Red Sox to a 1-0 win over the White Sox on Saturday night.\n\nBoston has won six in a row -- all six victories coming in the aftermath of that blown 9-1 lead against the Yankees last Saturday.\n\n\&quot;That's what they're going to do all year,\&quot; said Adrian Gonzalez, who had the only RBI in the game. \&quot;We know that. For the first couple of weeks, as the guys [struggled], especially on a team like this where everything gets overblown, overdrawn, you start pressing a little bit, trying harder. As the season goes and you get into the flow of things, you just stop thinking about that and do what you can. That's what these guys are doing.\&quot;\n\nFor the first time this season, Valentine's team is at .500. This, after a 4-10 start.\n\nThe strong relief performances of Franklin Morales, Vicente Padilla and Alfredo Aceves gave ace Jon Lester his first win.\n\n\&quot;They're coming together,\&quot; Valentine said. \&quot;You play the season to build the little parts of your team. I think the bullpen is coming together pretty nicely. Even though it's been Padilla-Morales, tonight it was Morales-Padilla and they got through that [eighth] inning nicely. Alfredo finished it off. But the 1-0 game is the toughest game to go to the bullpen, we all know that, especially on the road. You don't win a lot of games 1-0 on the road.\&quot;\n\nIt was Boston's first 1-0 win since a 16-inning thriller at Tampa Bay on July 17 of last season.\n\nFor Lester, it was his first victory since Sept. 6, 2011.\n\n\&quot;Well, sometime, either last night or today, he asked what he had to do,\&quot; Valentine said. \&quot;I just said, 'Pitch like an ace, like Jon Lester is', and he pitched like an ace. He had both sides of the plate. Two-seamer away, cutter in. Had a good changeup. Very competitive. He was terrific.\&quot;\n\nAnd he needed to be. Lester's opponent was Jake Peavy, who pitched a complete game, only to get the tough-luck loss.\n\n\&quot;Those games are fun. It's just a battle,\&quot; Lester said. \&quot;I've been on the other end of those. You feel like you do everything you can to put your team in position to win, and the other guy just does a little bit more or you don't get the timely hitting or whatever. That was big tonight, grinding it out. Our hitters did a great job. Defense played awesome tonight. Those are more or less fun. Every win is important for a pitcher.\&quot;\n\nThe Red Sox have gone a full turn through the rotation with every pitcher earning a win.\n\n\&quot;When Josh [Beckett] won his game, we said maybe we'll put a string together,\&quot; Valentine said. \&quot;Now we have them all winning. That's how you start building a real foundation of a team. Those other little things are just parts of a team but foundation is what those starters can do day in and day out. They're pretty good. I'll take those five that we're running out there right now.\&quot;\n\nLester went seven innings, allowing five hits and no runs while walking one and striking out seven. He threw 122 pitches, 78 for strikes.\n\nThen there was Peavy, who gave up four hits and one run, walking one and striking out seven.\n\n\&quot;The ball bounced their way tonight,\&quot; Peavy said. \&quot;We did all we could do. Lester was mighty good.\&quot;\n\nWhen Peavy buckled ever so slightly in the fourth, the Red Sox made him pay.\n\nRyan Sweeney started it, blooping one into right and hustling out of the box for a double.\n\n\&quot;I knew if he didn't catch it that I would have a chance,\&quot; Sweeney said. \&quot;I was just going to try to make something happen.\&quot;\n\nWith one out, Gonzalez fought off a 2-2 fastball against Peavy, his former teammate in San Diego, and punched it into right for the RBI single.\n\n\&quot;Fastballs in,\&quot; Gonzalez said. \&quot;We go to 2-2 with fastballs in and I had a feeling he was going to stay with a fastball in and I just told myself, 'Get on top.' If he makes a good pitch down, offspeed down, then you have to tip your hat. I wasn't going to let him go up top again.\&quot;\n\nLester held it right there, and handed it off to the bullpen.\n\nAfter Morales and Padilla navigated their way through the eighth, on came Aceves. He was magnificent, mowing through the White Sox 1-2-3 and ending the game by striking out A.J. Pierzynski on a changeup.\n\n\&quot;He was great,\&quot; Valentine said. \&quot;You know, we talked to him that he doesn't always have to throw it 97 [mph]. Tonight, he threw some very effective fastballs at 94, 93, and then had his 96, 97. He pitched. He got the final strikeout with a changeup. That's what you have to do.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_04_28_bosmlb_chamlb_1&amp;mode=recap_away&amp;c_id=bos&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.025928139686584473,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.025928&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:29,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;29&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9791687726974488\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;68544\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:AYYYRK426WY3GYBCWQ47Z3JZK67DVIC7\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:17e6e4cb-ad30-49f7-a4b6-e86115af023c>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:44:57\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.140\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:OVVTIJPCJ7OBQVOBHIBDNNQ425ZH4Q6A\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:a0ae55b6-92e3-4fd7-918c-9d3f93b5e6d9>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/14139/the-pope-is-resigning-how-does-a-living-pope-confer-his-authority?answertab=oldest\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:549,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;549&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nI read that Pope Benedict XVI is resigning.

Since he resigned, is his authority to lead the Catholic church removed from him, or how does that work?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nup vote 8 down vote accepted\n\nYes, as the Pope said in his resignation speech, he gives up the office and it is for those whose duty it is to convoke the conclave and elect a successor — just as it would be if he had died.\n\nAs a cardinal, he's entitled to attend the conclave (but he probably won't) but he can't vote because he's over eighty.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAdditionally, his papal ring will be destroyed, just as if he had died. I forget the source, but the analogy of death while still breathing is wholly correct. –  Affable Geek Feb 13 '13 at 13:38\nYes, after he abdicates he has no say whatsoever in where authority passes thereafter. –  mxyzplk Feb 13 '13 at 22:24\nadd comment\n\nJimmy Akin stated on his blog:\n\nPope Benedict may follow the pattern of previously resigned popes and spend the rest of his days in a monastery. Alternately, he may live quietly with his brother. Either way, he will do his best to stay out of the public eye so as to give his successor the freest hand possible. (This is the same thing that usually happens when a U.S. president leaves office; it’s traditional for him to more-or-less vanish, at least for a time.)\n\nThe papal authority is removed completely from the ex-pope. From wikipedia, I understood that his ring, seal etc. are destroyed as though he died, though it's not clearly stated there.\n\nAs Andrew Leach wrote, as a cardinal the ex-pope can attend conclave, but even if he was younger than eighty, he would be expected not to be very active in the election of his successor (part of the tradition of vanishing from public).\n\nEDIT: according to what I found while researching answer for a related question, there is an aspect of the pope's role he maintains after resignation, or even after death: the obligation and authority to pray for the Church.\n\nAnother EDIT: as Cardinal Lombardi said, Joseph Ratzinger won't participate in the conclave. In Czech version the Vatican Radio goes to more details, such as that Ratzinger will no longer be a Cardinal, but I didn't find it in English.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIt's on Vatican Insider Because this is entirely new -- the circumstances are rather different from Gregory XII -- I rather think that no-one, including the Curia, knows precisely what the procedures and protocols are. –  Andrew Leach Feb 15 '13 at 8:13\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/14139/the-pope-is-resigning-how-does-a-living-pope-confer-his-authority?answertab=oldest&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.8555231094360352,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.855523&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9526035785675048\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;162742\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:6OCPFGETMK7SF2U4L6X3ND6KV5NMJ3KZ\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:0f12ee14-6748-46eb-9f0b-f105d3d4ef07>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:46:32\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;208.111.160.6\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:QALOBXFGTW6K5P4Q7H3XWDN5B7JRLIRN\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:82cca719-61ad-43eb-a774-3e4f475c1a18>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://comments.startribune.com/comments.php?d=content_comments&amp;asset_id=179852531&amp;section=/world\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:863,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;863&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Palestinian civilian death toll mounts as Israel targets militants in residential areas\n\n  • Article by: IBRAHIM BARZAK and KARIN LAUB , Associated Press\n  • Updated: November 19, 2012 - 6:24 AM\n  • 51\n  • Comments\n\n  • Results per page:\nmarketing guyNov. 18, 12 9:45 AM\n\nHow about making it clear that the Gaza Palestinian's hide the rocket launchers in schools, daycare centers, residential areas and places of worship? Israel is not indescriminate about these strikes.\n\nbudgrant00Nov. 18, 1210:13 AM\n\nThis is the sort of thing that happens when launching missiles from neighborhoods. Hamas makes the most of playing the sympathy card while using human shields. Also CNN and the BBC were showing falsified video of 'victims' yesterday, one guy was seen being carried aloft by rescuers only to to be seen later leading a demonstration none the worse for wear. Another poor 'victim' stopped the act a bit too soon and jumped off the stretcher before the director had called \&quot;cut\&quot; it would seem. Yes there are innocent victims in wars, but they are very useful victims for Hamas sadly.\n\nmoney2145Nov. 18, 1210:52 AM\n\nI think it's something that the US can have drones blast rebels and civilians and no one says much about it. But when Israeli rockets do the same thing, everyone gets up in arms. Hell, Israel has rockets being fired at it's people. What Nation on this earth would NOT fire back? Israel should tell the Government in Gasa that the first rocket that falls into any city and kills any people, the WAR will begin and Gasa will be totally taken over AND KEPT as Israeli land forever. NEVER to be given back. And if Egypt wants to join Hammus in the fighting, IT's territory will be kept too; NEVER to be given back. If they did that, Israel would be a LOT BIGGER NATION within a few years. And after those few years, Israel would be a lot safer because it's neighbors will realize they are going to lose ground and Israel will get bigger. There is NOT ONE OTHER COUNTRY that would allow rockets to be fired on itself without declaring war.\n\nd434478Nov. 18, 1210:53 AM\n\nWell...if hidden in homes, pick another target...there have to be plenty.

How does that work exactly when the targeted missiles are where the targeted missiles are placed amongst homes and schools? That said, last time Israel did refrain from taking out Hamas leadership when they were using human shields and arriving unannounced to sleep in random civilian homes.\n\nowatonnabillNov. 18, 1211:55 AM\n\nThe fact that these brave jehadists need to hide behind womens' skirts and childrens' schools and day care centers says a lot.\n\nbudgrant00Nov. 18, 1212:05 PM\n\nAs for missiles in question they were smuggled in from Iran. Two ways into Gaza, through Egypt via the official entry points or the tunnels Israel took out a couple years ago. The other way is on relief and supply ships which Israel gets grief over searching. So we have Hamas and Iran going to great lengths to arm Gaza and launch randomly on Israel, and people can't understand why Gaza gets hit? So what would any other nation do in Israel's place when faced with a terrorist group backed openly by a soon to be nuked up Iran? I'm not sure what the anti Israel folks here expect? The settlement program is about creating defensible borders. If Israel could be assured they would never again need to defend it's self that land would be turned over, but the reality is that it will never be the case.\n\nhobie2Nov. 18, 1212:08 PM\n\nIf you don't assassinate elected leaders and crow about it, you don't get rockets shot at you. You don't get rockets shot at you, you don't have to bomb apartment buildings... We knew this for decades, and we know that blaming the Palestinian family for their children dying for their allowing armed militants on their roofs is only done by fools and cowards, done by sociopaths so sick fools can swallow it and nod as to how it is justified.. but then, you are what you do. Little cowards will always be little cowards.\n\nstingballNov. 18, 12 1:33 PM\n\nAnd here we go again with the media falling into the hands of the Hamas terrorists, blaming Israel for killing civilians instead of accurately pointing out how Hamas provoked Israel into a confrontation. And not mentioning how the Hamas terrorists typically hide amongst civilians populations to keep from being target. The correct blame belongs on the Hamas terrorists who cowardly commit terrorist acts and hide within civilian populations, directly putting innocent civilians at risk. Interesting how often the media cannot scratch just a little bit beneath the surface and see the real truth.\n\n\nComment on this story   |  \n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://comments.startribune.com/comments.php?d=content_comments&amp;asset_id=179852531&amp;section=/world&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.07970279455184937,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.079703&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:16,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;16&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9164720177650452\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;14478\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:BMSHYKNOBBIAWEGGMYYSVZQ4CQRY5AKS\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:40ebe157-751b-4767-a0aa-2693ecb7c782>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:47:34\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;134.4.25.184\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:NMRRFVZKNN3LDKIJPTV3TRBKOL3HMTC3\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:93e8c5f1-0878-42a4-a45e-e78e62629f2b>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:735,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;735&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;IR Atmospheric Windows\n\nThe Universe sends us light at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, most of this light does not reach us at ground level here on Earth. Why? Because we have an atmosphere which blocks out many types of radiation while letting other types through. Fortunately for life on Earth, our atmosphere blocks out harmful, high energy radiation like X-rays, gamma rays and most of the ultraviolet rays. It also block out most infrared radiation, as well as very low energy radio waves. On the other hand, our atmosphere lets visible light, most radio waves, and small wavelength ranges of infrared light through, allowing astronomers to view the Universe at these wavelengths.\n\nMost of the infrared light coming to us from the Universe is absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. Only in a few narrow wavelength ranges, can infrared light make it through (at least partially) to a ground based infrared telescope.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere causes another problem for infrared astronomers. The atmosphere itself radiates strongly in the infrared, often putting out more infrared light than the object in space being observed. This atmospheric infrared emission peaks at a wavelength of about 10 microns (micron is short for a micrometer or one millionth of a meter).\n\nSo the best view of the infrared universe, from ground based telescopes, are at infrared wavelengths which can pass through the Earth's atmosphere and at which the atmosphere is dim in the infrared. Ground based infrared observatories are usually placed near the summit of high, dry mountains to get above as much of the atmosphere as possible. Even so, most infrared wavelengths are completely absorbed by the atmosphere and never make it to the ground.\n\nFrom the table below, you can see that only a few of the infrared \&quot;windows\&quot; have both high sky transparency and low sky emission. These infrared windows are mainly at infrared wavelengths below 4 microns.\n\nInfrared Windows in the Atmosphere\n\nSky Transparency\nSky Brightness\n1.1 - 1.4 microns\nlow at night\n1.5 - 1.8 microns\nvery low\n2.0 - 2.4 microns\nvery low\n3.0 - 4.0 microns\n3.0 - 3.5 microns: fair\n3.5 - 4.0 microns: high\n4.6 - 5.0 microns\n7.5 - 14.5 microns\n8 - 9 microns and 10 -12 microns: fair\nothers: low\nvery high\n17 - 40 microns\n17 - 25 microns: Q\n28 - 40 microns: Z\nvery low\nvery high\n330 - 370 microns\nvery low\n\nBasically, everything we have learned about the Universe comes from studying the light or electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects in space. To get a complete picture of the Universe, we need to see it in all of its light, at all wavelengths. This is why it is so important to send observatories into space, to get above our atmosphere which prevents so much of this valuable information from reaching us.\n\nSince most infrared light is blocked by our atmosphere, infrared astronomers have placed instruments onboard, rockets, balloons, aircraft and space telescopes to view regions of the infrared which are not detectable from the ground. As a result, amazing discoveries about our Universe have been made and hundreds of thousands of new astronomical sources have been detected for the first time.\n\nDue to the rapid development of better infrared detectors and the ability to place telescopes in space, the future is extremely bright for infrared astronomy.\n\nGround based infrared observatories, using advanced techniques such as Adaptive Optics are providing fascinating views of the infrared Universe viewed through our atmosphere's infrared windows.\n\nMauna Kea Observatories\nAlthough these observatories cannot view at other infrared wavelengths, they can observe the near-infrared sky almost anytime the weather permits, providing valuable long term studies of objects in space.\n\nNew missions are being planned to get above the atmosphere to observe the infrared Universe with better resolution than ever before. SOFIA, an airborne observatory, is schedule to start operations in 2004. The Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in August 2003, is NASA's next great observatory in space.\n\nIn the next decade, you will probably hear much news about discoveries being made in infrared astronomy, as we now can see beyond our atmosphere's infrared windows!\n\nInfrared Astronomy HOME PAGE | Discovery of Infrared | What is Infrared? | Infrared Astronomy Overview | Atmospheric Windows | Near, Mid &amp; Far Infrared | The Infrared Universe | Spectroscopy | Timeline | Background | Future Missions | News &amp; Discoveries | Images &amp; Videos | Activities | Infrared Links | Educational Links | Getting into Astronomy&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.05251514911651611,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.052515&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:17,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;17&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9667264819145204\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;77354\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:HLEXB44P556MQUEJYIKQXXGXIU24I4KD\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:ca5f34e5-8f85-4ee1-9a84-32a61a086734>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:49:59\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;184.173.93.234\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:KEIMEPBKYVQQ3FKUSS5CTXJBPRVBNA4J\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:1e3a5553-4b02-484d-b78c-06f8889b65bd>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://cowboyszone.com/threads/what-are-the-chances-you-think-the-boys-will-bring-in-norv-as-oc.246555/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:842,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;842&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\n\nWhat are the chances you think the Boys will bring in Norv as OC?\n\nDiscussion in 'Fan Zone' started by scrives, Nov 2, 2012.\n\n  1. scrives\n\n    scrives Member\n\n    197 Messages\n    0 Likes Received\n    You think the Boys would bring in Norv Turner as OC if he gets caned in SD?\n    He would have this offense rolling and Tony playing a heck of alot better!!

First, he won't be leaving San Diego before the end of this season. And their team usually picks up about this part of the season anyways. So he should be good for one more season there.\n\n    A head coach usually has his call as to who are his Coordinators. Jason Garrett chose this format and Jerry wouldn't pull the plug on Jason before a full three years as the head coach to begin with.\n  7. Idgit\n\n    Idgit Ice up, son. Ice up!

You could make him passing coordinator and a big salary. Getting him here would be a plus but I'd rather have someone who could mix in the West Coast variant more or even some more Martz. Turner and Red are a good bit alike but there aren't many people who know enough to really answer that question with any authority.\n\n    Jason needs to mix things up more using our RBs like Martz, our WRs more like Walsh, and use Hanna and Witten more like Jason Garrett. Use Witten underneath and intermediate some and use Hanna more like Gates. He needs to vary the tempo of the game more and even occasionally use the hurry up and no huddle offense.\n\nShare This Page&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://cowboyszone.com/threads/what-are-the-chances-you-think-the-boys-will-bring-in-norv-as-oc.246555/&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.01997530460357666,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.019975&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:32,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;32&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.6678873896598816\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;2031\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:SJ3CCIVXZSGURQTJ3VY6KCPZFGYU7NLO\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:317637e2-0b71-45d0-b963-c6f78487c0b6>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T16:30:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;199.15.176.161\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:RUCDSKVZ7ZAQIU3FUA2AFNZ5VRN3HRCA\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:08de410e-ab42-4ddd-8843-b0e7fa437044>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JHI/perl-5.8.0/hints/unicos.sh\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:190,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;190&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;case `uname -r` in 6.1*) shellflags=\&quot;-m+65536\&quot; ;; esac case \&quot;$optimize\&quot; in # If we used fastmd (the default) integer values would be limited to 46 bits. # --Mark P.

May I ask why you feel they are not? Not flaming, just curious as I happen to love the site and was wondering if you had found better deals elsewhere. If so, share! :)\n\n\nDoes Woot post travel offers as a scapegoat for downvotes to protect the other offers?\n\n\n3 nights is not a vacation. just saying.\n\n\n@kerowyn: Travelzoo tends to be an ad-plagued dungeon of forcing-you-to-search-on-other-sites-through-them-so-they-get-commissions... uhhhh... -itude.\n\nNine times out of ten, the travel deals posted here have been thinly veiled timeshare scams, very restrictive on location (Fly to Honolulu for $49!* *Only if departing from Oahu. From LA, $1,099. DC, $35,983), or ad-plagued dungeons of see-above.\n\nThis one seems to be another of the third category with some of the first mixed in. The price listed is if leaving from Ft Lauderdale. For me in DC, it was about double the listed... if I even had the right package, it was hard to be sure.\n\n\n@jai151 You are right on the money there!\n\nI clicked on it, and couldn't even tell where the real deal was. Also I saw several times \&quot;Airfare estimated\&quot; So this doesn't really mean much for the money its advertising...\n\n\n@solo154: I was so lost trying to navigate the site I got my order mixed up in my comment. I meant to say third with some of the second, didn't see any timeshare stuff there but plenty of misleading rates, including one listed with New York in the search box under but the rate was from Florida.\n\n\n@jai151: I got a Bahamas all inclusive deal from them and it was fine as well as several local deals. Yeah, I had to fly to Ft. Lauderdale to make it worth it, but it was still a good deal. 400 bucks for a 3 day thing, and an extra 200 for my additional airfare from LA. No timeshare talks were even mentioned.\n\nThe whole point of their site is so you don't have to search for vacation deals yourself. I don't think they are particularly deceptive about restrictions or anything. It seems a little harsh to call it a dungeon.\n\n\nI swear to goodness...if there is ever a vacation deal that y'all don't vote down into oblivion, I'm going to have to jump on it because it'll be a deal for real!!!&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://deals.woot.com/deals/details/c4a0d0a6-0c8a-4772-a3de-0bc60c355913/jamaica-vacation-flight-3-nights-atall-inclusive-beachfront-riu-montego-bay&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.14813387393951416,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.148134&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.963388741016388\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;77088\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:4X73JVDLU3QIXRSANOECWGSNEGSQGRA3\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:fd13b731-3173-4edb-9e33-78eaa15d051b>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:20:33\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;66.111.101.249\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:ZJ2IH73K7F3GJICTSMMFREUBWM72J7P3\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:74db4ae4-040c-43ca-9b41-ed3964e000ba>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://deltafarmpress.com/how-much-life-insurance-enough\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:962,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;962&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;As a farmer, more money passes through your hands each year than goes through a local county official’s re-election campaign. So, if something tragic were to happen to you, who would pay those bills to the bank, the equipment manufacturer, and the chemical seed dealer? And, what would it take to settle those accounts in full?\n\nThe answer, according to one independent insurance agent, is as much a personal choice as it is a matter of finance.\n\nWhile some industry experts advocate carrying life insurance policies equal to 10 or 15 times your annual income, Mike Anderson of Anderson Insurance in Indianola, Miss., said, \&quot;There is no particular formula to determine exactly how much life insurance you need.\&quot;\n\nIn today’s environment, he said, owning a million dollars or more of life insurance is very common. But, to be truthful, it’s never really enough when something happens. You should base your level of coverage on your personal financial goals, which may include your children’s education or the desire to provide lifetime income security for your family.\n\n\&quot;As a farmer, you should definitely choose a level of coverage that will, at the very minimum, cover your crop and equipment loans, so that if something happens to you mid-season, your family is protected and a fire sale is avoided,\&quot; he said.\n\nThe first step in determining how much insurance is right for you, Anderson said, is to answer a few simple questions.\n\no Is someone, including your local lending official, requiring that you secure a set amount of life insurance in order to obtain a business loan?\n\no How much money does it realistically take you to farm each year?\n\no Are you married? How many children do you have?\n\no What are your concerns for your family if something were to happen to you? Do you want to guarantee your children’s education? Do you want to guarantee a lifetime income for your spouse?\n\no What is your greatest monetary concern if something happens to you?\n\nOnce you’ve taken the time to answer these questions and now know how much life insurance you want to purchase, the next step is determining what type of insurance best fits your individual goals.\n\nSelecting a type of insurance, Anderson said, is based on three things: your budget, your comfort level for risk, and your desire to either rent or own your insurance.\n\n\&quot;Do you want a return on your money or do you just want pure term insurance?\&quot; he asks. \&quot;Pure term will always be the most economical coverage available. However, the more expensive permanent coverage policies, including universal life, whole life and variable life, build equity.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;Each of the insurance products offers its own distinct advantages and disadvantages,\&quot; Anderson said. \&quot;Some people purchase term policies because they feel like that’s all they can afford to spend. Some people have a difficult time saving money, and the whole, universal and variable life policies are a forced savings for them.\&quot;\n\nThe primary advantage to term life insurance, whether you choose an annual renewal policy or a fixed 20-year policy, is price. \&quot;You are getting more bang for the buck because term policies offer the least expensive premiums per $1,000 in coverage,\&quot; he said. \&quot;The disadvantage to term is that if you outlive the 10- or 20-year period of the term policy and still need the same amount of coverage, it will cost you more.\&quot;\n\nWhole life, variable life and universal life policies build cash values that can provide money for future needs. The consumer accepts the risk of cash value growth with the variable life product; the company accepts the risk with whole life and universal life contracts.\n\nWith both whole life and universal life policies, the policy’s \&quot;cash value\&quot; is determined by the company, based on either whatever measure the company is using to index the cash value or a minimum guarantee.\n\nAnd, while the two types of coverage share many of the same characteristics, whole life policies offer a fixed premium, and universal life policies offer some flexibility in premium costs.\n\n\&quot;The premium for whole life is generally more expensive, but this type of policy offers stronger guarantees,\&quot; Anderson said. \&quot;The advantage to universal life coverage is that you can control the amount of premium you pay, as long as you pay the company’s minimum premium. However, that’s also the disadvantage to universal coverage because it’s human nature to pay as little as possible, which can jeopardize your insurance coverage down the road and can cause your premiums to increase.\&quot;\n\nIn comparison, variable life insurance offers a greater opportunity for \&quot;cash value\&quot; growth. Along with this opportunity comes risk.\n\n\&quot;We can all understand risk as we reflect over the past 18 months,\&quot; Anderson said. \&quot;Variable means exactly what it said. Your cash value will vary according to your selections of stock market sub-accounts offered by that particular company.\&quot;\n\nThe only guarantees offered by a variable life insurance policy are the maximum mortality charges and the maximum expenses of the policy.\n\n\&quot;In the past few years, this type of coverage has been attractive to those people seeking greater opportunity for growth. There are many people who only want term and then there are those who believe cash value policies are the best. What is comfortable for me, may not be comfortable for you,\&quot; Anderson said.\n\n\&quot;We’ve all been told it’s better to own a house than to rent because when you own a house you build equity. It is equity that allows us to make a second mortgage when money is needed for education or a new car. If you hadn’t built that equity you might not have been able to come up with those extra dollars,\&quot; he adds. \&quot;Also, if we knew when we were going to die, we would know exactly what coverage to buy. That is why they call it life insurance.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://deltafarmpress.com/how-much-life-insurance-enough&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.03293222188949585,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.032932&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.8667330145835876\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;47550\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:WYN3RBQG7K4YRFUKIHFVCHS2CCTJSEU4\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:848cc9bd-472e-4be6-abbc-81c4a1cd6c12>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:15:07\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;23.218.59.80\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:CW3SEJTYONSGIW76OKDRYYW3CD7C4ZVR\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:25eebae5-76c1-421c-a3fd-38da9dbccc12>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://developer.nokia.com/community/discussion/showthread.php/3460-Problem-with-AIF-builder-in-7650-SDK\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:76,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;76&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm trying to generate an application information file with AIF builder.

As I tried to install the windows today, I realize that the openings are out of square. One opening is not allowing the top of the window to sit into the opening by 1/8 inch, and I don't have enough slack on the other side to bring it up.\n\nThe other opening next to it, is out of square too far to one side. So I will need to put in more than shims to make it attach.\n\nAny practical suggestions?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nRough openings are exactly as they are called, rough. Yours sounds extra rough though. All rough openings are made to have space to add shims, sometimes the rough openings, because of conditions, can only take shims on one side or the other.\n\nAs a rule of thumb I usually do not use no more than 2 shims on a side. If the rough opening (RO) has need for more, I usually add a piece of plywood to bring the opening down where 2 shims will work on a given side. There is no rule that says the plywood has to be the full length of the opening. I also rip my plywood filler 1/4\&quot; narrower than the RO material. Dimensional lumber shrinks, and this smaller dimension keeps the plywood from giving you trouble later on.\n\nEdit 12-31-13 I need to clarify the shim statement. The 2 shims I refer to is, per placement. I use what is called undercoursing shingles used in roofing. They need to be made narrower, whether split, razor knifed, or table sawn. You get a lot for the money. The ones in the little packs aren't even uniform in their taper. There will obviously be a number of placements per side, depending on how large any given item is to be fastened.\n\nOn the opening that is too small at the top, if it is a non bearing wall, you may be able to remove the jack stud and replace it with thinner material. If it is a bearing wall, a picture would be handy to see what the conditions are. It may be as simple as using a chisel to trim the little you need to get the window in. It may only need a good smack with the hammer to shift the framing enough to get the window in. A couple well placed 12D-16D toenails may help too. Give it a whack, literally.\n\nI can't determine anymore to do without seeing the conditions. Bearing, non bearing, jack studs, common studs etc...\n\nAlso check the ends of the wall that the windows are in, the wall may have racked, which in turn will make your ROs out of square.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/37327/what-can-i-do-about-out-of-square-rough-opening-for-new-windows&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.04137837886810303,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.041378&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:29,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:22,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;22&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9291768670082092\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;72595\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:IBD6TK6XXU3GZJ2435WKJ2H5UQMRMRIN\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:6b94cd61-cabf-419b-8843-490cf78a505b>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:43:12\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;198.252.206.140\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:QVKRF2NGCAEL7HLLDXARVA2SDF3G37VA\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5619dae-57e3-420c-a5df-bcbcbe2f0f0a>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/9646/how-do-i-use-precision-screwdrivers\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:458,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;458&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Take the 2-minute tour ×\n\nI am talking about those small and narrow screwdrivers with a thin handle.

I prefer the all metal sets now. –  Hemm Oct 24 '11 at 0:10\nadd comment\n\nUse a pair of pliers to grab the screwdriver, and while applying downward force to the screwdriver (so it doesn't slip and strip your screws), carefully apply pressure using the pliers.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI was thinking on the same idea but if you are working with laptop, avoid this method as it can easily scratch the laptop surface. The above pair does a very nice job. –  Johny Oct 21 '11 at 6:35\nI agree. It's better to have the right tools (bigger handles), but in a pinch pilers will work. You do absolutely have to be careful though, as you do no matter what tools you're using to work on anything you don't want to break. –  gregmac Oct 21 '11 at 16:26\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/9646/how-do-i-use-precision-screwdrivers&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.05055814981460571,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.050558&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9025173783302308\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;30348\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:Z7NPNTLLWYKC46X5KJSYDQUYODVRTGKM\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:2ae01786-a1b0-4ff5-b5a6-0d7b990ca7bd>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T14:46:53\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;130.89.3.180\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:MQWLDTMNP52FM24BKHKBZGDFE266U5AQ\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:3471bb57-137a-4bc0-9fb8-1535b451b6c6>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://doc.utwente.nl/58724/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:223,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;223&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Asymmetrical learning between a tactile and visual serial RT task\n\n\nAbrahamse, Elger L. and Lubbe van der, Rob H.J. and Verwey, Willem B.

ISSN 1747-0218\n\nRestricted to UT campus only\n: Request a copy\nAbstract:According to many researchers, implicit learning in the serial reaction-time task is predominantly motor based and therefore should be independent of stimulus modality. Previous research on the task, however, has focused almost completely on the visual domain. Here we investigated sequence learning when the imperative stimuli were presented tactilely to the fingers. Learning in this task was compared to sequence learning in a typical visual task, using very similar experimental conditions. The results indicate that sequential learning occurs in the tactile task, though to a lesser degree than in its visual counterpart. Furthermore, there was similar cross-modal transfer in both directions, meaning that transfer from the visual to the tactile task was partial. It is proposed that sequence learning involves a stimulus-specific component in the visual but not in the tactile task.\nItem Type:Article\nCopyright:© 2007 The Experimental Psychology Society\nBehavioural Sciences (BS)\nResearch Group:\nLink to this item:\nOfficial URL:\nExport this item as:BibTeX\nHTML Citation\nReference Manager\n\n\nRepository Staff Only: item control page\n\nMetis ID: 243471&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://doc.utwente.nl/58724/&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1056789755821228,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.105679&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:64,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;64&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.818959653377533\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;31148\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:HZHMP57EOCOE5XFNFHHCFG46QCQDL645\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:28513cf9-6d7c-4813-85a0-6e9bf3207830>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:50:55\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;23.0.160.198\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:BJB3RKT6RJSIIRP6KKQCQIUJH27CR75D\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:4e529484-e5af-4086-ad24-05faea4a648c>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e22489/manpreins.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1991,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,991&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Skip Headers\nOracle® Grid Infrastructure Installation Guide\n11g Release 2 (11.2) for Linux\n\nGo to Documentation Home\nGo to Book List\nBook List\nGo to Table of Contents\nGo to Index\nGo to Master Index\nMaster Index\nGo to Feedback page\nContact Us\n\nGo to previous page\nGo to next page\nPDF · Mobi · ePub\n\nE How to Complete Installation Prerequisite Tasks Manually\n\nThis appendix provides instructions for how to complete configuration tasks manually that Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) and the installer (OUI) normally complete during installation. Use this appendix as a guide if you cannot use the fixup script.\n\nThis appendix contains the following information:\n\nE.1 Configuring SSH Manually on All Cluster Nodes\n\nPasswordless SSH configuration is a mandatory installation requirement. SSH is used during installation to configure cluster member nodes, and SSH is used after installation by configuration assistants, Oracle Enterprise Manager, OPatch, and other features.\n\nAutomatic Passwordless SSH configuration using OUI creates RSA encryption keys on all nodes of the cluster. If you have system restrictions that require you to set up SSH manually, such as using DSA keys, then use this procedure as a guide to set up passwordless SSH.\n\nIn the examples that follow, the Oracle software owner listed is the grid user.\n\nIf SSH is not available, then OUI attempts to use rsh and rcp instead. However, these services are disabled by default on most Linux systems.\n\n\nThe supported version of SSH for Linux distributions is OpenSSH.\n\nThis section contains the following:\n\nE.1.1 Checking Existing SSH Configuration on the System\n\nTo determine if SSH is running, enter the following command:\n\n$ pgrep sshd\n\nIf SSH is running, then the response to this command is one or more process ID numbers. In the home directory of the installation software owner (grid, oracle), use the command ls -al to ensure that the .ssh directory is owned and writable only by the user.\n\nYou need either an RSA or a DSA key for the SSH protocol. RSA is used with the SSH 1.5 protocol, while DSA is the default for the SSH 2.0 protocol. With OpenSSH, you can use either RSA or DSA. The instructions that follow are for SSH1. If you have an SSH2 installation, and you cannot use SSH1, then refer to your SSH distribution documentation to configure SSH1 compatibility or to configure SSH2 with DSA.\n\nE.1.2 Configuring SSH on Cluster Nodes\n\nTo configure SSH, you must first create RSA or DSA keys on each cluster node, and then copy all the keys generated on all cluster node members into an authorized keys file that is identical on each node. Note that the SSH files must be readable only by root and by the software installation user (oracle, grid), as SSH ignores a private key file if it is accessible by others. In the examples that follow, the DSA key is used.\n\nYou must configure SSH separately for each Oracle software installation owner that you intend to use for installation.\n\nTo configure SSH, complete the following:\n\nE.1.2.1 Create SSH Directory, and Create SSH Keys On Each Node\n\nComplete the following steps on each node:\n\n  1. Log in as the software owner (in this example, the grid user).\n\n  2. To ensure that you are logged in as grid, and to verify that the user ID matches the expected user ID you have assigned to the grid user, enter the commands id and id grid. Ensure that Oracle user group and user and the user terminal window process you are using have group and user IDs are identical. For example:\n\n    $ id \n    uid=502(grid) gid=501(oinstall) groups=501(oinstall),502(grid,asmadmin,asmdba)\n    $ id grid\n  3. If necessary, create the .ssh directory in the grid user's home directory, and set permissions on it to ensure that only the oracle user has read and write permissions:\n\n    $ mkdir ~/.ssh\n    $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh\n\n\n    SSH configuration will fail if the permissions are not set to 700.\n  4. Enter the following command:\n\n    $ /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t dsa\n\n    At the prompts, accept the default location for the key file (press Enter).\n\n\n    SSH with passphrase is not supported for Oracle Clusterware 11g release 2 and later releases.\n\n    This command writes the DSA public key to the ~/.ssh/ file and the private key to the ~/.ssh/id_dsa file.\n\n    Never distribute the private key to anyone not authorized to perform Oracle software installations.\n\n  5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 on each node that you intend to make a member of the cluster, using the DSA key.\n\nE.1.2.2 Add All Keys to a Common authorized_keys File\n\nComplete the following steps:\n\n  1. On the local node, change directories to the .ssh directory in the Oracle Grid Infrastructure owner's home directory (typically, either grid or oracle).\n\n    Then, add the DSA key to the authorized_keys file using the following commands:\n\n    $ cat >> authorized_keys\n    $ ls\n\n    In the ssh directory, you should see the keys that you have created, and the file authorized_keys.\n\n  2. On the local node, use SCP (Secure Copy) or SFTP (Secure FTP) to copy the authorized_keys file to the oracle user .ssh directory on a remote node. The following example is with SCP, on a node called node2, with the Oracle Grid Infrastructure owner grid, where the grid user path is /home/grid:\n\n    [grid@node1 .ssh]$ scp authorized_keys node2:/home/grid/.ssh/\n\n    You are prompted to accept a DSA key. Enter Yes, and you see that the node you are copying to is added to the known_hosts file.\n\n    When prompted, provide the password for the grid user, which should be the same on all nodes in the cluster. The authorized_keys file is copied to the remote node.\n\n    Your output should be similar to the following, where xxx represents parts of a valid IP address:\n\n    The authenticity of host 'node2 ( can't be established.\n    DSA key fingerprint is 7e:60:60:ae:40:40:d1:a6:f7:4e:zz:me:a7:48:ae:f6:7e.\n    Warning: Permanently added 'node1,' (dsa) to the list\n    of known hosts\n    grid@node2's password:\n    authorized_keys       100%             828             7.5MB/s      00:00\n  3. Using SSH, log in to the node where you copied the authorized_keys file. Then change to the .ssh directory, and using the cat command, add the DSA keys for the second node to the authorized_keys file, clicking Enter when you are prompted for a password, so that passwordless SSH is set up:\n\n    [grid@node1 .ssh]$ ssh node2\n    [grid@node2 grid]$ cd .ssh\n    [grid@node2 ssh]$ cat  >> authorized_keys\n\n    Repeat steps 2 and 3 from each node to each other member node in the cluster.\n\n    When you have added keys from each cluster node member to the authorized_keys file on the last node you want to have as a cluster node member, then use scp to copy the authorized_keys file with the keys from all nodes back to each cluster node member, overwriting the existing version on the other nodes.\n\n    To confirm that you have all nodes in the authorized_keys file, enter the command more authorized_keys, and determine if there is a DSA key for each member node. The file lists the type of key (ssh-dsa), followed by the key, and then followed by the user and server. For example:\n\n    ssh-dsa AAAABBBB . . . = grid@node1\n\n\n    The grid user's /.ssh/authorized_keys file on every node must contain the contents from all of the /.ssh/ files that you generated on all cluster nodes.\n\nE.1.3 Enabling SSH User Equivalency on Cluster Nodes\n\nAfter you have copied the authorized_keys file that contains all keys to each node in the cluster, complete the following procedure, in the order listed. In this example, the Oracle Grid Infrastructure software owner is named grid:\n\n  1. On the system where you want to run OUI, log in as the grid user.\n\n  2. Use the following command syntax, where hostname1, hostname2, and so on, are the public host names (alias and fully qualified domain name) of nodes in the cluster to run SSH from the local node to each node, including from the local node to itself, and from each node to each other node:\n\n    [grid@nodename]$ ssh hostname1 date\n    [grid@nodename]$ ssh hostname2 date\n\n    For example:\n\n    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh node1 date\n    The authenticity of host 'node1 (' can't be established.\n    DSA key fingerprint is 7z:60:60:zz:48:48:z1:a0:f7:4e.\n    Warning: Permanently added 'node1,' (DSA) to the list of\n    known hosts.\n    Mon Dec 4 11:08:13 PST 2006\n    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh date\n    The authenticity of host ' (' can't be\n    Warning: Permanently added ',' (DSA) to the\n    list of known hosts.\n    Mon Dec 4 11:08:13 PST 2006\n    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh node2 date\n    Mon Dec 4 11:08:35 PST 2006\n\n    At the end of this process, the public host name for each member node should be registered in the known_hosts file for all other cluster nodes.\n\n    If you are using a remote client to connect to the local node, and you see a message similar to \&quot;Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding,\&quot; then this means that your authorized keys file is configured correctly, but your SSH configuration has X11 forwarding enabled. To correct this issue, proceed to \&quot;Setting Display and X11 Forwarding Configuration\&quot;.\n\n  3. Repeat step 2 on each cluster node member.\n\nIf you have configured SSH correctly, then you can now use the ssh or scp commands without being prompted for a password. For example:\n\n[grid@node1 ~]$ ssh node2 date\nMon Feb 26 23:34:42 UTC 2009\n[grid@node1 ~]$ ssh node1 date\nMon Feb 26 23:34:48 UTC 2009\n\nIf any node prompts for a password, then verify that the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on that node contains the correct public keys, and that you have created an Oracle software owner with identical group membership and IDs.\n\nE.2 Configuring Kernel Parameters\n\nThis section contains the following:\n\n\nThe kernel parameter and shell limit values shown in the following section are recommended values only. For production database systems, Oracle recommends that you tune these values to optimize the performance of the system. Refer to your operating system documentation for more information about tuning kernel parameters.\n\nE.2.1 Minimum Parameter Settings for Installation\n\nDuring installation, or when you run the Cluster Verification Utility (cluvfy) with the flag -fixup, a fixup script is generated. This script updates required kernel packages if necessary to minimum values.\n\nIf you cannot use the fixup scripts, then review the following table to set values manually:\n\nParameter Value File\nsemmsl semmns semopm semmni 250 32000 100 128 /proc/sys/kernel/sem\nshmmax Minimum allocation:\n\n536870912 (512 MB)\n\nMaximum allocation:\n\n  • Linux x86: At least 1 byte less than 4 GB, or 4294967295.\n\n    Recommended: More than half the physical memory.\n\n  • Linux x86-64: At least 1 byte less than the physical memory\n\n    Recommended: More than half the physical memory\n\nSee My Oracle Support Note 567506.1 for additional information about configuring shmmax.\n\nshmmni 4096 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni\nshmall 2097152 /proc/sys/kernel/shmall\nfile-max 6815744 /proc/sys/fs/file-max\nip_local_port_range Minimum: 9000\n\nMaximum: 65500\n\nrmem_default 262144 /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default\nrmem_max 4194304 /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\nwmem_default 262144 /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default\nwmem_max 1048576 /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max\naio-max-nr 1048576 /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr\n\n\nIf the current value for any parameter is greater than the value listed in this table, then the Fixup scripts do not change the value of that parameter.\n\nE.2.2 Additional Parameter and Kernel Settings for SUSE Linux\n\nOn SUSE systems only, complete the following steps as needed:\n\n  1. Enter the following command to cause the system to read the /etc/sysctl.conf file when it restarts:\n\n    # /sbin/chkconfig boot.sysctl on\n  2. On SUSE 10 systems only, use a text editor to change the /etc/sysconfig/boot.sysctl parameter RUN_PARALLEL flag from yes to no.\n\n  3. Enter the GID of the oinstall group as the value for the parameter /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group. Doing this grants members of oinstall a group permission to create shared memory segments.\n\n    For example, where the oinstall group GID is 501:\n\n    # echo 501 > /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group\n\n    After running this command, use vi to add the following text to /etc/sysctl.conf, and enable the boot.sysctl script to run on system restart:\n\n\n\n    Only one group can be defined as the vm.hugetlb_shm_group.\n  4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 on all other nodes in the cluster.\n\nE.3 Checking OCFS2 Version Manually\n\nTo check your OCFS version manually, enter the following commands:\n\nmodinfo ocfs2\nrpm -qa |grep ocfs2\n\nEnsure that ocfs2console and ocfs2-tools are at least version 1.2.7, and that the other OCFS2 components correspond to the pattern ocfs2-kernel_version-1.2.7 or greater. If you want to install Oracle RAC on a shared home, then the OCFS version must be 1.4.1 or greater.\n\nFor information about OCFS2, refer to the following Web site:&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e22489/manpreins.htm&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.1278235912322998,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.127824&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.7854194641113281\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;4555\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:64WTFDHFNCOVN3RO4GD52CPOFTIV23BJ\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:daa48ef2-edff-4563-8fd9-e129340a59b9>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:17:10\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;23.0.160.208\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:DJ6PFFG3CLRSXYLSKXZU3XPBH4IY2V53\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:e3858301-08e8-4f28-a745-3fc987178986>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7228/fstroublefsck-23/index.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:108,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;108&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System Administration Guide, Volume 1\n\nHow to See If a File System Needs Checking\n\n  1.

So you see Fred soon got the name of “sel fish Fred.” Well, when he be came a man he still took care of self.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod is in heaven; and can hear\n\nA feeble prayer like mine?\n\nYes, little child, thou needest not fear,\n\nHe listens now to thine.\n\nGod is in heaven; and can he see\n\nWhen I am doing wrong?\n\nYes, child, he can—he looks at thee\n\nAll day, and all night long.\n\nGod in heaven and would he know\n\nIf I should tell a lie?\n\nYes, if thou saids't it e'er so low,\n\nHe'd hear it in the sky.\n\nGod is in heaven; and can I go\n\nTo thank him for his care?\n\nNot yet—but love him here below,\n\nAnd thou shalt praise him there.\n\n\n\n2. I have tried to teach you some-thing use-ful, as well as how to spell and read.—Is is ver-y im-por-tant to learn to im-prove what we read.\n\n\n\n5. This much for these lit-tle boys, and girls who have kind friends to send them to school.— But what shall we say to those poor lit-tle chil-dren whose pa-rents are too poor to help them get an ed u ca-tion? Poor chil-dren!\n\n\n\n\nAdieu, at present.\n\nI'M NOT TOO YOUNG FOR GOD TO SEE. “I'm not too young for God to see, He knows my name and nature too; And all day long, he looks at me, And sees my actions through and thro.' He listens to the words I say, And knows the thoughts I have within, And whether I am at work or play He's sure to know it if I sin. O, how could children tell a lie, Or cheat in play, or steal or fight, If they remembered God was nigh, And had them always in his sight. Then when I want to do amiss, However pleasant it may be, I'll always strive to think of this— I'm not too young for God to see.”\n\n[Back Cover Image]&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/moore2/moore.xml&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.05268579721450806,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.052686&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9840303659439088\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;23076\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:3VX5NCWH43ONCBBTDYRDNDGDTG23UW22\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:fd575475-c34d-479f-af3d-a5cbb37f2dcd>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:18:14\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;129.127.44.60\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:P26XSEFRHI3Y5SEYJD6GJHTTCIOPVLBB\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:760dd7c7-c187-436b-a80c-b3efe6e84b4c>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/v/verne/jules/v52st/chapter28.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: \&quot;length\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3370,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3,370&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Michael Strogoff, by Jules Verne\n\nChapter XI\n\nBetween Two Banks\n\nBY eight in the evening, the country, as the state of the sky had foretold, was enveloped in complete darkness. The moon being new had not yet risen. From the middle of the river the banks were invisible. The cliffs were confounded with the heavy, low-hanging clouds. At intervals a puff of wind came from the east, but it soon died away in the narrow valley of the Angara.\n\nThe darkness could not fail to favor in a considerable degree the plans of the fugitives. Indeed, although the Tartar outposts must have been drawn up on both banks, the raft had a good chance of passing unperceived. It was not likely either that the besiegers would have barred the river above Irkutsk, since they knew that the Russians could not expect any help from the south of the province. Besides this, before long Nature would herself establish a barrier, by cementing with frost the blocks of ice accumulated between the two banks.\n\nPerfect silence now reigned on board the raft. The voices of the pilgrims were no longer heard. They still prayed, but their prayer was but a murmur, which could not reach as far as either bank. The fugitives lay flat on the platform, so that the raft was scarcely above the level of the water. The old boatman crouched down forward among his men, solely occupied in keeping off the ice blocks, a maneuver which was performed without noise.\n\nThe drifting of the ice was a favorable circumstance so long as it did not offer an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the raft. If that object had been alone on the water, it would have run a risk of being seen, even in the darkness, but, as it was, it was confounded with these moving masses, of all shapes and sizes, and the tumult caused by the crashing of the blocks against each other concealed likewise any suspicious noises.\n\nThere was a sharp frost. The fugitives suffered cruelly, having no other shelter than a few branches of birch. They cowered down together, endeavoring to keep each other warm, the temperature being now ten degrees below freezing point. The wind, though slight, having passed over the snow-clad mountains of the east, pierced them through and through.\n\nMichael and Nadia, lying in the afterpart of the raft, bore this increase of suffering without complaint. Jolivet and Blount, placed near them, stood these first assaults of the Siberian winter as well as they could. No one now spoke, even in a low voice. Their situation entirely absorbed them. At any moment an incident might occur, which they could not escape unscathed.\n\nFor a man who hoped soon to accomplish his mission, Michael was singularly calm. Even in the gravest conjunctures, his energy had never abandoned him. He already saw the moment when he would be at last allowed to think of his mother, of Nadia, of himself! He now only dreaded one final unhappy chance; this was, that the raft might be completely barred by ice before reaching Irkutsk. He thought but of this, determined beforehand, if necessary, to attempt some bold stroke.\n\nRestored by a few hours’ rest, Nadia had regained the physical energy which misery had sometimes overcome, although without ever having shaken her moral energy. She thought, too, that if Michael had to make any fresh effort to attain his end, she must be there to guide him. But in proportion as she drew nearer to Irkutsk, the image of her father rose more and more clearly before her mind. She saw him in the invested town, far from those he loved, but, as she never doubted, struggling against the invaders with all the spirit of his patriotism. In a few hours, if Heaven favored them, she would be in his arms, giving him her mother’s last words, and nothing should ever separate them again. If the term of Wassili Fedor’s exile should never come to an end, his daughter would remain exiled with him. Then, by a natural transition, she came back to him who would have enabled her to see her father once more, to that generous companion, that “brother,” who, the Tartars driven back, would retake the road to Moscow, whom she would perhaps never meet again!\n\nAs to Alcide Jolivet and Harry Blount, they had one and the same thought, which was, that the situation was extremely dramatic, and that, well worked up, it would furnish a most deeply interesting article. The Englishman thought of the readers of the Daily Telegraph, and the Frenchman of those of his Cousin Madeleine. At heart, both were not without feeling some emotion.\n\n“Well, so much the better!” thought Alcide Jolivet, “to move others, one must be moved one’s self! I believe there is some celebrated verse on the subject, but hang me if I can recollect it!” And with his well-practiced eyes he endeavored to pierce the gloom of the river.\n\nEvery now and then a burst of light dispelling the darkness for a time, exhibited the banks under some fantastic aspect — either a forest on fire, or a still burning village. The Angara was occasionally illuminated from one bank to the other. The blocks of ice formed so many mirrors, which, reflecting the flames on every point and in every color, were whirled along by the caprice of the current. The raft passed unperceived in the midst of these floating masses.\n\nThe danger was not at these points.\n\nBut a peril of another nature menaced the fugitives. One that they could not foresee, and, above all, one that they could not avoid. Chance discovered it to Alcide Jolivet in this way:— Lying at the right side of the raft, he let his hand hang over into the water. Suddenly he was surprised by the impression made on it by the current. It seemed to be of a slimy consistency, as if it had been made of mineral oil. Alcide, aiding his touch by his sense of smell, could not be mistaken. It was really a layer of liquid naphtha, floating on the surface of the river!\n\nWas the raft really floating on this substance, which is in the highest degree combustible? Where had this naphtha come from? Was it a natural phenomenon taking place on the surface of the Angara, or was it to serve as an engine of destruction, put in motion by the Tartars? Did they intend to carry conflagration into Irkutsk?\n\nSuch were the questions which Alcide asked himself, but he thought it best to make this incident known only to Harry Blount, and they both agreed in not alarming their companions by revealing to them this new danger.\n\nIt is known that the soil of Central Asia is like a sponge impregnated with liquid hydrogen. At the port of Bakou, on the Persian frontier, on the Caspian Sea, in Asia Minor, in China, on the Yuen-Kiang, in the Burman Empire, springs of mineral oil rise in thousands to the surface of the ground. It is an “oil country,” similar to the one which bears this name in North America.\n\nDuring certain religious festivals, principally at the port of Bakou, the natives, who are fire-worshipers, throw liquid naphtha on the surface of the sea, which buoys it up, its density being inferior to that of water. Then at nightfall, when a layer of mineral oil is thus spread over the Caspian, they light it, and exhibit the matchless spectacle of an ocean of fire undulating and breaking into waves under the breeze.\n\nBut what is only a sign of rejoicing at Bakou, might prove a fearful disaster on the waters of the Angara. Whether it was set on fire by malevolence or imprudence, in the twinkling of an eye a conflagration might spread beyond Irkutsk. On board the raft no imprudence was to be feared; but everything was to be dreaded from the conflagrations on both banks of the Angara, for should a lighted straw or even a spark blow into the water, it would inevitably set the whole current of naphtha in a blaze.\n\nThe apprehensions of Jolivet and Blount may be better understood than described. Would it not be prudent, in face of this new danger, to land on one of the banks and wait there? “At any rate,” said Alcide, “whatever the danger may be, I know some one who will not land!”\n\nHe alluded to Michael Strogoff.\n\nIn the meantime, on glided the raft among the masses of ice which were gradually getting closer and closer together. Up till then, no Tartar detachment had been seen, which showed that the raft was not abreast of the outposts. At about ten o’clock, however, Harry Blount caught sight of a number of black objects moving on the ice blocks. Springing from one to the other, they rapidly approached.\n\n“Tartars!” he thought. And creeping up to the old boatman, he pointed out to him the suspicious objects.\n\nThe old man looked attentively. “They are only wolves!” said he. “I like them better than Tartars. But we must defend ourselves, and without noise!”\n\nThe fugitives would indeed have to defend themselves against these ferocious beasts, whom hunger and cold had sent roaming through the province. They had smelt out the raft, and would soon attack it. The fugitives must struggle without using firearms, for they could not now be far from the Tartar posts. The women and children were collected in the middle of the raft, and the men, some armed with poles, others with their knives, stood prepared to repulse their assailants. They did not make a sound, but the howls of the wolves filled the air.\n\nMichael did not wish to remain inactive. He lay down at the side attacked by the savage pack. He drew his knife, and every time that a wolf passed within his reach, his hand found out the way to plunge his weapon into its throat. Neither were Jolivet and Blount idle, but fought bravely with the brutes. Their companions gallantly seconded them. The battle was carried on in silence, although many of the fugitives received severe bites.\n\nThe struggle did not appear as if it would soon terminate. The pack was being continually reinforced from the right bank of the Angara. “This will never be finished!” said Alcide, brandishing his dagger, red with blood.\n\nIn fact, half an hour after the commencement of the attack, the wolves were still coming in hundreds across the ice. The exhausted fugitives were getting weaker. The fight was going against them. At that moment, a group of ten huge wolves, raging with hunger, their eyes glowing in the darkness like red coals, sprang onto the raft. Jolivet and his companion threw themselves into the midst of the fierce beasts, and Michael was finding his way towards them, when a sudden change took place.\n\nIn a few moments the wolves had deserted not only the raft, but also the ice on the river. All the black bodies dispersed, and it was soon certain that they had in all haste regained the shore. Wolves, like other beasts of prey, require darkness for their proceedings, and at that moment a bright light illuminated the entire river.\n\nIt was the blaze of an immense fire. The whole of the small town of Poshkavsk was burning. The Tartars were indeed there, finishing their work. From this point, they occupied both banks beyond Irkutsk. The fugitives had by this time reached the dangerous part of their voyage, and they were still twenty miles from the capital.\n\nIt was now half past eleven. The raft continued to glide on amongst the ice, with which it was quite mingled, but gleams of light sometimes fell upon it. The fugitives stretched on the platform did not permit themselves to make a movement by which they might be betrayed.\n\nThe conflagration was going on with frightful rapidity. The houses, built of fir-wood, blazed like torches — a hundred and fifty flaming at once. With the crackling of the fire was mingled the yells of the Tartars. The old boatman, getting a foothold on a near piece of ice, managed to shove the raft towards the right bank, by doing which a distance of from three to four hundred feet divided it from the flames of Poshkavsk.\n\nNevertheless, the fugitives, lighted every now and then by the glare, would have been undoubtedly perceived had not the incendiaries been too much occupied in their work of destruction.\n\nIt may be imagined what were the apprehensions of Jolivet and Blount, when they thought of the combustible liquid on which the raft floated. Sparks flew in millions from the houses, which resembled so many glowing furnaces. They rose among the volumes of smoke to a height of five or six hundred feet. On the right bank, the trees and cliffs exposed to the fire looked as if they likewise were burning. A spark falling on the surface of the Angara would be sufficient to spread the flames along the current, and to carry disaster from one bank to the other. The result of this would be in a short time the destruction of the raft and of all those which it carried.\n\nBut, happily, the breeze did not blow from that side. It came from the east, and drove the flames towards the left. It was just possible that the fugitives would escape this danger. The blazing town was at last passed. Little by little the glare grew dimmer, the crackling became fainter, and the flames at last disappeared behind the high cliffs which arose at an abrupt turn of the river.\n\nBy this time it was nearly midnight. The deep gloom again threw its protecting shadows over the raft. The Tartars were there, going to and fro near the river. They could not be seen, but they could be heard. The fires of the outposts burned brightly.\n\nIn the meantime it had become necessary to steer more carefully among the blocks of ice. The old boatman stood up, and the moujiks resumed their poles. They had plenty of work, the management of the raft becoming more and more difficult as the river was further obstructed.\n\nMichael had crept forward; Jolivet followed; both listened to what the old boatman and his men were saying.\n\n“Look out on the right!”\n\n“There are blocks drifting on to us on the left!”\n\n“Fend! fend off with your boat-hook!”\n\n“Before an hour is past we shall be stopped!”\n\n“If it is God’s will!” answered the old man. “Against His will there is nothing to be done.”\n\n“You hear them,” said Alcide.\n\n“Yes,” replied Michael, “but God is with us!”\n\nThe situation became more and more serious. Should the raft be stopped, not only would the fugitives not reach Irkutsk, but they would be obliged to leave their floating platform, for it would be very soon smashed to pieces in the ice. The osier ropes would break, the fir trunks torn asunder would drift under the hard crust, and the unhappy people would have no refuge but the ice blocks themselves. Then, when day came, they would be seen by the Tartars, and massacred without mercy!\n\nMichael returned to the spot where Nadia was waiting for him. He approached the girl, took her hand, and put to her the invariable question: “Nadia, are you ready?” to which she replied as usual, “I am ready!”\n\nFor a few versts more the raft continued to drift amongst the floating ice. Should the river narrow, it would soon form an impassable barrier. Already they seemed to drift slower. Every moment they encountered severe shocks or were compelled to make detours; now, to avoid running foul of a block, there to enter a channel, of which it was necessary to take advantage. At length the stoppages became still more alarming. There were only a few more hours of night. Could the fugitives not reach Irkutsk by five o’clock in the morning, they must lose all hope of ever getting there at all.\n\nAt half-past one, notwithstanding all efforts, the raft came up against a thick barrier and stuck fast. The ice, which was drifting down behind it, pressed it still closer, and kept it motionless, as though it had been stranded.\n\nAt this spot the Angara narrowed, it being half its usual breadth. This was the cause of the accumulation of ice, which became gradually soldered together, under the double influence of the increased pressure and of the cold. Five hundred feet beyond, the river widened again, and the blocks, gradually detaching themselves from the floe, continued to drift towards Irkutsk. It was probable that had the banks not narrowed, the barrier would not have formed. But the misfortune was irreparable, and the fugitives must give up all hope of attaining their object.\n\nHad they possessed the tools usually employed by whalers to cut channels through the ice-fields — had they been able to get through to where the river widened — they might have been saved. But they had nothing which could make the least incision in the ice, hard as granite in the excessive frost. What were they to do?\n\nAt that moment several shots on the right bank startled the unhappy fugitives. A shower of balls fell on the raft. The devoted passengers had been seen. Immediately afterwards shots were heard fired from the left bank. The fugitives, taken between two fires, became the mark of the Tartar sharpshooters. Several were wounded, although in the darkness it was only by chance that they were hit.\n\n“Come, Nadia,” whispered Michael in the girl’s ear.\n\nWithout making a single remark, “ready for anything,” Nadia took Michael’s hand.\n\n“We must cross the barrier,” he said in a low tone. “Guide me, but let no one see us leave the raft.”\n\nNadia obeyed. Michael and she glided rapidly over the floe in the obscurity, only broken now and again by the flashes from the muskets. Nadia crept along in front of Michael. The shot fell around them like a tempest of hail, and pattered on the ice. Their hands were soon covered with blood from the sharp and rugged ice over which they clambered, but still on they went.\n\nIn ten minutes, the other side of the barrier was reached. There the waters of the Angara again flowed freely. Several pieces of ice, detached gradually from the floe, were swept along in the current down towards the town. Nadia guessed what Michael wished to attempt. One of the blocks was only held on by a narrow strip.\n\n“Come,” said Nadia. And the two crouched on the piece of ice, which their weight detached from the floe.\n\nIt began to drift. The river widened, the way was open. Michael and Nadia heard the shots, the cries of distress, the yells of the Tartars. Then, little by little, the sounds of agony and of ferocious joy grew faint in the distance.\n\n“Our poor companions!” murmured Nadia.\n\nFor half an hour the current hurried along the block of ice which bore Michael and Nadia. They feared every moment that it would give way beneath them. Swept along in the middle of the current, it was unnecessary to give it an oblique direction until they drew near the quays of Irkutsk. Michael, his teeth tight set, his ear on the strain, did not utter a word. Never had he been so near his object. He felt that he was about to attain it!\n\nTowards two in the morning a double row of lights glittered on the dark horizon in which were confounded the two banks of the Angara. On the right hand were the lights of Irkutsk; on the left, the fires of the Tartar camp.\n\nMichael Strogoff was not more than half a verst from the town. “At last!” he murmured.\n\nBut suddenly Nadia uttered a cry.\n\nAt the cry Michael stood up on the ice, which was wavering. His hand was extended up the Angara. His face, on which a bluish light cast a peculiar hue, became almost fearful to look at, and then, as if his eyes had been opened to the bright blaze spreading across the river, “Ah!” he exclaimed, “then Heaven itself is against us!”\n\n\nLast updated Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 18:24&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/v/verne/jules/v52st/chapter28.html&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.04622304439544678,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.046223&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;bff_contained_ngram_count_before_dedupe&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;language_id_whole_page_fasttext&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en\&quot;: 0.9496085047721864\n}&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;Content-Length\&quot;: \&quot;23822\&quot;,\n  \&quot;Content-Type\&quot;: \&quot;application/http; msgtype=response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Block-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:PZYSRA7R4EUMWCIOQWRWLSXBX4WYYTII\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Concurrent-To\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:70438e01-8920-4d16-898f-3c6a219c3d85>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Date\&quot;: \&quot;2014-03-13T15:34:17\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-IP-Address\&quot;: \&quot;67.208.46.136\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Identified-Payload-Type\&quot;: null,\n  \&quot;WARC-Payload-Digest\&quot;: \&quot;sha1:OVOUQTNZLSIG5MTZ7SRI55W7FP3CS2R5\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Record-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:5df68bfc-1cd6-438a-b4d4-3bc7dd2f683e>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Target-URI\&quot;: \&quot;http://ecmweb.com/print/cee-news-archive/breaching-digital-bottleneck\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Type\&quot;: \&quot;response\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Warcinfo-ID\&quot;: \&quot;<urn:uuid:b5e3a9ec-69eb-4339-b321-68508bcb76fa>\&quot;,\n  \&quot;WARC-Truncated\&quot;: null\n}&quot;},&quot;previous_word_count&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1476,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,476&quot;},&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Imagine processing 400-billion pieces of information per second! Sound impossible? That's exactly how fast backbones used by today's Internet providers operate-at speeds of up to 400 gigabits of data per second. What's more, in a year or two, they'll be even faster. However, this state-of-the art technology does not exist everywhere. In the real world, our high-tech offices appear to \&quot;blaze\&quot; at a tortoise-paced 1.5 megabits per second, and the last link to the home struggles along at a snail-paced 30 or 40 thousand bits per second. So while the computer gurus of Silicon Valley want to provide many things to us, this \&quot;last-mile\&quot; problem continues to tie them down.\n\nThis situation continues because the government protects local telephone companies (Telcos) from competition. Since there's no reason to change, they continue to make big money leasing 1.54-megabit lines to businesses. (Called T1 lines, these can cost from several hundred dollars to more than $1000 per month). In addition to this lucrative leasing business, Telcos also profit from multiple phone lines in residences.\n\nIf the Telcos allowed prices for bandwidth (the amount of signal sent from one place to another) to keep up with technology, they'd lose a ton of revenue. Remember, you and I cannot go into the telephone business. If we tried to open up a second (and better) telephone company, the government would shut down our company, confiscate our assets, and possibly send us to jail! Since competition is forbidden, normal market forces are not at work here.\n\nThe coming \&quot;end-run\&quot; years. Because of this Telco bottleneck as well as the inherent inefficiency of the telephone network (designed for the world of 1930, not the 21st century), the new world wide Internet data network simply cannot push through the morass of local telephone company systems. Instead, it's leapfrogging the telephone systems any way it can. This occurs in the following ways:\n\nThrough-cable television systems. This is a very good method from a technological standpoint; cable TV is a large pre-existing system with the proper type of architecture. Nonetheless, it's still pretty questionable whether the cable TV system will provide a good last-mile link. There are two main problems: (1) Because the government regulates cable TV, Telcos will probably donate enough money to politicians to make sure restrictions on the cable companies never go away. (2) Cable TV companies themselves have been rather predatory, generating significant ill will among customers. In fact, many people would rather not do business with them at all (if they had a choice).\n\nVia satellite. Right now, there are several high-speed data satellite systems under construction that can deliver data to a home or office at rates well into the megabit per second range (perhaps even into the gigabit range). However, these systems will probably not be fully operational until 2002. After that time, they should effectively make an end-run around the Telco system. Currently, it appears they have not been restricted by the government. Therefore, there's probably not enough time left for Congress to shut them out of the market.\n\nDSL. This is a telephone technology (as opposed to a data technology) called Digital Subscriber Line. It uses electronic boxes on each end of a standard telephone line to achieve speeds of up to 1.5 megabits per second. This technology comes in several flavors (ADSL, HDSL, etc.); however, they all are somewhat similar. Whether this will ever by implemented is questionable. It's really not in their best interest to do so, and Telcos might not readily embrace the technology. For example, Telcos left ISDN, the predecessor of DSL, to die on the vine. The same fate may await DSL. We'll just have to wait and see. Digital power line (DPL). This new technology uses a spread-spectrum power-line carrier technology to send up to 1.5 megabits (and in some cases more) over standard power lines. This system will probably be too limited for use 10 years from now, but it could be a major factor for the next five to eight years. As far as this author knows, there is no legislation limiting the use of this technology. Besides, it operates over existing power wiring, which is an enormous advantage.\n\nHow the DPL works. To send over a million bits per second through power lines, DPL uses what is termed a high-frequency conditioned power network (HFCPN). Rather than trying to push one signal very fast through the power lines, it breaks the signal into multiple streams, each of which is sent through the power system on a different frequency. Special receivers combine the mini-streams of data back into the original signal configuration.\n\nThese networks are rather complex but extremely stable and tolerant of electrical noise. They can provide between 6 MHz and 10 MHz of usable spectrum to far-end customers and more than 20 MHz of usable spectrum to near-end customers, for peak signal power levels of between 1mW and 10 mW. The overall spectral efficiency of the network depends upon a number of things, including:\n\n* Customer type and number per distribution unit (typically up to 50).\n\n* Type of multiple access requirements (dedicated or switched).\n\n* Service requirement (voice, data, still or moving pictures, etc.).\n\n* Digital or analog transmission technology.\n\n* Modulation, coding, and compression schemes (data bits per unit of available spectrum).\n\n* Traffic density mean and peak.\n\nUnder this scheme, you terminate the network interconnection conductors in a three-port directional coupler, known as a conditioning unit (CU) (Fig. 1). The basic elements of the CU are shown in Fig. 2 and include both high- and low-pass filter sections interconnected to form a frequency sensitive directional coupler, which has a network port (NP), communication distribution port (CDP), and electricity distribution port (EDP)\n\nThese CUs provide for the following:\n\n* Safe and efficient interconnection of signals at speeds greater than 1 MHz.\n\n* Directional propagation of signals.\n\n* A reduced noise floor above 1 MHz.\n\n* Isolation of variable customer loads.\n\n* Suitable network service termination points for electricity and telecommunication services.\n\n* Optimum spectral performance of the cable network.\n\nImplementation. To implement DPL, utilities will require an investment in equipment and training. However, this investment will allow utilities to get into the Internet provider market more quickly.\n\nThe number of electrical utilities who will want to jump on this bandwagon is questionable, but you can certainly make plenty of money in these markets. Because the electrical utility market in the United States is deregulating for the first time, there are plenty of changes on the horizon. Most notably, competition will enter the market for the first time. As power markets become competitive, taking advantage of new opportunities will become important, and utilities will take a careful look at technologies like DPL. Hopefully, they will implement them quickly.\n\nThe possible utility company end-run. Earlier, we discussed methods of making end-runs around the last-mile data bottleneck. If they choose to do so, electric utility companies could provide a terrific way to get high-speed data to the house or office. They already have cables entering every home and office, and they have plenty of expertise running cables over long distances.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why it makes sense for electric utilities to deliver data to their customers. The tree-and-branch architecture of power distribution systems is perfect for Internet data transmission. In addition, it's now very economical to run optical fiber along long-distance transmission lines. Special optical cables are available that are either combined with transmission ground wires (the top wire on long-distance power lines), or wrap around the ground wire. Many utility companies have begun doing this in the past several years, and some have a lot of fiber already in place. Initially done for communication between substations, other users now rent out some of the fibers. If you install enough fibers, it could form a very significant communications structure. In fact, it's quite possible electric utility companies could challenge Telcos for all forms of communications business in just a few years-and win.\n\nTelco technology is not an efficient way of delivering digital communications; it's built around large, expensive central switches. Remember, networks are routed rather than switched. In other words, each piece of data contains its own destination address and routes toward its final destination at several points during its travels. The Telco network is slow, expensive, and smart. The routed network is fast, cheap, and stupid. The necessary intelligence is not in the network; it's attached to each end of the network. Fast and cheap is better than slow and expensive. And distributed intelligence is better than centralized intelligence.\n\nWhat does the future hold? How all of this actually plays out over the next decade will be fascinating. At some point, political demagoguery will inevitably come into play: \&quot;The communications infrastructure is a national asset-we can't allow it to be turned over to people who are interested only in profits,\&quot; or \&quot;Preserve it for the children,\&quot; etc. There will probably even be several personal and financial battles. The forces of regulation and control cannot hold out indefinitely. But, they won't go without a fight. So, stay tuned.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://ecmweb.com/print/cee-news-archive/breaching-digital-bottleneck&quot;},&quot;warcinfo&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;robots: classic\r\nhostname: ip-10-183-142-35.ec2.internal\r\nsoftware: Nutch 1.6 (CC)/CC WarcExport 1.0\r\nisPartOf: CC-MAIN-2014-10\r\noperator: CommonCrawl Admin\r\ndescription: Wide crawl of the web with URLs provided by Blekko for March 2014\r\npublisher: CommonCrawl\r\nformat: WARC File Format 1.0\r\nconformsTo: http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf&quot;},&quot;fasttext_openhermes_reddit_eli5_vs_rw_v2_bigram_200k_train_prob&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.3918318748474121,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.391832&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;error&quot;:&quot;Job manager crashed while running this job (missing heartbeats).&quot;,&quot;error_code&quot;:&quot;JobManagerCrashedError&quot;}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODc2NSwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL21sZm91bmRhdGlvbnMvZGNsbS1iYXNlbGluZS0xLjAiLCJleHAiOjE3NDI5MjIzNjUsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHVnZ2luZ2ZhY2UuY28ifQ.K1nHwr4VZRA0hyuxsY0nJGL8006ld-25D1OPBhDCuDD2qnu4BMLkylDpgTQdPFmX9DIwYPXc3kUzPGb0Xm81Bg&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/908e9d61fe22f6717c1a5fe5cc85e127?d=retro&amp;size=100&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;ML Foundations&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;mlfoundations&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:109},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path d="M6 9.75828C4.86056 9.75828 3.81948 9.45144 2.87678 8.83776C1.93407 8.22373 1.22089 7.39474 0.737243 6.35077C0.712651 6.30901 0.696256 6.25673 0.688059 6.19393C0.679861 6.13146 0.675763 6.06681 0.675763 6C0.675763 5.93319 0.679861 5.86838 0.688059 5.80557C0.696256 5.7431 0.712651 5.69098 0.737243 5.64923C1.22089 4.60526 1.93407 3.77643 2.87678 3.16274C3.81948 2.54872 4.86056 2.24171 6 2.24171C7.13944 2.24171 8.18052 2.54872 9.12323 3.16274C10.0659 3.77643 10.7791 4.60526 11.2628 5.64923C11.2873 5.69098 11.3037 5.7431 11.3119 5.80557C11.3201 5.86838 11.3242 5.93319 11.3242 6C11.3242 6.06681 11.3201 6.13146 11.3119 6.19393C11.3037 6.25673 11.2873 6.30901 11.2628 6.35077C10.7791 7.39474 10.0659 8.22373 9.12323 8.83776C8.18052 9.45144 7.13944 9.75828 6 9.75828ZM6 8.75608C6.92631 8.75608 7.77688 8.50753 8.5517 8.01043C9.32619 7.51367 9.91838 6.84353 10.3282 6C9.91838 5.15647 9.32619 4.48616 8.5517 3.98907C7.77688 3.4923 6.92631 3.24392 6 3.24392C5.07369 3.24392 4.22312 3.4923 3.4483 3.98907C2.67381 4.48616 2.08162 5.15647 1.67175 6C2.08162 6.84353 2.67381 7.51367 3.4483 8.01043C4.22312 8.50753 5.07369 8.75608 6 8.75608Z" fill="currentColor"></path><path d="M7.80933 5.92992C7.80933 6.51092 7.53544 7.02796 7.10973 7.35894C6.80337 7.59714 6.41838 6.98403 6.00027 6.98403C5.58215 6.98403 5.19716 7.59714 4.8908 7.35894C4.46509 7.02796 4.1912 6.51092 4.1912 5.92992C4.1912 4.9308 5.00115 4.12086 6.00027 4.12086C6.99939 4.12086 7.80933 4.9308 7.80933 5.92992Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>

Here what happened with me today. TimeMachine asked me whether I want to set a backup disk, I've answered yes, but then, when I've realized that in order to backup anything TimeMachine will clean the disk, I've changed my mind and canceled everything. And my disk suddenly became read only.

What I've tried before Googling:

$ sudo chflags -R nouchg Elements/
$ sudo chmod -R a+w Elements/

But I've failed with both of this, getting "read-only file system" messages.

What I've tried after Googling:

  1. Open Disk Utilities
  2. Click Repair Disk Permissions

But this button is disabled, and I have no idea what exactly should be done to enable it.

I have been using this disk for a quite a long time, and never had any permission issues with it. (Disk is formatted as NTFS, if that helps. Capacity is 2TB, of which 1.92TB are available.)

I'd really appreciate if someone will give me a hint how this can be resolved.

Try booting from the Recovery HD and see if the button is still disabled. –  rien333 Oct 7 '12 at 14:07
What exactly is it you need to do with the stuff on the NTFS disk? –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 15:26
@SamuelE.Giddins I need to work with disk just as I've worked yesterday, 2 days ago, 3 days ago etc. It looks like very annoying bug to me - to find out that out of a sudden this disk is considered to be read-only. –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 15:34
do you have any add-ons that would deal with file systems? if not, and you need to be able to write to an NTFS formatted disk, check out my revised answer. Otherwise, the disk has always been read-only, there is no built-in NTFS write support in OS X. –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 15:36

You are getting the read-only file system error because on OS X NTFS is natively read-only. It was read-only before your Time Machine run in, and will stay that way unless you install a third-party driver, such as Tuxera NTFS.

Disk Utility's built-in repair commands are merely a GUI front-end for fsck and fsck_hfs. They are not meant to be used on an NTFS-formatted disk.

thank you for this response, but if they are not meant for NTFS-formatted disks, then, what should I do? –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 15:15
Do you have a Windows install handy? –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 15:16
nope, I haven't ( –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 15:18
This is great mystery why I've used to write to this disk previously, but it looks like you are absolutely right, NTFS is not fully supported on MacOS. Your answer gave me a hint, so I believe it should be accepted. –  shabunc Oct 7 '12 at 16:46
thanks. i wish you luck –  segiddins Oct 7 '12 at 19:43

Kicking Out the Jams

The Trials and Triumphs of Barney Rosset's Grove Press


These same conditions were to give rise in the spring of 1970 to a conflict that marked the end of Grove's decade of remarkable success. A dissident group of employees sought to unionize the company, and a disciplined cell of feminists demanded veto power over Grove's editorial policy. The machinists' union quickly signed up half a dozen editorial workers, all of whom Rosset promptly fired. The women had other goals, including 24-hour free child care, for all profits from books written by black authors to be "returned" to the black "community" and for all profits from erotic books to be used to establish a defense fund for prostitutes. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the feminists occupied the executive offices at Grove and mounted a press campaign that made network television news. Rosset refused to acquiesce in what he saw as censorship and had them forcibly removed by the police. He had sat on his own sword.

The union lost the vote among the employees, but the demands of the radicals remained morally divisive. How could a man who had been a Communist in his youth, one who held in contempt any social policy that interfered with the freedom of the artist or the individual, not accede to the values of the women's movement? The writers and film-makers who saw in Grove a haven for expression and experimentation became disaffected. Readers, 200,000 of whom bought Evergreen Review every month and who sought out new books from Grove simply because they were published by Grove, began to desert the company.

These events, coupled with declining revenues from the film division and the excessive cost of renovating a new office building, combined to jeopardize Grove's financial future. But, more important, by the early 1970s, Grove's captive audience had been fractured. Books and magazine articles that only Grove would have published a scant five years earlier were now seen as safe commercial ventures by larger, more conventional houses, and Grove, at a moment of capital scarcity, was forced to compete with publishers who had far more money available to invest.

When I joined Grove in 1969, the company employed 140 people and had just moved into a lavishly restored office building at the corner of Bleecker and Mercer streets. Four years later, there were 14 of us working out of Rosset's home on West Houston Street, after an interim stopover on East 11th Street in a small building that housed a miniature movie theater and the Black Cat bar, which Rosset operated on the financially dubious policy of never charging friends or employees for their drinks.

During the 1970s, Grove lived on the income generated by its marvelous backlist. There was the occasional new book of note, even the rare momentary best-seller. But the halcyon days were gone, along with the money. Rosset's instinct had been to make Grove into what we would now call a multimedia company. And instinct it was, as his view of the future was always a bit light on planning or details and, later, on resources. He wanted a company that could publish a magazine to support its books and discover new writers, to run a book club that offered publications and short films (most of them in aggressive violation of just about everybody's "community standards") via the mail, so as to circumvent the regular, stodgy channels of distribution. He entered the feature film business to distribute movies such as Jean-Luc Godard's "Weekend" and the seminal, if banal, "I Am Curious (Yellow)." These and other films were, Rosset understood, a natural extension of the publishing operation (a number of them were made by Grove authors such as Marguerite Duras).

His idea of what America's future could aspire to--racial tolerance, free sexual expression--was based on morality and an acute sense of history. That some of his ideas were not much more than mental curlicues and that some of his behavior was awfully self-centered does not detract from his ethical impulse.

America has traveled some distance since the mid-1950s. Today it looks a lot more like what Rosset wanted it to be than it resembles the social order championed by those who would have delighted in attending his auto-da-fe. For his view of the future was not a "vision"; it was concrete, something one could stake reputation and private fortune on, which is what he did.

An inveterate child of the 1930s, he was a man whose true thoughts and emotions were closer to those of a precocious 16-year-old than to those of the charming sophisticate one first met. Rosset needed money but disdained what he believed it represented, as when, after his father's death, he sued the state of Illinois to return a prized charter to operate a private bank.

High turnover reported among charter school teachers

With so many charter school teachers moving on each year, concerns arise about retaining quality educators and how stability affects student performance.

July 25, 2011|By Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times

Kavita Papneja, a math teacher, joined an Alliance College-Ready charter several years ago and doesn't regret it. In her prior work at a traditional school, Gompers Middle School near Watts, "you have more behavior issues," she said. "Here, most of the time, we just have to worry about what we are teaching and what kids are learning."

As far as the charter workload, "if I have to spend extra hours, I will," said Papneja, 43, who believes she's the oldest teacher in her school. "It's not like they force me."

She and history teacher Stephanie McIlroy, who joined Alliance at age 21, also left a charter school; but in their case, the purpose was to follow Principal Howard Lappin from one Alliance charter school to a newly opened charter, the Alliance Environmental Science and Technology High School in Glassell Park.

Some former teachers at Alliance schools and elsewhere were less enthusiastic, speaking of pressure to produce high test scores and arbitrary management.

"We got in trouble for taking our sick days and personal days," said a history teacher who entered the teaching profession at a charter while in her 20s. She requested anonymity because she recently accepted a position at a different charter school. "Teachers feel so beleaguered because everything is presented to us as a problem we have to solve. But we can't fix all those problems, like when a kid misses 60 days in a semester."

Despite her former school's solid test scores, she said, the teacher departures matter.

"It has a huge effect on student morale," she said, especially for students who lack needed stability in other parts of their lives. "By the time students graduated from my school, there was not a single teacher who had been there the whole time."

I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Netbook. I had to use a flash key and during the installation i tried putting Ubuntu on a separate partition, but it kept showing a no root file system is defined error.

I didn't really know what i could do to fix it, so i decided to install it alongside Windows. I have a windows7 installation, which works perfectly fine. So the installation goes through perfectly and i give both OS's 40 Gigs of space. The comp restarts and NOTHING!

The computer boots directly into Windows. During the install it said i am supposed to be prompted at boot, and nothing happened. Ubuntu partitioned the C: drive, but this partition doesn't show up in Windows. If i boot using the flash drive, it shows the partition with the Ubuntu installation. I tried reinstalling, but now i don't get the prompt to asking me to install Ubuntu.

Really confused ..

It sounds like you have two disk drives and the boot loader was installed to the wrong drive. Either tell your BIOS to boot from the other drive, or reinstall, and make sure you direct grub to the correct drive.

to put it simply, the graphic driver loads slower than the rest of the system. I fixed it with these directions.

Get your precious Plymouth splash screen back

I didn't not follow the directions from this particular website, I couldn't find the one I used but these are the correct direction. I have mine back and can now remove the "quiet splash" and see the boot messages if needed.

Edit: while there is an detailed explanation of why you might want to check out, I and going to copy and paste the instructions below in case the link expires.

Open a virtual terminal and type the following command:

sudo gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash

This file may not exist, so you may be creating it from scratch now.

Enter the following content on the file you opened on the previous step:


Close and save the file.

Now, run the following command to commit the change:

sudo update-initramfs -u

Reboot and enjoy your Plymouth splash screen.

So i will need my gpu because mine isent working atm –  winter4w Jun 13 '12 at 2:50
I'm not sure what you are asking here. The fix has nothing to do with which gpu you have. If you can get to the log in screen your gpu is working. The reason that you have no splash screen is that the new kernels load so fast that the DRIVERS load after the rest of the system. This fix will get the system to wait for the graphic driver to load, hence allowing you to see the boot screen or any boot messages if you Esc. the splash screen. The system will boot slightly slower with this fix but if you have a fairly new system you will not notice the difference. –  TrailRider Jun 13 '12 at 21:39
Unless I misunderstood your initial question. after you installed you didn't see the boot screen but went to the log-in screen, you were able to log in and run Ubuntu correct?? If so then Ubuntu is installed and you can use this fix to get the boot screen to show again. –  TrailRider Jun 13 '12 at 21:48
Yes i dont see the boot screen but I am able to go on the login screen i was just wondering if I can get the boot screen –  winter4w Jun 14 '12 at 3:57
Then this should work for you. –  TrailRider Jun 14 '12 at 22:48

I have used ubuntu for almost 6 months full time at home while using windows for almost 6 years,so I previously used ubuntu on separate hard drive while I have one attached hard drive with partitions having NTFS file system so I used data from those partitions also. Now I want to again shift to ubuntu as I am a web developer and want to use ubuntu and I have a hp probook. So I just want to know few things:

Should I use wubi? But I have heard it is on windows installtion mercy still that is not good. Should I use dual boot and configure it separately without any wubi e.t.c.? Or should I install separate ubuntu on whole hard disk?

It seems like 3rd option is good but main concern in that case is that how will my data be safe? Like if my ubuntu is corrupted or need to install again or uninstall in any case, then I will need to format whole disk and all my data will be deleted as it is on unpartitioned space. So this seems to be unsafe. Actually I am not sure, but another option I have is to have some partitions and some unpartitioned space and install ubuntu on unpartitioned space and if I will remove ubuntu at some time or it will be removed some how then I will have my data safe in partitioned space. The way I am thinking really make sense? I have been actually windows user so may be thinking in that way, and want to know that how mostly people use ubuntu while feeling safe about their data. What is best way to use ubuntu?

Please tell whatever you know so that I can understand the way better. thanks

I would definitely recommend the third choice.

Like you said, the first choice is bad since you're basically running within Windows. The second choice is alright, but if you can run Ubuntu on a separate HDD that would be best in my opinion.

If Ubuntu gets corrupted, there's no need for you to format the drive or partitions before recovering your data. If you're going to be running Windows as well, you can access the Linux partitions, granted that you don't encrypt them (if you do I'm sure you still can I just don't know how)

WIndows 7 can natively read Ext2, 3 and 4. If you're using an earlier version of Windows you can download and use ext2fsd to view the linux partitions.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on 2 of my desktops PC's. I have not installed any addon packages or anything related to network. Please guide my on how to set up a LAN between these two machines. is there any GUI program to do this instead of Terminal? Because I am completely new to linux and am not very familiar with Terminal usage. I have the ethernet cable connected to a router which inturn is connected to my DSL modem to provide internet access to both my pc's.

Thanking you

Ok, first things first: is internet working for both? Can both browse webpages, etc? Is your only issue on how to share folders and/or printers with each other? –  MestreLion May 29 '11 at 10:38
What exactly do you want to use the LAN for? What you described already places the computers in a LAN. –  Oxwivi May 29 '11 at 11:48
Your router may also be set up to not let the machines talk to each other. Usually that's only with wireless, but make sure the machines are able to ping each other. You can do that from the System -> Administration -> Network Tools menu. –  Broam Jun 14 '11 at 20:27

If both are directly connected to the router and can access internet, then they already are in LAN. Maybe you want to share files and folders, right?

If so, its easy: right-click any folder you want to share, go to "Sharing Options", check the "Share this folder" box, choose a share name, and youre basically done.

If Samba support is not already installed by default, Ubuntu will offer you to install it on-the-fly. Just accept it. Oh, by the way: "Samba" is what enables Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) to share folders and files in a LAN, using the same protocol used by Windows. Meaning any folders you share will also be accessible by Windows machines in your LAN (if there is any)

Thank you for the help. Does both the computers need to have samba installed? like comp1 shares file to comp2, i do your suggestion in comp1, do i have to perform the same on comp2 just to access comp1's files? Note: comp2 need not share files to comp1. –  newforubuntulinux Jun 21 '11 at 11:55
@newforubuntulinux: Youre welcome. If comp2 will only access comp1's shared files, then no, no further setup is necessary. In File Manager (Nautilus is the proper name) just click Network in the left panel and browse till comp1's files. –  MestreLion Jun 22 '11 at 15:05

I'm a little unsure how far you want the guide to go. But if you simply want Internet connection / local file sharing:

With the computer you are connecting to your router:

Click on your network indicator (top right of your screen...) and select 'Edit Connections'. In the wired tab hit the button 'Add'. Give the connection a helpful name, and under the 'IPv4 Settings' tab choose "Shared to other computers" in the drop down 'Method' box. Save the chances and close the connection editor. Connected this computer to the Internet.

Connected up the second machine. On the first 'internet'ed' machine just make sure (using the network indicator) that the Wired Connection you've just created is chosen.

This GUI method should be able to cope with most more-complex setups too.

As I have understood, both computers are directly connected to the router. So no need to share the wired connection, as they are probaly already "internet'ed" by the router. I think this is only a matter of SaMBa-sharing folders. –  MestreLion May 29 '11 at 10:42
indeed - i think a little bit of confirmation is needed @newforubuntulinux please... –  thomas michael wallace May 29 '11 at 10:50
Yes both Computers are able to browse internet web pages. I want to share folders between the 2 machines. Thanks everyone for the effort to answer my question. –  newforubuntulinux May 30 '11 at 7:52
@newforubuntulinux: if any of the answers solved your issue, please choose one as the accepted answer. If not, feel free to edit your question and add more information on why they didnt work, and we well be pleased to help you further. –  MestreLion Jun 2 '11 at 7:06

I am attempting to filter every notification through espeak. However, I can't seem to find a way to get the notification body from a python script, or even what signal_name to listen to.


Trying to google for this only seems to yield results involving creating new notifications, so I am completely lost now.

Anyone can help me with this?

In short, what I want is to listen for incoming notifications using python, and obtaining the "body" attribute of the notification.

share|improve this question
It seems a notification doesn't produce a signal i.e., dbus-monitor "type='signal',interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'" shows nothing but dbus-monitor "interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'" shows notifications (type is 'method_call' not 'signal'). –  J.F. Sebastian Sep 7 '12 at 21:34

By notifications you mean the "OSD bubbles" that some software sends, like changing volume, IM chat, etc? You want to create a python program to capture those?

Well, Ask Ubuntu is not a programmer's QA, and software development is a bit beyond the scope, but here is a little code I did do capture notification bubbles:

import glib
import dbus
from dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop

def notifications(bus, message):
    if message.get_member() == "Notify":
        print [arg for arg in message.get_args_list()]


bus = dbus.SessionBus()

mainloop = glib.MainLoop()

Leave this running in a terminal, then open another terminal window and test it:

notify-send --icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png "My Title" "Some text body"

And the program will output this:

[dbus.String(u'notify-send'), dbus.UInt32(0L), dbus.String(u'/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png'), dbus.String(u'My Title'), dbus.String(u'Some text body'),...

As you may have guessed, message.get_args_list()[0] is the sender, [2] for icon, [3] for summary and [4] for body text.

For the meaning of the other fields, check the official specification docs

Why Would LeBron James Ever Want To Come to New Jersey?
Jim McIsaac/Getty Images

Looking at LeBron James' free agency options, why the heck would he want to come to Jersey?

For one, the team just got out of their arena that existed on a swamp, which basically describes what people think of when they think of New Jersey (unfairly so).

The Nets won 12 games in 2009-2010. If it were me, the Nets' situation wouldn't seem very appealing, and that's coming from a Nets fan.

But here's the thing that's keeping the New Jersey Nets in the hunt—mystique.

The Nets have a new Russian owner, music mogul Jay-Z, and two great players in Devin Harris and Brook Lopez. On top of that, they just drafted Derrick Favors and Damion James.

Doesn't sound like a 12-win team, does it?

Plus, the Nets are moving to Newark this season (not that Newark's all that enticing), but the Nets have the aura of Brooklyn in the future.

LeBron won't have to wait long until he gets to Brooklyn, which is just as good as Manhattan in certain ways.

Sure, he could go to L.A. and play for the Clippers, but I think the Clips may be the one team whose name rings a more sour bell than the Nets.

And barring a shocking move, I doubt he'll stay in Cleveland.

Yes, he could go to Chicago, Dallas, or Miami and party it up, but those cities aren't New York.

And as for the Knicks, who do play in New York, their core somehow manages to be worse off than that of the 12-win Nets.

With all of that being said, I still think it would be a wild card if LeBron landed with the Nets.

But it could happen. Is it a long shot? Yes. But is it possible? Definitely.

Who knows, maybe LeBron will surprise us and take a bite out of the Big Apple...I mean New Jersey.

Dont Overlook Smaller College Football Programs!

Year after year, in every aspect of the game, smaller football programs are often overlooked.

Memories of a great Boise State team walking all over a highly ranked Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, Larry Fitzgerald (PITT) losing the 2003 Heisman race to Jason White (OKLA) supposedly based on team record not player performance as the Heisman should be.

Not to take away from White who was a great player, but he finished ranked 8th in passing yards, 26th in completion percentage, and 8th in QB rating.

Fitzgerald, on the other hand, finished first in almost every receiving category, but since his school was a lower profile (and ranked lower) many voters chose White instead, Basing there votes on team performance instead of individual stats.

If the Heisman was based on team performance then every year, the National Champions should pick one of there players to win it since they are the best team it would only be fair. Now how dumb does that sound?

Again this year, a small school player is setting the precedent nine games into the year, but still Jarrett Dillard of Rice is still never mentioned in the run for Heisman, although he is far ahead of leading receiver candidate Michael Crabtree of Texas Tech. Oh and by the way he has less receptions but still WAY better numbers than Crabtree.

Ever since the BCS was implemented, Strength of Schedule has become one of the biggest things in determining a team's grit and power.

I think this has contributed to the brainwashing of those voting on awards and polls. A small team like Ball State does not have the recruiting power of teams like Alabama, Penn State, USC, Ohio State, and Florida.

I think if you are going to incorporate Strength of Schedule into the Heisman equation then you should also calculate Strength of Recruitment!

If this were the case, we would find out that the small schools and players we are overlooking, if put on a level playing would probably walk all over 50 percent of the teams in the top 25!

People do not realize that Nick Saban, one of the best college coaches of the last 2 decades, came from a very small Toledo school, but as soon as he was given the chance to move up, he was an instant success at Michigan State, LSU, and now Alabama.

My point to this is, the coaches and kids who put up big numbers at small schools would still put up the big numbers if they were given a chance to play at a bigger school.

Most of your LaDainian Tomlinsons (TCU '97-'00) go to smaller colleges and Junior Colleges because of grade requirements or to stay closer to home. A kid that wants or in most cases NEEDS to stay close to home should not be punished for this decision.

I understand that you must incorporate Strength of schedule into the polls in order to determine which team is the strongest in the nation. My only concern is that this is going to continue to spew over into individual awards like the Heisman.

If this continues to be the case college sports, is going to be so predictable that all your team's best player would have to do to win the Heisman is lead his team to the national championship or at least the top 3 in the final standings.

What if Graham Harrell had lost to Texas and then later in the year loses to Oklahoma knocking Tech to No. 14 or 15 in the BCS polls? Does this mean he would be any less worthy than Colt McCoy if Texas were to win the Championship, but McCoy ends up with way less in every offensive category than Harrell?

Would this be right just because Harrell would have two team losses to McCoy's 0? I don't think it would be, and if it is not right for a high-profile team such as Texas Tech, then it should not be right for a smaller school!

Your comments are appreciate.

    The purpose of taxpayer supported “public health” is to prevent the spread of diseases that can be communicated without contact with the infected individual. The author and apparently the entire ‘public health’ special interest group is trying to convert ‘public health’ into whatever activity it thinks is a ‘good idea’ and it can bring within the scope of its bureaucracy. It is notable the ‘public health’ bureaucrats are identifying such non diseases as motor vehicle safety. This is another example of jurisdiction creep.

  2. DDD says:

    Very eloquently stated. Should meet the approval of your liberal following.

  3. bigmoney says:

    I agree 100%. Family planning is good public policy that has the added bonus of saving taxpayers’ money and giving people a choice and resources to plan their families. It’s a shame that it has become a political issue.

  4. Mark says:

    too bad you are located in Texas, where women’s health doesn’t count at public health.

  5. Nancy Ford says:

    I had forgotten that Title X which provided women with access to low cost contraceptives was signed into law by Richard Nixon. Clearly, family planning is something that makes sense to the majority of Americans and as such bridges political party divides–unless of course it is being used by the fringe elements as a weapon. I also appreciated the author’s “reality check”–contraception, family planning, is something we had debated and accepted decades ago. The fact that current research deals with emerging nations and not our own advanced society is a wake up call. Why is anyone doubting the benefits of family planning in 2012?

  6. Emily says:

    Eloquent and on the mark. Bravo, Elena Marks.

  7. Kimberly says:

    I couldn’t agree more. We spend so much time on international development and not enough time on the issues in our own backyard. Family planning is an important public policy. Contraceptives should be available and provided at a low cost to anyone who so chooses to use them. Every woman should have the right to choose how and when to plan for a family.

  8. Patricia Snyder says:

    Why is it these days that when people disagree, they label one another, closing the door to honest debate to help find the common ground? I personally believe that America dealt with this issue decades ago, but still have a lot to do to continue to keep our common public, healthy. And for me that means making contraceptives and education about contraceptives available for as many people as possible…

  9. Karen1961 says:

    The health benefits of family planning and widely available contraceptives are unquestioned in the scientific and health policy literature, as are the health benefits of many other public health tools cited by the author. We need to use the best tools available to us to achieve healthy babies, women and families.

  10. Brian says:

    I agree that it is good for a married couple to plan their family. However, if someone doesn’t want to pay for abortion or contraception for moral reasons, they shouldn’t be forced to.

    Contraceptives have lead to higher divorce rate, higher rate of STD’s, and unplanned pregnancies are still an alarming high number.

    Why don’t the statistics support your statements to show that we are reaping the benefits of contraceptives? Oh right, because they aren’t true.

    It’s a much more complicated problem that just giving everyone a pill.

  11. georgex says:

    The directive from the Bible to populate the “four corners” of the earth has been fulfilled. Advocating that birth control should not be used puts the sustainability of the planet in jeopardy, families with more children than they can afford and spread of diseases that cause much misery and death. That is an immoral position.</span></div></div>

Could an Islamic sitcom be a hit in America?


Throughout the history of television, there have been several TV shows in which the original concept of the show – a comedy about being a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, for example – might seem, on the top, a bit uncomfortable.

So how is it that one of Canada’s most popular homegrown television shows is a gentle situation comedy about the Islamic community in a small Saskatchewan town?

Welcome to “Little Mosque on the Prairie.”  It’s a half-hour sitcom on the CBC, about several members of the Muslim community of Mercy, Saskatchewan and how they share a house of worship with the local Anglican church.

In fact, take a look at the premiere episode of “Little Mosque on the Prairie” and judge for yourself.  It’s in two parts, as listed below.

A few things to consider.  Since its premiere in 2007, “Little Mosque on the Prairie” has been one of the biggest homegrown hits in Canada, even surpassing the venerable show “Corner Gas.”  It’s been syndicated around the world.

But despite all this success, the show has never broken through to the United States.  Plans to bring the show in, or to create an American version of the show, have both stalled.

So here’s what I want to know from you.  Watch the clips in this blog and you tell me -

1. Would you watch “Little Mosque on the Prairie” if it aired in America?  Why or why not?

2. Do you think America is ready for a sitcom involving Islamic characters and culture?  Why or why not?

Okay – discuss.

Of course your teacher doesn't go over homework. That makes sense.

I say no.

Case in point: My oldest and I went around in circles yesterday about studying for a math test. She argued she couldn’t begin studying until her class finished the unit because she “wouldn’t know what to study.” I suggested she start with finished and corrected homework, which seemed like a logical approach. She spent the next 10 minutes telling me why that couldn’t happen, which seemed nonsensical.

Here’s the conversation:

Me: Do you have a math test coming up?

Her: When we finish the unit.

Me: When is that?

Her: If we finish the unit Friday, the test will be Monday. If we finish Monday, it will be Tuesday.

Me: Maybe you can study a little each night between now and then.

Her: No, I can’t until we finish the unit.

Me: What?

Her: I won’t know what to study.

Me: You’re doing homework every night. Presumably, that is the material that will be on the test.

Her: I don’t want to study it if I’m doing it wrong.

Me: Doesn’t your teacher grade it?

Her: No, he just marks whether you’ve done it.

Me: Really? He doesn’t go over the homework? I need to know because I think maybe I need to talk to him then.

Her: He only goes over the ones you did wrong.

Me: Is there something you can go over, practice each night?

Her: No, I have to wait until the unit is done and do the review homework.

Me: (imagine, if you will, my raised voice) OK, Use whatever study method you want. If you bring home a C, the cellphone is gone.

    Good answer! I say you won the argument.

  2. kvp says:

    If you figure out how to stop the procrastination please, please please tell me how… I’ll pay you… a lot…

  3. ChristineV says:

    Ha! This reminds me of a conversation I had with our son while driving home from soccer last week. He and his Dad had come to blows over computer use and bedtime the night before.
    Me: when I say 10:30 bedtime it doesn’t mean coming upstairs and getting ready at 10:30
    He: that’s lame
    Me: you need to be off the computer 1 hour before bedtime
    He: owww, why? That’s lame (stupid, dumb – insert word here)
    It wasn’t quite that bad, but you get the picture. We had a calm, quiet discussion and in the end I said “we have to agree to disagree. I can see my side and yours, as can you, but on this we are not going to agree”. But I won since the parents’ rules win. :)

  4. lizzee says:

    Oh,so have been there! Wish it was over when they hit a certain age but find those talks are still common with my married daughter and myself. Moms must talk in tongues to our children’s ears. And the best retort they give is’You just don’t know!”

  5. KTT says:

    When I was in high school, and even college, I had such a hard time studying for math tests! I could study for anything else and do well, but I had no clue how to approach studying numbers, it just didn’t make sense to me. I used to do well in math until I got to high school and I actually had to study. Since I didn’t know what or how to study, I fell behind. I would talk to her teacher anyway and ask if she/he can give you tips on studying at night. Maybe they have notes they take or some extra problems to solve.

  6. Naomi Seldin says:

    I’m having flashbacks to when I was in high school, Tracy. My father was a lawyer — he argued for a living. Can you imagine trying to win a case against that?

  7. Tracy Ormsbee says:

    @Naomi: I should change my headline to ask, Can you win an argument with a teenager without a law degree. :)

  8. maggie says:

    @Naomi – more importantly, does he give lessons?

  9. john says:

    You cant win an argument with a woman. Why do you think you could with a teenager? Why do you suppose dads leave it up to moms?</span></div></div>

Researchers at Harvard Medical School took a break from studying lobster fighting and shifted their focus to fruit fly fights, and even mutant fruit fly fights.

(Via The Annals of Improbable Research.)

Fruit flies are strange creatures. Or perhaps it's that fruit fly researchers are strange creatures.

One of my cousins was a fruit fly researcher. She took fruit fly testicles and squashed them and then studied them under a microscope, looking for... something... I forget. I think just finding the fruit fly testicles in the first place was accomplishment enough.

Fruit fly researchers like to give their discoveries strange names. Typically, a gene is named after what results when you disable it. For example, a gene without which fruit flies die in two days is named Kenny, after the South Park character.

My favorite: The gene without which fruit flies get drunk really easily is called cheap date. (That last page has several more funny gene names.)

Yes, that's right. Fruit flies get drunk. There's a fruit fly drunk-o-meter, though I forget how it works. But one amusing aspect of fruit fly drunkenness is that just before they finally pass out, there's a big burst of activity.

Strange gene naming has spread beyond the fruit fly world. There is a human gene named sonic hedgehog after the Sega video game character. (It's related to the fruit fly gene "hedgehog", so named because disabling it causes the fly to develop into a ball with spikes.)</span></div></div>

We do not have a sequencer for NT 4.0. So basically you cannot sequence your application from NT 4.0 directly and put them straight into your Windows XP SoftGrid environment!


So if that's the case, how do I get my application from NT 4.0 to Sequenced Virtual Application and then deployed? Well, I hate to say it but there is no easy route! The main thing to understand is getting a process behind you to bring your application up to a specific level and then sequenced on a supportable platform such as Windows XP.

Application Compatability 

Application Migration Process from NT 4.0 (High Level)

The above show this process around taking an old NT 4.0 application and passing it through the application compatibility toolkit. Now I am not saying this is the be all and end all but it certainly can be used as a good guide, or flow process you can leverage off!

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) enables software developers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and IT professionals who work in a corporate environment to determine, before rolling out within the organization, whether their applications are compatible with a new version of the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. ACT also enables such individuals to determine how an update to the new version will impact their applications.
You can use the ACT features to:


You can download it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=24DA89E9-B581-47B0-B45E-492DD6DA2971&amp;displaylang=en 

Once your application is to a stable state you can look to run through the sequencing wizards as per normal and capture your application.


The core benefit is that you are just trying to get this one suite of applications working! Not regression testing it against many others 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, etc etc application along side it.

This can help save you and your business valuable time and stop massive amounts of pain with your upgrades from NT 4.0 to XP/Vista! We know that there are many companies still going through these migrations, and in my humble opinion I hope that this helps you migrate more dynamically from these older legacy platforms. (Good luck to the lads up North! You know who you are :-) )</span></div></div>

As they keep interest rates near historic lows, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and other U.S. officials are a borrower’s best friend. But for retirees and other income-oriented investors, the super-low rates are a financial nightmare.

Portfolio mainstays such as U.S. Treasury bonds and investment-grade corporate and municipal debt just aren’t producing enough income. That has prompted—or forced—many income investors to look farther afield.</span></div></div>

Foolferlove: "I'd like to take a loan out at the first bank of Lorenzo too. 4 percent sounds real good to me! Where should I send the application?


Actually, I do have a real question...Can I loan money to a family member and charge zero interest with an indefinite repayment period? Or is this kind of loan somehow a no-no since it can be used to get around gift taxes?"

IIRC, it can create phantom income for the lender (and potential gift tax issues if the loan is relatively large). My recollection is a bit hazy, but a believe that there is a de minimis exception for loan below a certain size (mayber 10k?); but in any event, if the loan is has a below market rate --- by reference to some applicable "federal funds" rate --- then the IRS will impute additional interest until the rate is at the "federal funds" rate the the lender needs to recognize phantom income (as if the interest were paid and then gifted).

For example (all numbers hypothetical) if Daddy Warbucks loans Warbucks Junior $800k at zero interest when the applicable rate should be 4%, then Daddy Warbucks is deemed to have 32k in phantom interest income (800k * [4% - 0% charged]) on which income tax is due and is also deemed to have made a gift of the 32k interest not collected, which is larger than the 11k annual exemption (or 22k if Daddy Warbucks is married), so a gift tax return would also be due, unless Warbucks, Jr. is married, too - because 32k less than 44k available from a married couple to another married couple.

One fo the resident pros will need to add the exact details and citation.

Regards, JAFO

Lester is stellar in first win of season

CHICAGO -- A week ago, there was panic and there was outrage in the land known as Red Sox Nation. Manager Bobby Valentine went to his bullpen with an eight-run lead against the Yankees on national television, only to witness an implosion of epic proportions.

In other words, it's amazing how much things have changed for a team that is suddenly among the hottest in baseball.

This time, Valentine went to his relief crew for the final six outs with the narrowest of margins.

And they came through, leading the streaking Red Sox to a 1-0 win over the White Sox on Saturday night.

Boston has won six in a row -- all six victories coming in the aftermath of that blown 9-1 lead against the Yankees last Saturday.

"That's what they're going to do all year," said Adrian Gonzalez, who had the only RBI in the game. "We know that. For the first couple of weeks, as the guys [struggled], especially on a team like this where everything gets overblown, overdrawn, you start pressing a little bit, trying harder. As the season goes and you get into the flow of things, you just stop thinking about that and do what you can. That's what these guys are doing."

For the first time this season, Valentine's team is at .500. This, after a 4-10 start.

The strong relief performances of Franklin Morales, Vicente Padilla and Alfredo Aceves gave ace Jon Lester his first win.

"They're coming together," Valentine said. "You play the season to build the little parts of your team. I think the bullpen is coming together pretty nicely. Even though it's been Padilla-Morales, tonight it was Morales-Padilla and they got through that [eighth] inning nicely. Alfredo finished it off. But the 1-0 game is the toughest game to go to the bullpen, we all know that, especially on the road. You don't win a lot of games 1-0 on the road."

It was Boston's first 1-0 win since a 16-inning thriller at Tampa Bay on July 17 of last season.

For Lester, it was his first victory since Sept. 6, 2011.

"Well, sometime, either last night or today, he asked what he had to do," Valentine said. "I just said, 'Pitch like an ace, like Jon Lester is', and he pitched like an ace. He had both sides of the plate. Two-seamer away, cutter in. Had a good changeup. Very competitive. He was terrific."

And he needed to be. Lester's opponent was Jake Peavy, who pitched a complete game, only to get the tough-luck loss.

"Those games are fun. It's just a battle," Lester said. "I've been on the other end of those. You feel like you do everything you can to put your team in position to win, and the other guy just does a little bit more or you don't get the timely hitting or whatever. That was big tonight, grinding it out. Our hitters did a great job. Defense played awesome tonight. Those are more or less fun. Every win is important for a pitcher."

The Red Sox have gone a full turn through the rotation with every pitcher earning a win.

"When Josh [Beckett] won his game, we said maybe we'll put a string together," Valentine said. "Now we have them all winning. That's how you start building a real foundation of a team. Those other little things are just parts of a team but foundation is what those starters can do day in and day out. They're pretty good. I'll take those five that we're running out there right now."

Lester went seven innings, allowing five hits and no runs while walking one and striking out seven. He threw 122 pitches, 78 for strikes.

Then there was Peavy, who gave up four hits and one run, walking one and striking out seven.

"The ball bounced their way tonight," Peavy said. "We did all we could do. Lester was mighty good."

When Peavy buckled ever so slightly in the fourth, the Red Sox made him pay.

Ryan Sweeney started it, blooping one into right and hustling out of the box for a double.

"I knew if he didn't catch it that I would have a chance," Sweeney said. "I was just going to try to make something happen."

With one out, Gonzalez fought off a 2-2 fastball against Peavy, his former teammate in San Diego, and punched it into right for the RBI single.

"Fastballs in," Gonzalez said. "We go to 2-2 with fastballs in and I had a feeling he was going to stay with a fastball in and I just told myself, 'Get on top.' If he makes a good pitch down, offspeed down, then you have to tip your hat. I wasn't going to let him go up top again."

Lester held it right there, and handed it off to the bullpen.

After Morales and Padilla navigated their way through the eighth, on came Aceves. He was magnificent, mowing through the White Sox 1-2-3 and ending the game by striking out A.J. Pierzynski on a changeup.

"He was great," Valentine said. "You know, we talked to him that he doesn't always have to throw it 97 [mph]. Tonight, he threw some very effective fastballs at 94, 93, and then had his 96, 97. He pitched. He got the final strikeout with a changeup. That's what you have to do."</span></div></div>

I read that Pope Benedict XVI is resigning. I don't know much about Catholic/papal authority as it relates to leading the Church, but as far as I can remember, a pope dies before another one takes the reigns. Apparently, this has happened before, but how does the living pope confer that authority to a successor, since he's still alive? Since he resigned, is his authority to lead the Catholic church removed from him, or how does that work?

Yes, as the Pope said in his resignation speech, he gives up the office and it is for those whose duty it is to convoke the conclave and elect a successor — just as it would be if he had died.

As a cardinal, he's entitled to attend the conclave (but he probably won't) but he can't vote because he's over eighty.

Additionally, his papal ring will be destroyed, just as if he had died. I forget the source, but the analogy of death while still breathing is wholly correct. –  Affable Geek Feb 13 '13 at 13:38
Yes, after he abdicates he has no say whatsoever in where authority passes thereafter. –  mxyzplk Feb 13 '13 at 22:24

Jimmy Akin stated on his blog:

Pope Benedict may follow the pattern of previously resigned popes and spend the rest of his days in a monastery. Alternately, he may live quietly with his brother. Either way, he will do his best to stay out of the public eye so as to give his successor the freest hand possible. (This is the same thing that usually happens when a U.S. president leaves office; it’s traditional for him to more-or-less vanish, at least for a time.)

The papal authority is removed completely from the ex-pope. From wikipedia, I understood that his ring, seal etc. are destroyed as though he died, though it's not clearly stated there.

As Andrew Leach wrote, as a cardinal the ex-pope can attend conclave, but even if he was younger than eighty, he would be expected not to be very active in the election of his successor (part of the tradition of vanishing from public).

EDIT: according to what I found while researching answer for a related question, there is an aspect of the pope's role he maintains after resignation, or even after death: the obligation and authority to pray for the Church.

Another EDIT: as Cardinal Lombardi said, Joseph Ratzinger won't participate in the conclave. In Czech version the Vatican Radio goes to more details, such as that Ratzinger will no longer be a Cardinal, but I didn't find it in English.

It's on Vatican Insider Because this is entirely new -- the circumstances are rather different from Gregory XII -- I rather think that no-one, including the Curia, knows precisely what the procedures and protocols are. –  Andrew Leach Feb 15 '13 at 8:13

How about making it clear that the Gaza Palestinian's hide the rocket launchers in schools, daycare centers, residential areas and places of worship? Israel is not indescriminate about these strikes.

This is the sort of thing that happens when launching missiles from neighborhoods. Hamas makes the most of playing the sympathy card while using human shields. Also CNN and the BBC were showing falsified video of 'victims' yesterday, one guy was seen being carried aloft by rescuers only to to be seen later leading a demonstration none the worse for wear. Another poor 'victim' stopped the act a bit too soon and jumped off the stretcher before the director had called "cut" it would seem. Yes there are innocent victims in wars, but they are very useful victims for Hamas sadly.

I think it's something that the US can have drones blast rebels and civilians and no one says much about it. But when Israeli rockets do the same thing, everyone gets up in arms. Hell, Israel has rockets being fired at it's people. What Nation on this earth would NOT fire back? Israel should tell the Government in Gasa that the first rocket that falls into any city and kills any people, the WAR will begin and Gasa will be totally taken over AND KEPT as Israeli land forever. NEVER to be given back. And if Egypt wants to join Hammus in the fighting, IT's territory will be kept too; NEVER to be given back. If they did that, Israel would be a LOT BIGGER NATION within a few years. And after those few years, Israel would be a lot safer because it's neighbors will realize they are going to lose ground and Israel will get bigger. There is NOT ONE OTHER COUNTRY that would allow rockets to be fired on itself without declaring war.

Well...if hidden in homes, pick another target...there have to be plenty. Children are children everywhere...precious. ProIsrael...but also a elsewhere!

jjollmanNov. 18, 1211:53 AM

I suggest that people read the full history of the conflict before commenting.

budgrant00Nov. 18, 1211:54 AM

d434478..Target elsewhere? How does that work exactly when the targeted missiles are where the targeted missiles are placed amongst homes and schools? That said, last time Israel did refrain from taking out Hamas leadership when they were using human shields and arriving unannounced to sleep in random civilian homes.

owatonnabillNov. 18, 1211:55 AM

The fact that these brave jehadists need to hide behind womens' skirts and childrens' schools and day care centers says a lot.

budgrant00Nov. 18, 1212:05 PM

As for missiles in question they were smuggled in from Iran. Two ways into Gaza, through Egypt via the official entry points or the tunnels Israel took out a couple years ago. The other way is on relief and supply ships which Israel gets grief over searching. So we have Hamas and Iran going to great lengths to arm Gaza and launch randomly on Israel, and people can't understand why Gaza gets hit? So what would any other nation do in Israel's place when faced with a terrorist group backed openly by a soon to be nuked up Iran? I'm not sure what the anti Israel folks here expect? The settlement program is about creating defensible borders. If Israel could be assured they would never again need to defend it's self that land would be turned over, but the reality is that it will never be the case.

If you don't assassinate elected leaders and crow about it, you don't get rockets shot at you. You don't get rockets shot at you, you don't have to bomb apartment buildings... We knew this for decades, and we know that blaming the Palestinian family for their children dying for their allowing armed militants on their roofs is only done by fools and cowards, done by sociopaths so sick fools can swallow it and nod as to how it is justified.. but then, you are what you do. Little cowards will always be little cowards.

stingballNov. 18, 12 1:33 PM

And here we go again with the media falling into the hands of the Hamas terrorists, blaming Israel for killing civilians instead of accurately pointing out how Hamas provoked Israel into a confrontation. And not mentioning how the Hamas terrorists typically hide amongst civilians populations to keep from being target. The correct blame belongs on the Hamas terrorists who cowardly commit terrorist acts and hide within civilian populations, directly putting innocent civilians at risk. Interesting how often the media cannot scratch just a little bit beneath the surface and see the real truth.

The Universe sends us light at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, most of this light does not reach us at ground level here on Earth. Why? Because we have an atmosphere which blocks out many types of radiation while letting other types through. Fortunately for life on Earth, our atmosphere blocks out harmful, high energy radiation like X-rays, gamma rays and most of the ultraviolet rays. It also block out most infrared radiation, as well as very low energy radio waves. On the other hand, our atmosphere lets visible light, most radio waves, and small wavelength ranges of infrared light through, allowing astronomers to view the Universe at these wavelengths.

Most of the infrared light coming to us from the Universe is absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. Only in a few narrow wavelength ranges, can infrared light make it through (at least partially) to a ground based infrared telescope.

The Earth's atmosphere causes another problem for infrared astronomers. The atmosphere itself radiates strongly in the infrared, often putting out more infrared light than the object in space being observed. This atmospheric infrared emission peaks at a wavelength of about 10 microns (micron is short for a micrometer or one millionth of a meter).

So the best view of the infrared universe, from ground based telescopes, are at infrared wavelengths which can pass through the Earth's atmosphere and at which the atmosphere is dim in the infrared. Ground based infrared observatories are usually placed near the summit of high, dry mountains to get above as much of the atmosphere as possible. Even so, most infrared wavelengths are completely absorbed by the atmosphere and never make it to the ground.

From the table below, you can see that only a few of the infrared "windows" have both high sky transparency and low sky emission. These infrared windows are mainly at infrared wavelengths below 4 microns.

Infrared Windows in the Atmosphere

Sky Transparency
Sky Brightness
1.1 - 1.4 microns
low at night
1.5 - 1.8 microns
very low
2.0 - 2.4 microns
very low
3.0 - 4.0 microns
3.0 - 3.5 microns: fair
3.5 - 4.0 microns: high
4.6 - 5.0 microns
7.5 - 14.5 microns
8 - 9 microns and 10 -12 microns: fair
others: low
very high
17 - 40 microns
17 - 25 microns: Q
28 - 40 microns: Z
very low
very high
330 - 370 microns
very low

Basically, everything we have learned about the Universe comes from studying the light or electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects in space. To get a complete picture of the Universe, we need to see it in all of its light, at all wavelengths. This is why it is so important to send observatories into space, to get above our atmosphere which prevents so much of this valuable information from reaching us.

Since most infrared light is blocked by our atmosphere, infrared astronomers have placed instruments onboard, rockets, balloons, aircraft and space telescopes to view regions of the infrared which are not detectable from the ground. As a result, amazing discoveries about our Universe have been made and hundreds of thousands of new astronomical sources have been detected for the first time.

Due to the rapid development of better infrared detectors and the ability to place telescopes in space, the future is extremely bright for infrared astronomy.

Ground based infrared observatories, using advanced techniques such as Adaptive Optics are providing fascinating views of the infrared Universe viewed through our atmosphere's infrared windows.

Mauna Kea Observatories
Although these observatories cannot view at other infrared wavelengths, they can observe the near-infrared sky almost anytime the weather permits, providing valuable long term studies of objects in space.

New missions are being planned to get above the atmosphere to observe the infrared Universe with better resolution than ever before. SOFIA, an airborne observatory, is schedule to start operations in 2004. The Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in August 2003, is NASA's next great observatory in space.

In the next decade, you will probably hear much news about discoveries being made in infrared astronomy, as we now can see beyond our atmosphere's infrared windows!

    You think the Boys would bring in Norv Turner as OC if he gets caned in SD?
    He would have this offense rolling and Tony playing a heck of alot better!! I think Jones would go for this. Heck, would even give him the title of assistant head coach.

    I've been wondering the same thing. Garrett and he are very tight, but Callahan is our OC here along with OL Coach, and Norv coming might upset that applecart. I personally would love to see it.

    I'm not convinced he's done in SD though.

    I hate to interrupt this private thread, but I believe Norv said SD was going to be his last coaching job when he took that position originally, didn't he? I can't see him being OC in Dallas, and I can't see us moving Callahan over. I think the Garrett/Callahan relationship seems to be working pretty well.

    If Norv was cut loose he might be willing to come in to consult, as a consultant he wouldn't have any formal coaching title. Didn't Capers do that a few years ago for the Pats?

    To answer truthfully, and not an extension of purely theoretical. Zero. First, he won't be leaving San Diego before the end of this season. And their team usually picks up about this part of the season anyways. So he should be good for one more season there.

    A head coach usually has his call as to who are his Coordinators. Jason Garrett chose this format and Jerry wouldn't pull the plug on Jason before a full three years as the head coach to begin with.

    I suspect that the 'consultant' gig mentioned by craig is the most likely scenario for Norv heading back Dallas-ways.

    I don't expect Dallas to go after Norv, they brought in a quality coach in Callahan as the OC.

    Sure, let's bring back another coach from the glory years...

    I am about as impressed with Norv as I am with Chan Gailey....

    You could make Callahan asst HC along with Robinson although that may be prohibited or make Robinson mad. You could make him passing coordinator and a big salary. Getting him here would be a plus but I'd rather have someone who could mix in the West Coast variant more or even some more Martz. Turner and Red are a good bit alike but there aren't many people who know enough to really answer that question with any authority.

    Jason needs to mix things up more using our RBs like Martz, our WRs more like Walsh, and use Hanna and Witten more like Jason Garrett. Use Witten underneath and intermediate some and use Hanna more like Gates. He needs to vary the tempo of the game more and even occasionally use the hurry up and no huddle offense.

Please no more travel deals Woot, they aren't real deals for the vast majority.


@wisenekt: Travelzoo usually has pretty good deals imo. May I ask why you feel they are not? Not flaming, just curious as I happen to love the site and was wondering if you had found better deals elsewhere. If so, share! :)


Does Woot post travel offers as a scapegoat for downvotes to protect the other offers?


3 nights is not a vacation. just saying.


@kerowyn: Travelzoo tends to be an ad-plagued dungeon of forcing-you-to-search-on-other-sites-through-them-so-they-get-commissions... uhhhh... -itude.

Nine times out of ten, the travel deals posted here have been thinly veiled timeshare scams, very restrictive on location (Fly to Honolulu for $49!* *Only if departing from Oahu. From LA, $1,099. DC, $35,983), or ad-plagued dungeons of see-above.

This one seems to be another of the third category with some of the first mixed in. The price listed is if leaving from Ft Lauderdale. For me in DC, it was about double the listed... if I even had the right package, it was hard to be sure.


@jai151 You are right on the money there!

I clicked on it, and couldn't even tell where the real deal was. Also I saw several times "Airfare estimated" So this doesn't really mean much for the money its advertising...


@solo154: I was so lost trying to navigate the site I got my order mixed up in my comment. I meant to say third with some of the second, didn't see any timeshare stuff there but plenty of misleading rates, including one listed with New York in the search box under but the rate was from Florida.


@jai151: I got a Bahamas all inclusive deal from them and it was fine as well as several local deals. Yeah, I had to fly to Ft. Lauderdale to make it worth it, but it was still a good deal. 400 bucks for a 3 day thing, and an extra 200 for my additional airfare from LA. No timeshare talks were even mentioned.

The whole point of their site is so you don't have to search for vacation deals yourself. I don't think they are particularly deceptive about restrictions or anything. It seems a little harsh to call it a dungeon.


I swear to goodness...if there is ever a vacation deal that y'all don't vote down into oblivion, I'm going to have to jump on it because it'll be a deal for real!!!</span></div></div>

So, if something tragic were to happen to you, who would pay those bills to the bank, the equipment manufacturer, and the chemical seed dealer? And, what would it take to settle those accounts in full?

The answer, according to one independent insurance agent, is as much a personal choice as it is a matter of finance.

While some industry experts advocate carrying life insurance policies equal to 10 or 15 times your annual income, Mike Anderson of Anderson Insurance in Indianola, Miss., said, "There is no particular formula to determine exactly how much life insurance you need."

In today’s environment, he said, owning a million dollars or more of life insurance is very common. But, to be truthful, it’s never really enough when something happens. You should base your level of coverage on your personal financial goals, which may include your children’s education or the desire to provide lifetime income security for your family.

"As a farmer, you should definitely choose a level of coverage that will, at the very minimum, cover your crop and equipment loans, so that if something happens to you mid-season, your family is protected and a fire sale is avoided," he said.

The first step in determining how much insurance is right for you, Anderson said, is to answer a few simple questions.

o Is someone, including your local lending official, requiring that you secure a set amount of life insurance in order to obtain a business loan?

o How much money does it realistically take you to farm each year?

o Are you married? How many children do you have?

o What are your concerns for your family if something were to happen to you? Do you want to guarantee your children’s education? Do you want to guarantee a lifetime income for your spouse?

o What is your greatest monetary concern if something happens to you?

Once you’ve taken the time to answer these questions and now know how much life insurance you want to purchase, the next step is determining what type of insurance best fits your individual goals.

Selecting a type of insurance, Anderson said, is based on three things: your budget, your comfort level for risk, and your desire to either rent or own your insurance.

"Do you want a return on your money or do you just want pure term insurance?" he asks. "Pure term will always be the most economical coverage available. However, the more expensive permanent coverage policies, including universal life, whole life and variable life, build equity."

"Each of the insurance products offers its own distinct advantages and disadvantages," Anderson said. "Some people purchase term policies because they feel like that’s all they can afford to spend. Some people have a difficult time saving money, and the whole, universal and variable life policies are a forced savings for them."

The primary advantage to term life insurance, whether you choose an annual renewal policy or a fixed 20-year policy, is price. "You are getting more bang for the buck because term policies offer the least expensive premiums per $1,000 in coverage," he said. "The disadvantage to term is that if you outlive the 10- or 20-year period of the term policy and still need the same amount of coverage, it will cost you more."

Whole life, variable life and universal life policies build cash values that can provide money for future needs. The consumer accepts the risk of cash value growth with the variable life product; the company accepts the risk with whole life and universal life contracts.

With both whole life and universal life policies, the policy’s "cash value" is determined by the company, based on either whatever measure the company is using to index the cash value or a minimum guarantee.

And, while the two types of coverage share many of the same characteristics, whole life policies offer a fixed premium, and universal life policies offer some flexibility in premium costs.

"The premium for whole life is generally more expensive, but this type of policy offers stronger guarantees," Anderson said. "The advantage to universal life coverage is that you can control the amount of premium you pay, as long as you pay the company’s minimum premium. However, that’s also the disadvantage to universal coverage because it’s human nature to pay as little as possible, which can jeopardize your insurance coverage down the road and can cause your premiums to increase."

In comparison, variable life insurance offers a greater opportunity for "cash value" growth. Along with this opportunity comes risk.

"We can all understand risk as we reflect over the past 18 months," Anderson said. "Variable means exactly what it said. Your cash value will vary according to your selections of stock market sub-accounts offered by that particular company."

The only guarantees offered by a variable life insurance policy are the maximum mortality charges and the maximum expenses of the policy.

"In the past few years, this type of coverage has been attractive to those people seeking greater opportunity for growth. There are many people who only want term and then there are those who believe cash value policies are the best. What is comfortable for me, may not be comfortable for you," Anderson said.

"We’ve all been told it’s better to own a house than to rent because when you own a house you build equity. It is equity that allows us to make a second mortgage when money is needed for education or a new car. If you hadn’t built that equity you might not have been able to come up with those extra dollars," he adds. "Also, if we knew when we were going to die, we would know exactly what coverage to buy. That is why they call it life insurance."</span></div></div>

What is wrong? What means that aiftool.exe is accessible? I have aiftool.exe in &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;\Epoc32\Release\winc\udeb and in &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;\Epoc32\Release\winc\urel.

I am building a new patio/sunroom, and I have framed up a small shear wall, along with openings for 2 new 4x6 windows. As I tried to install the windows today, I realize that the openings are out of square. One opening is not allowing the top of the window to sit into the opening by 1/8 inch, and I don't have enough slack on the other side to bring it up.

The other opening next to it, is out of square too far to one side. So I will need to put in more than shims to make it attach.

Any practical suggestions?

Rough openings are exactly as they are called, rough. Yours sounds extra rough though. All rough openings are made to have space to add shims, sometimes the rough openings, because of conditions, can only take shims on one side or the other.

As a rule of thumb I usually do not use no more than 2 shims on a side. If the rough opening (RO) has need for more, I usually add a piece of plywood to bring the opening down where 2 shims will work on a given side. There is no rule that says the plywood has to be the full length of the opening. I also rip my plywood filler 1/4" narrower than the RO material. Dimensional lumber shrinks, and this smaller dimension keeps the plywood from giving you trouble later on.

Edit 12-31-13 I need to clarify the shim statement. The 2 shims I refer to is, per placement. I use what is called undercoursing shingles used in roofing. They need to be made narrower, whether split, razor knifed, or table sawn. You get a lot for the money. The ones in the little packs aren't even uniform in their taper. There will obviously be a number of placements per side, depending on how large any given item is to be fastened.

On the opening that is too small at the top, if it is a non bearing wall, you may be able to remove the jack stud and replace it with thinner material. If it is a bearing wall, a picture would be handy to see what the conditions are. It may be as simple as using a chisel to trim the little you need to get the window in. It may only need a good smack with the hammer to shift the framing enough to get the window in. A couple well placed 12D-16D toenails may help too. Give it a whack, literally.

I can't determine anymore to do without seeing the conditions. Bearing, non bearing, jack studs, common studs etc...

Also check the ends of the wall that the windows are in, the wall may have racked, which in turn will make your ROs out of square.

I am talking about those small and narrow screwdrivers with a thin handle. I can't get a tight enough grip on the handle to generate enough torque to remove a small screw. Do I have to use something else with it?

share|improve this question
This question belongs on SuperUser,with a title like "how do I remove the screws on a MacBook Pro? –  Jay Bazuzi Oct 21 '11 at 2:11
No the question is still valid. How do you apply torque on needle like scewdriver? –  Johny Oct 21 '11 at 6:36
Really Baz? Nothing better to do? –  Evil Elf Oct 21 '11 at 14:04
Yea those screw drivers are used for clocks, watches and jewellery where very little torque is required! Those are tinkering screw drivers-- and as you have witnessed not designed for the job you want them for. Get those @Niall Suggested. –  ppumkin Oct 21 '11 at 16:32

There are precision screwdrivers available that have larger handles, such as this one from Home Depot:

Home depot precision screwdriver set

In general, you press down on the tip while you screw in or out: this helps to hold the screwdriver in the slots in the screw head and allows you to use more force to turn the screw.

I happened to buy the exact same one (without knowing about the answer). They did a great job. You need philip head #00. #000 wont do it. –  Johny Oct 21 '11 at 6:32
I'd recommend against -interchangeable- precision screwdrivers with plastic parts, especially if you need extra torque. I've had sets like this break on me. I prefer the all metal sets now. –  Hemm Oct 24 '11 at 0:10

Use a pair of pliers to grab the screwdriver, and while applying downward force to the screwdriver (so it doesn't slip and strip your screws), carefully apply pressure using the pliers.

share|improve this answer
I was thinking on the same idea but if you are working with laptop, avoid this method as it can easily scratch the laptop surface. The above pair does a very nice job. –  Johny Oct 21 '11 at 6:35
I agree. It's better to have the right tools (bigger handles), but in a pinch pilers will work. You do absolutely have to be careful though, as you do no matter what tools you're using to work on anything you don't want to break. –  gregmac Oct 21 '11 at 16:26

Abstract:According to many researchers, implicit learning in the serial reaction-time task is predominantly motor based and therefore should be independent of stimulus modality. Previous research on the task, however, has focused almost completely on the visual domain. Here we investigated sequence learning when the imperative stimuli were presented tactilely to the fingers. Learning in this task was compared to sequence learning in a typical visual task, using very similar experimental conditions. The results indicate that sequential learning occurs in the tactile task, though to a lesser degree than in its visual counterpart. Furthermore, there was similar cross-modal transfer in both directions, meaning that transfer from the visual to the tactile task was partial. It is proposed that sequence learning involves a stimulus-specific component in the visual but not in the tactile task.

E How to Complete Installation Prerequisite Tasks Manually

This appendix provides instructions for how to complete configuration tasks manually that Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) and the installer (OUI) normally complete during installation. Use this appendix as a guide if you cannot use the fixup script.

This appendix contains the following information:

E.1 Configuring SSH Manually on All Cluster Nodes

Passwordless SSH configuration is a mandatory installation requirement. SSH is used during installation to configure cluster member nodes, and SSH is used after installation by configuration assistants, Oracle Enterprise Manager, OPatch, and other features.

Automatic Passwordless SSH configuration using OUI creates RSA encryption keys on all nodes of the cluster. If you have system restrictions that require you to set up SSH manually, such as using DSA keys, then use this procedure as a guide to set up passwordless SSH.

In the examples that follow, the Oracle software owner listed is the grid user.

If SSH is not available, then OUI attempts to use rsh and rcp instead. However, these services are disabled by default on most Linux systems.


The supported version of SSH for Linux distributions is OpenSSH.

This section contains the following:

E.1.1 Checking Existing SSH Configuration on the System

To determine if SSH is running, enter the following command:

$ pgrep sshd

If SSH is running, then the response to this command is one or more process ID numbers. In the home directory of the installation software owner (grid, oracle), use the command ls -al to ensure that the .ssh directory is owned and writable only by the user.

You need either an RSA or a DSA key for the SSH protocol. RSA is used with the SSH 1.5 protocol, while DSA is the default for the SSH 2.0 protocol. With OpenSSH, you can use either RSA or DSA. The instructions that follow are for SSH1. If you have an SSH2 installation, and you cannot use SSH1, then refer to your SSH distribution documentation to configure SSH1 compatibility or to configure SSH2 with DSA.

E.1.2 Configuring SSH on Cluster Nodes

To configure SSH, you must first create RSA or DSA keys on each cluster node, and then copy all the keys generated on all cluster node members into an authorized keys file that is identical on each node. Note that the SSH files must be readable only by root and by the software installation user (oracle, grid), as SSH ignores a private key file if it is accessible by others. In the examples that follow, the DSA key is used.

You must configure SSH separately for each Oracle software installation owner that you intend to use for installation.

To configure SSH, complete the following:

E.1.2.1 Create SSH Directory, and Create SSH Keys On Each Node

Complete the following steps on each node:

  1. Log in as the software owner (in this example, the grid user).

  2. To ensure that you are logged in as grid, and to verify that the user ID matches the expected user ID you have assigned to the grid user, enter the commands id and id grid. Ensure that Oracle user group and user and the user terminal window process you are using have group and user IDs are identical. For example:

    $ id 
    uid=502(grid) gid=501(oinstall) groups=501(oinstall),502(grid,asmadmin,asmdba)
    $ id grid
  3. If necessary, create the .ssh directory in the grid user's home directory, and set permissions on it to ensure that only the oracle user has read and write permissions:

    $ mkdir ~/.ssh
    $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh


    SSH configuration will fail if the permissions are not set to 700.
  4. Enter the following command:

    $ /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t dsa

    At the prompts, accept the default location for the key file (press Enter).


    SSH with passphrase is not supported for Oracle Clusterware 11g release 2 and later releases.

    This command writes the DSA public key to the ~/.ssh/ file and the private key to the ~/.ssh/id_dsa file.

    Never distribute the private key to anyone not authorized to perform Oracle software installations.

  5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 on each node that you intend to make a member of the cluster, using the DSA key.

E.1.2.2 Add All Keys to a Common authorized_keys File

Complete the following steps:

  1. On the local node, change directories to the .ssh directory in the Oracle Grid Infrastructure owner's home directory (typically, either grid or oracle).

    Then, add the DSA key to the authorized_keys file using the following commands:

    $ cat >> authorized_keys
    $ ls

    In the ssh directory, you should see the keys that you have created, and the file authorized_keys.

  2. On the local node, use SCP (Secure Copy) or SFTP (Secure FTP) to copy the authorized_keys file to the oracle user .ssh directory on a remote node. The following example is with SCP, on a node called node2, with the Oracle Grid Infrastructure owner grid, where the grid user path is /home/grid:

    [grid@node1 .ssh]$ scp authorized_keys node2:/home/grid/.ssh/

    You are prompted to accept a DSA key. Enter Yes, and you see that the node you are copying to is added to the known_hosts file.

    When prompted, provide the password for the grid user, which should be the same on all nodes in the cluster. The authorized_keys file is copied to the remote node.

    Your output should be similar to the following, where xxx represents parts of a valid IP address:

    The authenticity of host 'node2 ( can't be established.
    DSA key fingerprint is 7e:60:60:ae:40:40:d1:a6:f7:4e:zz:me:a7:48:ae:f6:7e.
    Warning: Permanently added 'node1,' (dsa) to the list
    of known hosts
    grid@node2's password:
    authorized_keys       100%             828             7.5MB/s      00:00
  3. Using SSH, log in to the node where you copied the authorized_keys file. Then change to the .ssh directory, and using the cat command, add the DSA keys for the second node to the authorized_keys file, clicking Enter when you are prompted for a password, so that passwordless SSH is set up:

    [grid@node1 .ssh]$ ssh node2
    [grid@node2 grid]$ cd .ssh
    [grid@node2 ssh]$ cat  >> authorized_keys

    Repeat steps 2 and 3 from each node to each other member node in the cluster.

    When you have added keys from each cluster node member to the authorized_keys file on the last node you want to have as a cluster node member, then use scp to copy the authorized_keys file with the keys from all nodes back to each cluster node member, overwriting the existing version on the other nodes.

    To confirm that you have all nodes in the authorized_keys file, enter the command more authorized_keys, and determine if there is a DSA key for each member node. The file lists the type of key (ssh-dsa), followed by the key, and then followed by the user and server. For example:

    ssh-dsa AAAABBBB . . . = grid@node1


    The grid user's /.ssh/authorized_keys file on every node must contain the contents from all of the /.ssh/ files that you generated on all cluster nodes.

E.1.3 Enabling SSH User Equivalency on Cluster Nodes

After you have copied the authorized_keys file that contains all keys to each node in the cluster, complete the following procedure, in the order listed. In this example, the Oracle Grid Infrastructure software owner is named grid:

  1. On the system where you want to run OUI, log in as the grid user.

  2. Use the following command syntax, where hostname1, hostname2, and so on, are the public host names (alias and fully qualified domain name) of nodes in the cluster to run SSH from the local node to each node, including from the local node to itself, and from each node to each other node:

    [grid@nodename]$ ssh hostname1 date
    [grid@nodename]$ ssh hostname2 date

    For example:

    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh node1 date
    The authenticity of host 'node1 (' can't be established.
    DSA key fingerprint is 7z:60:60:zz:48:48:z1:a0:f7:4e.
    Warning: Permanently added 'node1,' (DSA) to the list of
    known hosts.
    Mon Dec 4 11:08:13 PST 2006
    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh date
    The authenticity of host ' (' can't be
    Warning: Permanently added ',' (DSA) to the
    list of known hosts.
    Mon Dec 4 11:08:13 PST 2006
    [grid@node1 grid]$ ssh node2 date
    Mon Dec 4 11:08:35 PST 2006

    At the end of this process, the public host name for each member node should be registered in the known_hosts file for all other cluster nodes.

    If you are using a remote client to connect to the local node, and you see a message similar to "Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding," then this means that your authorized keys file is configured correctly, but your SSH configuration has X11 forwarding enabled. To correct this issue, proceed to "Setting Display and X11 Forwarding Configuration".

  3. Repeat step 2 on each cluster node member.

If you have configured SSH correctly, then you can now use the ssh or scp commands without being prompted for a password. For example:

[grid@node1 ~]$ ssh node2 date
Mon Feb 26 23:34:42 UTC 2009
[grid@node1 ~]$ ssh node1 date
Mon Feb 26 23:34:48 UTC 2009

If any node prompts for a password, then verify that the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on that node contains the correct public keys, and that you have created an Oracle software owner with identical group membership and IDs.

E.2 Configuring Kernel Parameters

This section contains the following:


The kernel parameter and shell limit values shown in the following section are recommended values only. For production database systems, Oracle recommends that you tune these values to optimize the performance of the system. Refer to your operating system documentation for more information about tuning kernel parameters.

E.2.1 Minimum Parameter Settings for Installation

During installation, or when you run the Cluster Verification Utility (cluvfy) with the flag -fixup, a fixup script is generated. This script updates required kernel packages if necessary to minimum values.

If you cannot use the fixup scripts, then review the following table to set values manually:

Parameter Value File
semmsl semmns semopm semmni 250 32000 100 128 /proc/sys/kernel/sem
shmmax Minimum allocation:

536870912 (512 MB)

Maximum allocation:

  • Linux x86: At least 1 byte less than 4 GB, or 4294967295.

    Recommended: More than half the physical memory.

  • Linux x86-64: At least 1 byte less than the physical memory

    Recommended: More than half the physical memory

See My Oracle Support Note 567506.1 for additional information about configuring shmmax.

shmmni 4096 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni
shmall 2097152 /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
file-max 6815744 /proc/sys/fs/file-max
ip_local_port_range Minimum: 9000

Maximum: 65500

rmem_default 262144 /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default
rmem_max 4194304 /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
wmem_default 262144 /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default
wmem_max 1048576 /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
aio-max-nr 1048576 /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr


If the current value for any parameter is greater than the value listed in this table, then the Fixup scripts do not change the value of that parameter.

E.2.2 Additional Parameter and Kernel Settings for SUSE Linux

On SUSE systems only, complete the following steps as needed:

  1. Enter the following command to cause the system to read the /etc/sysctl.conf file when it restarts:

    # /sbin/chkconfig boot.sysctl on
  2. On SUSE 10 systems only, use a text editor to change the /etc/sysconfig/boot.sysctl parameter RUN_PARALLEL flag from yes to no.

  3. Enter the GID of the oinstall group as the value for the parameter /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group. Doing this grants members of oinstall a group permission to create shared memory segments.

    For example, where the oinstall group GID is 501:

    # echo 501 > /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group

    After running this command, use vi to add the following text to /etc/sysctl.conf, and enable the boot.sysctl script to run on system restart:



    Only one group can be defined as the vm.hugetlb_shm_group.
  4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 on all other nodes in the cluster.

E.3 Checking OCFS2 Version Manually

To check your OCFS version manually, enter the following commands:

modinfo ocfs2
rpm -qa |grep ocfs2

Ensure that ocfs2console and ocfs2-tools are at least version 1.2.7, and that the other OCFS2 components correspond to the pattern ocfs2-kernel_version-1.2.7 or greater. If you want to install Oracle RAC on a shared home, then the OCFS version must be 1.4.1 or greater.

How to See If a File System Needs Checking

  1. Become superuser.

  2. Unmount the file system if it is mounted.

    # umount /mount-point
  3. Check the file system.

    # fsck -m /dev/rdsk/device-name

    In this command, the state flag in the superblock of the file system you specify is checked to see whether the file system is clean or requires checking.

    If you omit the device argument, all the UFS file systems listed in /etc/vfstab with a fsck pass value greater than 0 are checked.

Example--Seeing If a File System Needs Checking

The following example shows that the file system needs checking.

# fsck -m /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s6
** /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s6
ufs fsck: sanity check: /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s6 needs checking</span></div></div>

Adieu, at present.

I'M NOT TOO YOUNG FOR GOD TO SEE. “I'm not too young for God to see, He knows my name and nature too; And all day long, he looks at me, And sees my actions through and thro.' He listens to the words I say, And knows the thoughts I have within, And whether I am at work or play He's sure to know it if I sin. O, how could children tell a lie, Or cheat in play, or steal or fight, If they remembered God was nigh, And had them always in his sight. Then when I want to do amiss, However pleasant it may be, I'll always strive to think of this— I'm not too young for God to see.”

Chapter XI

Between Two Banks

BY eight in the evening, the country, as the state of the sky had foretold, was enveloped in complete darkness. The moon being new had not yet risen. From the middle of the river the banks were invisible. The cliffs were confounded with the heavy, low-hanging clouds. At intervals a puff of wind came from the east, but it soon died away in the narrow valley of the Angara.

The darkness could not fail to favor in a considerable degree the plans of the fugitives. Indeed, although the Tartar outposts must have been drawn up on both banks, the raft had a good chance of passing unperceived. It was not likely either that the besiegers would have barred the river above Irkutsk, since they knew that the Russians could not expect any help from the south of the province. Besides this, before long Nature would herself establish a barrier, by cementing with frost the blocks of ice accumulated between the two banks.

Perfect silence now reigned on board the raft. The voices of the pilgrims were no longer heard. They still prayed, but their prayer was but a murmur, which could not reach as far as either bank. The fugitives lay flat on the platform, so that the raft was scarcely above the level of the water. The old boatman crouched down forward among his men, solely occupied in keeping off the ice blocks, a maneuver which was performed without noise.

The drifting of the ice was a favorable circumstance so long as it did not offer an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the raft. If that object had been alone on the water, it would have run a risk of being seen, even in the darkness, but, as it was, it was confounded with these moving masses, of all shapes and sizes, and the tumult caused by the crashing of the blocks against each other concealed likewise any suspicious noises.

There was a sharp frost. The fugitives suffered cruelly, having no other shelter than a few branches of birch. They cowered down together, endeavoring to keep each other warm, the temperature being now ten degrees below freezing point. The wind, though slight, having passed over the snow-clad mountains of the east, pierced them through and through.

Michael and Nadia, lying in the afterpart of the raft, bore this increase of suffering without complaint. Jolivet and Blount, placed near them, stood these first assaults of the Siberian winter as well as they could. No one now spoke, even in a low voice. Their situation entirely absorbed them. At any moment an incident might occur, which they could not escape unscathed.

For a man who hoped soon to accomplish his mission, Michael was singularly calm. Even in the gravest conjunctures, his energy had never abandoned him. He already saw the moment when he would be at last allowed to think of his mother, of Nadia, of himself! He now only dreaded one final unhappy chance; this was, that the raft might be completely barred by ice before reaching Irkutsk. He thought but of this, determined beforehand, if necessary, to attempt some bold stroke.

Restored by a few hours’ rest, Nadia had regained the physical energy which misery had sometimes overcome, although without ever having shaken her moral energy. She thought, too, that if Michael had to make any fresh effort to attain his end, she must be there to guide him. But in proportion as she drew nearer to Irkutsk, the image of her father rose more and more clearly before her mind. She saw him in the invested town, far from those he loved, but, as she never doubted, struggling against the invaders with all the spirit of his patriotism. In a few hours, if Heaven favored them, she would be in his arms, giving him her mother’s last words, and nothing should ever separate them again. If the term of Wassili Fedor’s exile should never come to an end, his daughter would remain exiled with him. Then, by a natural transition, she came back to him who would have enabled her to see her father once more, to that generous companion, that “brother,” who, the Tartars driven back, would retake the road to Moscow, whom she would perhaps never meet again!

As to Alcide Jolivet and Harry Blount, they had one and the same thought, which was, that the situation was extremely dramatic, and that, well worked up, it would furnish a most deeply interesting article. The Englishman thought of the readers of the Daily Telegraph, and the Frenchman of those of his Cousin Madeleine. At heart, both were not without feeling some emotion.

“Well, so much the better!” thought Alcide Jolivet, “to move others, one must be moved one’s self! I believe there is some celebrated verse on the subject, but hang me if I can recollect it!” And with his well-practiced eyes he endeavored to pierce the gloom of the river.

Every now and then a burst of light dispelling the darkness for a time, exhibited the banks under some fantastic aspect — either a forest on fire, or a still burning village. The Angara was occasionally illuminated from one bank to the other. The blocks of ice formed so many mirrors, which, reflecting the flames on every point and in every color, were whirled along by the caprice of the current. The raft passed unperceived in the midst of these floating masses.

The danger was not at these points.

But a peril of another nature menaced the fugitives. One that they could not foresee, and, above all, one that they could not avoid. Chance discovered it to Alcide Jolivet in this way:— Lying at the right side of the raft, he let his hand hang over into the water. Suddenly he was surprised by the impression made on it by the current. It seemed to be of a slimy consistency, as if it had been made of mineral oil. Alcide, aiding his touch by his sense of smell, could not be mistaken. It was really a layer of liquid naphtha, floating on the surface of the river!

Was the raft really floating on this substance, which is in the highest degree combustible? Where had this naphtha come from? Was it a natural phenomenon taking place on the surface of the Angara, or was it to serve as an engine of destruction, put in motion by the Tartars? Did they intend to carry conflagration into Irkutsk?

Such were the questions which Alcide asked himself, but he thought it best to make this incident known only to Harry Blount, and they both agreed in not alarming their companions by revealing to them this new danger.

It is known that the soil of Central Asia is like a sponge impregnated with liquid hydrogen. At the port of Bakou, on the Persian frontier, on the Caspian Sea, in Asia Minor, in China, on the Yuen-Kiang, in the Burman Empire, springs of mineral oil rise in thousands to the surface of the ground. It is an “oil country,” similar to the one which bears this name in North America.

During certain religious festivals, principally at the port of Bakou, the natives, who are fire-worshipers, throw liquid naphtha on the surface of the sea, which buoys it up, its density being inferior to that of water. Then at nightfall, when a layer of mineral oil is thus spread over the Caspian, they light it, and exhibit the matchless spectacle of an ocean of fire undulating and breaking into waves under the breeze.

But what is only a sign of rejoicing at Bakou, might prove a fearful disaster on the waters of the Angara. Whether it was set on fire by malevolence or imprudence, in the twinkling of an eye a conflagration might spread beyond Irkutsk. On board the raft no imprudence was to be feared; but everything was to be dreaded from the conflagrations on both banks of the Angara, for should a lighted straw or even a spark blow into the water, it would inevitably set the whole current of naphtha in a blaze.

The apprehensions of Jolivet and Blount may be better understood than described. Would it not be prudent, in face of this new danger, to land on one of the banks and wait there? “At any rate,” said Alcide, “whatever the danger may be, I know some one who will not land!”

He alluded to Michael Strogoff.

In the meantime, on glided the raft among the masses of ice which were gradually getting closer and closer together. Up till then, no Tartar detachment had been seen, which showed that the raft was not abreast of the outposts. At about ten o’clock, however, Harry Blount caught sight of a number of black objects moving on the ice blocks. Springing from one to the other, they rapidly approached.

“Tartars!” he thought. And creeping up to the old boatman, he pointed out to him the suspicious objects.

The old man looked attentively. “They are only wolves!” said he. “I like them better than Tartars. But we must defend ourselves, and without noise!”

The fugitives would indeed have to defend themselves against these ferocious beasts, whom hunger and cold had sent roaming through the province. They had smelt out the raft, and would soon attack it. The fugitives must struggle without using firearms, for they could not now be far from the Tartar posts. The women and children were collected in the middle of the raft, and the men, some armed with poles, others with their knives, stood prepared to repulse their assailants. They did not make a sound, but the howls of the wolves filled the air.

Michael did not wish to remain inactive. He lay down at the side attacked by the savage pack. He drew his knife, and every time that a wolf passed within his reach, his hand found out the way to plunge his weapon into its throat. Neither were Jolivet and Blount idle, but fought bravely with the brutes. Their companions gallantly seconded them. The battle was carried on in silence, although many of the fugitives received severe bites.

The struggle did not appear as if it would soon terminate. The pack was being continually reinforced from the right bank of the Angara. “This will never be finished!” said Alcide, brandishing his dagger, red with blood.

In fact, half an hour after the commencement of the attack, the wolves were still coming in hundreds across the ice. The exhausted fugitives were getting weaker. The fight was going against them. At that moment, a group of ten huge wolves, raging with hunger, their eyes glowing in the darkness like red coals, sprang onto the raft. Jolivet and his companion threw themselves into the midst of the fierce beasts, and Michael was finding his way towards them, when a sudden change took place.

In a few moments the wolves had deserted not only the raft, but also the ice on the river. All the black bodies dispersed, and it was soon certain that they had in all haste regained the shore. Wolves, like other beasts of prey, require darkness for their proceedings, and at that moment a bright light illuminated the entire river.

It was the blaze of an immense fire. The whole of the small town of Poshkavsk was burning. The Tartars were indeed there, finishing their work. From this point, they occupied both banks beyond Irkutsk. The fugitives had by this time reached the dangerous part of their voyage, and they were still twenty miles from the capital.

It was now half past eleven. The raft continued to glide on amongst the ice, with which it was quite mingled, but gleams of light sometimes fell upon it. The fugitives stretched on the platform did not permit themselves to make a movement by which they might be betrayed.

The conflagration was going on with frightful rapidity. The houses, built of fir-wood, blazed like torches — a hundred and fifty flaming at once. With the crackling of the fire was mingled the yells of the Tartars. The old boatman, getting a foothold on a near piece of ice, managed to shove the raft towards the right bank, by doing which a distance of from three to four hundred feet divided it from the flames of Poshkavsk.

Nevertheless, the fugitives, lighted every now and then by the glare, would have been undoubtedly perceived had not the incendiaries been too much occupied in their work of destruction.

It may be imagined what were the apprehensions of Jolivet and Blount, when they thought of the combustible liquid on which the raft floated. Sparks flew in millions from the houses, which resembled so many glowing furnaces. They rose among the volumes of smoke to a height of five or six hundred feet. On the right bank, the trees and cliffs exposed to the fire looked as if they likewise were burning. A spark falling on the surface of the Angara would be sufficient to spread the flames along the current, and to carry disaster from one bank to the other. The result of this would be in a short time the destruction of the raft and of all those which it carried.

But, happily, the breeze did not blow from that side. It came from the east, and drove the flames towards the left. It was just possible that the fugitives would escape this danger. The blazing town was at last passed. Little by little the glare grew dimmer, the crackling became fainter, and the flames at last disappeared behind the high cliffs which arose at an abrupt turn of the river.

By this time it was nearly midnight. The deep gloom again threw its protecting shadows over the raft. The Tartars were there, going to and fro near the river. They could not be seen, but they could be heard. The fires of the outposts burned brightly.

In the meantime it had become necessary to steer more carefully among the blocks of ice. The old boatman stood up, and the moujiks resumed their poles. They had plenty of work, the management of the raft becoming more and more difficult as the river was further obstructed.

Michael had crept forward; Jolivet followed; both listened to what the old boatman and his men were saying.

“Look out on the right!”

“There are blocks drifting on to us on the left!”

“Fend! fend off with your boat-hook!”

“Before an hour is past we shall be stopped!”

“If it is God’s will!” answered the old man. “Against His will there is nothing to be done.”

“You hear them,” said Alcide.

“Yes,” replied Michael, “but God is with us!”

The situation became more and more serious. Should the raft be stopped, not only would the fugitives not reach Irkutsk, but they would be obliged to leave their floating platform, for it would be very soon smashed to pieces in the ice. The osier ropes would break, the fir trunks torn asunder would drift under the hard crust, and the unhappy people would have no refuge but the ice blocks themselves. Then, when day came, they would be seen by the Tartars, and massacred without mercy!

Michael returned to the spot where Nadia was waiting for him. He approached the girl, took her hand, and put to her the invariable question: “Nadia, are you ready?” to which she replied as usual, “I am ready!”

For a few versts more the raft continued to drift amongst the floating ice. Should the river narrow, it would soon form an impassable barrier. Already they seemed to drift slower. Every moment they encountered severe shocks or were compelled to make detours; now, to avoid running foul of a block, there to enter a channel, of which it was necessary to take advantage. At length the stoppages became still more alarming. There were only a few more hours of night. Could the fugitives not reach Irkutsk by five o’clock in the morning, they must lose all hope of ever getting there at all.

At half-past one, notwithstanding all efforts, the raft came up against a thick barrier and stuck fast. The ice, which was drifting down behind it, pressed it still closer, and kept it motionless, as though it had been stranded.

At this spot the Angara narrowed, it being half its usual breadth. This was the cause of the accumulation of ice, which became gradually soldered together, under the double influence of the increased pressure and of the cold. Five hundred feet beyond, the river widened again, and the blocks, gradually detaching themselves from the floe, continued to drift towards Irkutsk. It was probable that had the banks not narrowed, the barrier would not have formed. But the misfortune was irreparable, and the fugitives must give up all hope of attaining their object.

Had they possessed the tools usually employed by whalers to cut channels through the ice-fields — had they been able to get through to where the river widened — they might have been saved. But they had nothing which could make the least incision in the ice, hard as granite in the excessive frost. What were they to do?

At that moment several shots on the right bank startled the unhappy fugitives. A shower of balls fell on the raft. The devoted passengers had been seen. Immediately afterwards shots were heard fired from the left bank. The fugitives, taken between two fires, became the mark of the Tartar sharpshooters. Several were wounded, although in the darkness it was only by chance that they were hit.

“Come, Nadia,” whispered Michael in the girl’s ear.

Without making a single remark, “ready for anything,” Nadia took Michael’s hand.

“We must cross the barrier,” he said in a low tone. “Guide me, but let no one see us leave the raft.”

Nadia obeyed. Michael and she glided rapidly over the floe in the obscurity, only broken now and again by the flashes from the muskets. Nadia crept along in front of Michael. The shot fell around them like a tempest of hail, and pattered on the ice. Their hands were soon covered with blood from the sharp and rugged ice over which they clambered, but still on they went.

In ten minutes, the other side of the barrier was reached. There the waters of the Angara again flowed freely. Several pieces of ice, detached gradually from the floe, were swept along in the current down towards the town. Nadia guessed what Michael wished to attempt. One of the blocks was only held on by a narrow strip.

“Come,” said Nadia. And the two crouched on the piece of ice, which their weight detached from the floe.

It began to drift. The river widened, the way was open. Michael and Nadia heard the shots, the cries of distress, the yells of the Tartars. Then, little by little, the sounds of agony and of ferocious joy grew faint in the distance.

“Our poor companions!” murmured Nadia.

For half an hour the current hurried along the block of ice which bore Michael and Nadia. They feared every moment that it would give way beneath them. Swept along in the middle of the current, it was unnecessary to give it an oblique direction until they drew near the quays of Irkutsk. Michael, his teeth tight set, his ear on the strain, did not utter a word. Never had he been so near his object. He felt that he was about to attain it!

Towards two in the morning a double row of lights glittered on the dark horizon in which were confounded the two banks of the Angara. On the right hand were the lights of Irkutsk; on the left, the fires of the Tartar camp.

Michael Strogoff was not more than half a verst from the town. “At last!” he murmured.

But suddenly Nadia uttered a cry.

At the cry Michael stood up on the ice, which was wavering. His hand was extended up the Angara. His face, on which a bluish light cast a peculiar hue, became almost fearful to look at, and then, as if his eyes had been opened to the bright blaze spreading across the river, “Ah!” he exclaimed, “then Heaven itself is against us!”

Sound impossible? That's exactly how fast backbones used by today's Internet providers operate-at speeds of up to 400 gigabits of data per second. What's more, in a year or two, they'll be even faster. However, this state-of-the art technology does not exist everywhere. In the real world, our high-tech offices appear to "blaze" at a tortoise-paced 1.5 megabits per second, and the last link to the home struggles along at a snail-paced 30 or 40 thousand bits per second. So while the computer gurus of Silicon Valley want to provide many things to us, this "last-mile" problem continues to tie them down.

This situation continues because the government protects local telephone companies (Telcos) from competition. Since there's no reason to change, they continue to make big money leasing 1.54-megabit lines to businesses. (Called T1 lines, these can cost from several hundred dollars to more than $1000 per month). In addition to this lucrative leasing business, Telcos also profit from multiple phone lines in residences.

If the Telcos allowed prices for bandwidth (the amount of signal sent from one place to another) to keep up with technology, they'd lose a ton of revenue. Remember, you and I cannot go into the telephone business. If we tried to open up a second (and better) telephone company, the government would shut down our company, confiscate our assets, and possibly send us to jail! Since competition is forbidden, normal market forces are not at work here.

The coming "end-run" years. Because of this Telco bottleneck as well as the inherent inefficiency of the telephone network (designed for the world of 1930, not the 21st century), the new world wide Internet data network simply cannot push through the morass of local telephone company systems. Instead, it's leapfrogging the telephone systems any way it can. This occurs in the following ways:

Through-cable television systems. This is a very good method from a technological standpoint; cable TV is a large pre-existing system with the proper type of architecture. Nonetheless, it's still pretty questionable whether the cable TV system will provide a good last-mile link. There are two main problems: (1) Because the government regulates cable TV, Telcos will probably donate enough money to politicians to make sure restrictions on the cable companies never go away. (2) Cable TV companies themselves have been rather predatory, generating significant ill will among customers. In fact, many people would rather not do business with them at all (if they had a choice).

Via satellite. Right now, there are several high-speed data satellite systems under construction that can deliver data to a home or office at rates well into the megabit per second range (perhaps even into the gigabit range). However, these systems will probably not be fully operational until 2002. After that time, they should effectively make an end-run around the Telco system. Currently, it appears they have not been restricted by the government. Therefore, there's probably not enough time left for Congress to shut them out of the market.

DSL. This is a telephone technology (as opposed to a data technology) called Digital Subscriber Line. It uses electronic boxes on each end of a standard telephone line to achieve speeds of up to 1.5 megabits per second. This technology comes in several flavors (ADSL, HDSL, etc.); however, they all are somewhat similar. Whether this will ever by implemented is questionable. It's really not in their best interest to do so, and Telcos might not readily embrace the technology. For example, Telcos left ISDN, the predecessor of DSL, to die on the vine. The same fate may await DSL. We'll just have to wait and see. Digital power line (DPL). This new technology uses a spread-spectrum power-line carrier technology to send up to 1.5 megabits (and in some cases more) over standard power lines. This system will probably be too limited for use 10 years from now, but it could be a major factor for the next five to eight years. As far as this author knows, there is no legislation limiting the use of this technology. Besides, it operates over existing power wiring, which is an enormous advantage.

How the DPL works. To send over a million bits per second through power lines, DPL uses what is termed a high-frequency conditioned power network (HFCPN). Rather than trying to push one signal very fast through the power lines, it breaks the signal into multiple streams, each of which is sent through the power system on a different frequency. Special receivers combine the mini-streams of data back into the original signal configuration.

These networks are rather complex but extremely stable and tolerant of electrical noise. They can provide between 6 MHz and 10 MHz of usable spectrum to far-end customers and more than 20 MHz of usable spectrum to near-end customers, for peak signal power levels of between 1mW and 10 mW. The overall spectral efficiency of the network depends upon a number of things, including:

* Customer type and number per distribution unit (typically up to 50).

* Type of multiple access requirements (dedicated or switched).

* Service requirement (voice, data, still or moving pictures, etc.).

* Digital or analog transmission technology.

* Modulation, coding, and compression schemes (data bits per unit of available spectrum).

* Traffic density mean and peak.

Under this scheme, you terminate the network interconnection conductors in a three-port directional coupler, known as a conditioning unit (CU) (Fig. 1). The basic elements of the CU are shown in Fig. 2 and include both high- and low-pass filter sections interconnected to form a frequency sensitive directional coupler, which has a network port (NP), communication distribution port (CDP), and electricity distribution port (EDP)

These CUs provide for the following:

* Safe and efficient interconnection of signals at speeds greater than 1 MHz.

* Directional propagation of signals.

* A reduced noise floor above 1 MHz.

* Isolation of variable customer loads.

* Suitable network service termination points for electricity and telecommunication services.

* Optimum spectral performance of the cable network.

Implementation. To implement DPL, utilities will require an investment in equipment and training. However, this investment will allow utilities to get into the Internet provider market more quickly.

The number of electrical utilities who will want to jump on this bandwagon is questionable, but you can certainly make plenty of money in these markets. Because the electrical utility market in the United States is deregulating for the first time, there are plenty of changes on the horizon. Most notably, competition will enter the market for the first time. As power markets become competitive, taking advantage of new opportunities will become important, and utilities will take a careful look at technologies like DPL. Hopefully, they will implement them quickly.

The possible utility company end-run. Earlier, we discussed methods of making end-runs around the last-mile data bottleneck. If they choose to do so, electric utility companies could provide a terrific way to get high-speed data to the house or office. They already have cables entering every home and office, and they have plenty of expertise running cables over long distances.

There are a lot of reasons why it makes sense for electric utilities to deliver data to their customers. The tree-and-branch architecture of power distribution systems is perfect for Internet data transmission. In addition, it's now very economical to run optical fiber along long-distance transmission lines. Special optical cables are available that are either combined with transmission ground wires (the top wire on long-distance power lines), or wrap around the ground wire. Many utility companies have begun doing this in the past several years, and some have a lot of fiber already in place. Initially done for communication between substations, other users now rent out some of the fibers. If you install enough fibers, it could form a very significant communications structure. In fact, it's quite possible electric utility companies could challenge Telcos for all forms of communications business in just a few years-and win.

Telco technology is not an efficient way of delivering digital communications; it's built around large, expensive central switches. Remember, networks are routed rather than switched. In other words, each piece of data contains its own destination address and routes toward its final destination at several points during its travels. The Telco network is slow, expensive, and smart. The routed network is fast, cheap, and stupid. The necessary intelligence is not in the network; it's attached to each end of the network. Fast and cheap is better than slow and expensive. And distributed intelligence is better than centralized intelligence.

What does the future hold? How all of this actually plays out over the next decade will be fascinating. At some point, political demagoguery will inevitably come into play: "The communications infrastructure is a national asset-we can't allow it to be turned over to people who are interested only in profits," or "Preserve it for the children," etc. There will probably even be several personal and financial battles. The forces of regulation and control cannot hold out indefinitely. But, they won't go without a fight. So, stay tuned.</span></div></div>

		Data Collection and Processing
	</span>
</h4>
<p>DCLM-Baseline was created by applying a series of cleaning, filtering, and deduplication steps to the raw Common Crawl data (DCLM-Pool). The key steps include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heuristic cleaning and filtering (reproduction of RefinedWeb)</li>
<li>Deduplication using a Bloom filter</li>
<li>Model-based filtering using a fastText classifier trained on instruction-formatted data (OpenHermes 2.5 and r/ExplainLikeImFive)</li>
</ol>
