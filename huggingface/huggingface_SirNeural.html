Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: The second earthquake caused 2 * 4 = 8 buildings to collapse. The third earthquake caused 2 * 8 = 16 buildings to collapse. The fourth earthquake caused 16 * 2 = 32 buildings to collapse. Including the first earthquake, the earthquakes caused 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 buildings to collapse. So the answer is 60. Question: James spends 40 years teaching. His partner has been teaching for 10 years less. How long is their combined experience?

Question: The school band has 30 songs in their repertoire. The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: The band played 5 + 7 = 12 songs in their first two sets. They have 30 - 12 = 18 songs left for the third set, fourth set and encore. Since they played 2 songs in the encore, they have 18 - 2 = 16 songs to play on the third and fourth sets. They will play 16 / 2 = 8 songs on average over the third and fourth sets. So the answer is 8. Question: Maria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase.

How much money must Maria earn to be able to buy the bike she wants? Answer:&quot;},&quot;targets&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Step-by-step reasoning process: Maria has $120 and received $250 from her mother.

What is the total number of balls in the fish tank? Step-by-step reasoning process: If there are 3 goldfish, and each is playing with ten red balls, then the number of red balls in the tank is 3 * 10 = 30.

Answer the following question. Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students. At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers. She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week. Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week. After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have? Step-by-step reasoning process: After one week, Susy has 100 + 40 = 140 followers. In the second week, Susy gains 40 / 2 = 20 new followers. In the third week, Susy gains 20 / 2 = 10 new followers. In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140 + 20 + 10 = 170 total followers. After one week, Sarah has 50 + 90 = 140 followers. After the second week, Sarah gains 90 / 3 = 30 followers. After the third week, Sarah gains 30 / 3 = 10 followers. So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140 + 30 + 10 = 180 total followers. Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180. The answer is 180. Answer the following question. A bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals? Step-by-step reasoning process: The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = 200 pounds from berries. It gained 2 * 200 = 400 pounds from acorns. It still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds. Thus, it gained 400 / 2 = 200 pounds from salmon. Therefore, the bear gained 400 - 200 = 200 pounds from small animals. The answer is 200. Answer the following question.

The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne? [Answer]: First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts / gallon = 160 quarts. Then multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50 / quart = $8000. Then multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * .2 = $1600. Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $6400. So the answer is 6400.

This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., transfer RNA), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-uracil) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures. In addition, base-pairing between transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) forms the basis for the molecular recognition events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins via the genetic code. Answer this question: what are the base pair rules for rna? # ANSWER The relevant information is: This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., transfer RNA), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-uracil) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures.

She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them? Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. It takes 15 minutes to bake, 30 minutes for the white icing to harden and 30 minutes for the chocolate icing to harden so it takes 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 minutes. Every hour has 60 minutes and it takes her 2 hours so it takes 60 * 2 = 120 minutes to make the cookies. It takes 120 minutes to make the cookies from start to finish and she spends 75 minutes baking and hardening icing so it takes her 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to make the batter and cool the cookies..

If Bob buys his lumber in 8-foot-long boards, planning to cut some of them for the shorter lengths he'll need, how many 8-foot long planks will he need to construct 10 raised beds? Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. Each raised bed is 8 feet long, the same as the planks, so the long sides of the beds will each be 1 plank long. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, or 2 / 8 = 1 / 4 the length of the planks, so the short sides will each be 1 / 4 plank long. Each bed is 2 feet tall, and the planks are 1 foot wide, so each side will need 2 pieces of lumber of the same length. So each bed will require 2 * 2 * 1.25 = 4 * 1.25 = 5 planks of wood. Bob wants to build 10 raised beds, so he will need 10 * 5 = 50 planks of lumber.. The answer is: 50. Rick has 130 cards. He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards.

After keeping 15 cards, Rick had 130 cards - 15 cards = 115 cards left. The total number of cards given by Rick to his 8 friends was 8 friends x 12 cards / friend = 96 cards. There were 2 sisters x 3 cards / sister = 6 cards given to Rick's sisters. So, there were 96 cards + 6 cards = 102 cards left after Rick gave Miguel some cards. Therefore, 115 cards - 102 cards = 13 cards were given to Miguel..

Each experienced sailor was paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors. If the inexperienced sailors were paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek, calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors. Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. If the experienced sailors received 1 / 5 times more money than the inexperienced sailors, they were paid 1 / 5 * 10 = $2 more. The total hourly earnings for the experienced sailors each is $10 + $2 = $12. In a 60 - hour workweek, an experienced sailor is paid 60 * $12 = $720. In a month, an experienced sailor is paid 4 * $720 = $2880. If there were five inexperienced sailors, the total number of experienced sailors was 17 - 5 = 12. If each experienced sailor was paid $2280 per month, the total combined monthly earnings for the experienced is 12 * 2880 = $34560.. The answer is: 34560. Ruby is taking dance lessons.

Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. The classes in the pack cost $7.5 each because 75 / 10 = 7.5. An additional class costs $10 because 7.5 x (1 + (1 / 3)) = 10. She buys 3 extra classes because 13 - 10 = 3. Her three additional classes cost $30 because 3 x 10 = 30. Her total cost is $105 because 75 + 30 = 105.. The answer is: 105.

Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: The second earthquake caused 2 * 4 = 8 buildings to collapse. The third earthquake caused 2 * 8 = 16 buildings to collapse. The fourth earthquake caused 16 * 2 = 32 buildings to collapse. Including the first earthquake, the earthquakes caused 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 buildings to collapse. So the answer is 60. Question: James spends 40 years teaching. His partner has been teaching for 10 years less. How long is their combined experience? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: His partner has been teaching for 40 - 10 = 30 years. So together they have 40 + 30 = 70 years of experience. So the answer is 70. Question: The school band has 30 songs in their repertoire. The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: The band played 5 + 7 = 12 songs in their first two sets. They have 30 - 12 = 18 songs left for the third set, fourth set and encore. Since they played 2 songs in the encore, they have 18 - 2 = 16 songs to play on the third and fourth sets. They will play 16 / 2 = 8 songs on average over the third and fourth sets. So the answer is 8. Question: Maria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase.

Traveling in soil used as ballast on cargo ships, they came in through the seaport of Mobile, Alabama. They build mounds, usually no larger than 46 cm (18 in) in diameter and 46 cm (18 in) in height, although in Alabama some mounds have been reported to be over 60 cm (2.0 ft) high and larger, especially in fields where cattle graze. They build on soil close to homes and other buildings, and sometimes forage indoors for food and moisture. They are a nuisance, and can threaten sleeping or bedridden individuals and pets. Occasionally, they feed on vegetable plants in home gardens. The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather, when they invade flower beds while seeking warmth and moisture.

If she has already mowed three 20 x 15 foot lawns, how many more square feet does she have to mow to earn enough for the book set? Answer: She has mowed 900 square feet because 3 x 20 x 15 = 900. She has earned $90 because 900 x .1 = 90. She has to earn $60 more dollars because 150 - 90 = 60. She has to mow 600 more square feet of lawns because 60 / .1 = 600. The answer is 600.

How much in total did Martha spend on textbooks? Answer: Marta bought five textbooks on sale, for a total of 5 * 10 = $50. Three textbooks from the bookstore had a cost of 3 * 40 = $120.

Answer: 1 roll can wrap 5 shirt boxes and he has 20 shirts boxes to wrap so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 rolls of wrap. 1 roll can wrap 3 XL boxes and he has 12 XL boxes to wrap so he needs 12 / 3 = 4 rolls or wrap.

There are three goldfish and ten platyfish in a fish tank. Each goldfish plays with ten red balls, while each platyfish plays with five white balls. What is the total number of balls in the fish tank? Step-by-step reasoning process: If there are 3 goldfish, and each is playing with ten red balls, then the number of red balls in the tank is 3 * 10 = 30. There are also ten platyfish playing with 5 white balls, there are 10 * 5 = 50 white balls. The total number of red and white balls in the fish tank is 50 + 30 = 80. The answer is 80. Answer the following question. Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students. At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers. She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week. Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week. After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have? Step-by-step reasoning process: After one week, Susy has 100 + 40 = 140 followers. In the second week, Susy gains 40 / 2 = 20 new followers. In the third week, Susy gains 20 / 2 = 10 new followers. In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140 + 20 + 10 = 170 total followers. After one week, Sarah has 50 + 90 = 140 followers. After the second week, Sarah gains 90 / 3 = 30 followers. After the third week, Sarah gains 30 / 3 = 10 followers. So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140 + 30 + 10 = 180 total followers. Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180. The answer is 180. Answer the following question. A bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals? Step-by-step reasoning process: The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = 200 pounds from berries. It gained 2 * 200 = 400 pounds from acorns. It still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds. Thus, it gained 400 / 2 = 200 pounds from salmon. Therefore, the bear gained 400 - 200 = 200 pounds from small animals. The answer is 200. Answer the following question.

It cost $50 to remove the floor. The new floor costs $1.25 per square foot and Tom's room is 8*7 feet. How much did it cost to replace the floor? [Answer]: The room is 8 * 7 = 56 square feet.

The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne? [Answer]: First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts / gallon = 160 quarts. Then multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50 / quart = $8000. Then multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * .2 = $1600. Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $6400. So the answer is 6400.

This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., transfer RNA), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-uracil) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures. In addition, base-pairing between transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) forms the basis for the molecular recognition events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins via the genetic code. Answer this question: what are the base pair rules for rna? # ANSWER The relevant information is: This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., transfer RNA), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-uracil) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures. FINAL ANSWER: Watson - Crick base pairs ( guanine - cytosine and adenine - uracil ) permit the formation of short double - stranded helices , and a wide variety of non-Watson - Crick interactions ( e.g. , G-U or A-A ) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three - dimensional structures # QUESTION Context: Leithart provides a number of parallels between the Philistine captivity of the Ark and the Plagues of Egypt in the Book of Exodus. The ark brings about plagues, humbles the gods of the Philistines and returns full of treasure. In fact, the Philistine diviners refer to the events of the Exodus in 1 Samuel 6: 6. On the advice of these diviners about how to end the plagues, the Philistines made a guilt offering of five golden tumors and five gold mice (representing the five Philistine rulers). They then placed the gold along with the ark on a cart drawn by two milch cows, who head straight for Israel and do not waver. The ark stops at Beth Shemesh before finding a more permanent home at Kiriath-Jearim. Question: where was the ark of the covenant taken? # ANSWER To answer the question, consider the following: The ark stops at Beth Shemesh before finding a more permanent home at Kiriath-Jearim.

She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them? Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. It takes 15 minutes to bake, 30 minutes for the white icing to harden and 30 minutes for the chocolate icing to harden so it takes 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 minutes. Every hour has 60 minutes and it takes her 2 hours so it takes 60 * 2 = 120 minutes to make the cookies. It takes 120 minutes to make the cookies from start to finish and she spends 75 minutes baking and hardening icing so it takes her 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to make the batter and cool the cookies.. The answer is: 45. Bob is building raised beds for his vegetable garden. Each bed is 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 8 feet long. The sides are going to be built of 1-foot wide planks. If Bob buys his lumber in 8-foot-long boards, planning to cut some of them for the shorter lengths he'll need, how many 8-foot long planks will he need to construct 10 raised beds? Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. Each raised bed is 8 feet long, the same as the planks, so the long sides of the beds will each be 1 plank long. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, or 2 / 8 = 1 / 4 the length of the planks, so the short sides will each be 1 / 4 plank long. Each bed is 2 feet tall, and the planks are 1 foot wide, so each side will need 2 pieces of lumber of the same length. So each bed will require 2 * 2 * 1.25 = 4 * 1.25 = 5 planks of wood. Bob wants to build 10 raised beds, so he will need 10 * 5 = 50 planks of lumber.. The answer is: 50. Rick has 130 cards. He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards.

After keeping 15 cards, Rick had 130 cards - 15 cards = 115 cards left. The total number of cards given by Rick to his 8 friends was 8 friends x 12 cards / friend = 96 cards. There were 2 sisters x 3 cards / sister = 6 cards given to Rick's sisters. So, there were 96 cards + 6 cards = 102 cards left after Rick gave Miguel some cards. Therefore, 115 cards - 102 cards = 13 cards were given to Miguel.. The answer is: 13.</span></div></div>

Each experienced sailor was paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors. If the inexperienced sailors were paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek, calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors. Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. If the experienced sailors received 1 / 5 times more money than the inexperienced sailors, they were paid 1 / 5 * 10 = $2 more. The total hourly earnings for the experienced sailors each is $10 + $2 = $12. In a 60 - hour workweek, an experienced sailor is paid 60 * $12 = $720. In a month, an experienced sailor is paid 4 * $720 = $2880. If there were five inexperienced sailors, the total number of experienced sailors was 17 - 5 = 12. If each experienced sailor was paid $2280 per month, the total combined monthly earnings for the experienced is 12 * 2880 = $34560.. The answer is: 34560. Ruby is taking dance lessons.

Give the rationale and then the answer. Let's think step by step. The classes in the pack cost $7.5 each because 75 / 10 = 7.5. An additional class costs $10 because 7.5 x (1 + (1 / 3)) = 10. She buys 3 extra classes because 13 - 10 = 3. Her three additional classes cost $30 because 3 x 10 = 30. Her total cost is $105 because 75 + 30 = 105.. The answer is: 105.

<p>The authors of the Flan Collection recommend experimenting with different mixing ratio's of tasks to get optimal results downstream.</p>
