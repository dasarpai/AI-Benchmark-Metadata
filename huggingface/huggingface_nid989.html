When I glanced out the bus window, the scene was so stunning that I was amazed by the beauty of urban modernization. Unlike my hometown and most of the rural areas of the country, clean city roads,relaxing recreation parks, modern new buildings with unique design and new and well-maintained sidewalks for pedestrians were so alluring to me. At that moment, I started to realize that I have always loved seeing city features such as roads, streets, electricity distribution, public buildings and parks. Suddenly, I began to wonder what if I created these city features I love with my own ideas and hands.This moment made me interested in designing, constructing and maintaining urban infrastructures. Since then, I continually searched for ways to follow my interest and focus on studies about urban engineering, planning and designing. From 2017 to 2020, I studied as a medical student ,a popular and difficult profession, here in Myanmar. However, ever since I knew what my real dream job is, I looked for chances to learn urban planning, building and maintaining professions as much as possible. Nonetheless, unfortunately, there is no such course related to urban engineering studies, even for a short class or diploma, available in my country. But I did not give up on chasing my dreams. I wondered what else I can prepare which can help me if I get a chance to study urban engineering. As the very first exposure to the engineering field, I started to take an architectural introduction short course via virtual classes. Through this course, I got to know what fundamental knowledge and technical skills are needed to design a project. For instance, we need to learn how to use AUTOCAD properly both in architecture and urban engineering.I also have learnt about foundational theories of architecture such as form, space, order, materials used in constructing a project and also how to communicate with clients as well.I am positive that all of the knowledge I gained from this course will help me a lot in my urban engineering studies in the future at Pusan National University. Through this program, I want to enhance my problem-solving skills by seeking, specifying and actually applying desired resolutions to many problems associated with rapid urbanization and population explosion in cities, such as shortage of accommodation, available land, water and drainage issues, traffic issues, and the overpopulation of cities.Since this course provides an opportunity to develop the insights, knowledge and technical skills needed to deal effectively with the challenges of contemporary urban life, I am assured that it will effectively help me to develop myself for becoming a skilled and brilliant urban engineer. Why South Korea? South Korea has innovative and efficient smart cities like Seoul. Early 2020, the World Bank hosted its 3rd Korea Smart City Study Tour, allowing the participants to have a chance to learn from the Korean smart city experience - in smart mobility, smart waste and energy, smart citizenry, and smart public space. For example, Seoul successfully transformed its transportation into smart mobility by introducing its people advanced Intelligent Transport System (ITS) technology and Bus Management System (BMS) in 2003.After that, the share of bus and subway riders bounced back to almost 70% and that of car users remained less than 30%.All of these factors motivated me to study my career,urban engineering, in South Korea. Additionally, Korea has already got me interested with its wonderful culture and entertainment which have made Korea known as the land of Kpop and K-dramas. I started learning Korean about one year ago. I am currently at the end of level 3 class and able to communicate in Korean language fluently on a daily basis.Although I don't have a TOPIK certificate because TOPIK exams were cancelled in the last two years due to pandemic conditions, I am positive that I can obtain TOPIK level 2 and above. Studying Korean passionately will benefit me to be fluent in Korean so that I will not encounter any difficulty in communicating with Korean people. I am very delighted to find this joint scholarship program which encourages me to seek a better education for the purpose of fulfilling my dreams. The knowledge and experience I can get in Korea will be priceless. I believe studying in Korea will enable me to broaden my academic knowledge focusing on urban engineering so that I could implement it in my country and enable my craving to participate in transforming Myanmar cities into more efficient, resilient as well as more livable and enjoyable ones. As interest makes learning easier, I am optimistic that I will become not only an outstanding scholar but also a powerful tool for the world, especially for my local society. After all, this scholarship program will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to learn about the field of study I love as well as serving as a bridge to reach my future goal of building up innovative, inclusive and resilient Myanmar cities which are joyful, relaxing and enjoyable as well.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I never imagined throughout my life that I would finally discover my dream job which I have been searching for a long time while taking a bus.

The first female to head a major production company: the power a changemaker and maverick can impart continues to influence posterity. As Maty Lyon valued women's education and bolstering women, similarly, Lucille Ball would teach and mentor young female comedians. Mount Holyoke continues to embrace the shakers and the non-traditional. I gravitated toward the field of sociology during my two years at Ocean County College since it provides countless ways of looking at society and the numerous avenues you can take with it and lenses you can view the whys and hows of human social relationships and institutions through because of its interdisciplinary nature. When I took Social Problems Fall 2020, it solidified my interest in sociology, especially since I was afforded the opportunity to do my research paper and a presentation on autism in girls (how it often goes undiagnosed and susceptibility to sexual explotiation). I could possibly perform more comprehensive research on it. Or through Mount Holyoke's C.A.U.S.E club, I could do a volunteer project with Autism Connections inolving their sexuality program. One of my favorite aspects to learn about in history are social movements- especially the civil rights movement and the other movements (women, disability, lgbtq+ rights, etc.) it spurred and their interconnectedness and how inequalities surfaced in the 1960s-70s, which I got to explore when I took an America in the 60s class; Collective Behavior and Social Inequality taught by Professor Tucker would allow me to dive deeper into social movements prior and after the 60s. I could potentially do research with Professor Tucker on social movements such as Black Lives Matter and on his project that is exploring the role of women in creating an upper class culture in 19th Century New England. I could take concepts I would learn in sociology classes and the intergroup dialogue courses and become a facilitator of discussions revolving around social justice issues through the Mozone Peer Education Program by participating. I hope to contribute to Moho's mission of fostering inclusivity and belonging and help others find resources to feel part of the community and celebrate their differences;. Discussions in sociology courses can be taken outside the classroom to talk about our identities and their intersections and our experiences to help strengthen community. This program is a great way for advocacy and social justice knowledge and critical thinking skills to grow and evolve. I want to attend a college that emphasizes inclusion and belonging: these values are the hallmark of Mount Holyoke. The Neurodiverse Student Association would be an invaluable safe space and community for me and would provide me with the social and emotional support I am seeking. The AccessAbility fellow would act as guide and would help me adjust to Mount Holyoke. Upon finding my footing, I would hope to become an AccessAbility fellow myself to help incoming students feel like they can thrive. Mount Holyoke offers its students a plethora of opportunities to act as changemakers and it would be a privilege to be a part of it.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mount Holyoke, and its founder Mary Lyon, remind me of Lucille Ball: both pioneers, changemakers, and mavericks. The first female to head a major production company: the power a changemaker and maverick can impart continues to influence posterity. As Many Lyon valued women's education and bolstering women, similarly, Lucille Ball would teach and mentor young female comedians. Mount Holyoke continues to embrace the shakers and the non-traditional. I gravitated toward the field of sociology during my two years at Ocean County College since it provides countless ways of looking at society and the numerous avenues you can take with it and lenses you can view the why's and how's of human social relationships and institutions through because of its interdisciplinary nature.

But I don't say I wasn't in others. I actually found these subjects easy to grasp and understand and yet I didn't realize what I truly want. After entering the college, that is when I learnt what actually choosing a course and a major is. Then all of a sudden my mind shifted from engineering field to medical field. I got more and more interested in medical field. I always found human body as the greatest mystery. Also I had seen accidents, operations and surgeries in my family. My aunt is a doctor and a huge impact was from her since my childhood. Ever since I joined my college she always had a desire that I would join medical. Maybe she saw inside me and my true desire that I have. It's been 2 years since I have realized my true aim an started working towards it. I tired getting some basic information about how actually this field works. The more I started to know about medicine, the more fascinated I was and more determined was my heart and brain to achieve something in medicine. Out of all the parts of our body, brain attracted me the most. I don't know why but I really wanted to study more about brain. I found it more mysterious than anything. And that is when becoming a Neurologist became my ultimate goal. According to me being a doctor means studying all your life. Every surgery, every patient is different and we get to learn from each and everything. Even though becoming neurologist wont stop my urge to move forward, from where I'm seeing right now it is my biggest aim. About studying outside my country, I was always on my toes to go out to different countries and study. I used to do a lot of research about studying not only just in Korea.

I am writing to apply for the scholarship program for Pusan National University offered by Gyeongnam Foreign Residents' Support Center. My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree in French language that would assist me in pursuing a career as a French language instructor. My career vision is to one day be able to provide affordable (or even free) language classes to marginalized communities in my country and to people in any part of the world who can't afford to take a higher level education pertaining to learning a foreign language which would be the main key for their professional development and employability. However, I am certain that if I do not complete my university degree I could never have the opportunity to achieve my career goals as a FLE teacher who is an expert in teaching French as a foreign language. I decided that I will attain a career as a language teacher since my passion has always been assisting others, especially the youths, and trying to improve their quality of life. Therefore, I think that pursuing such a career will provide me the opportunity to help improve the community's educational conditions and learn about their needs. I remember the time I chose French major when I first apply for university entrance. Although French is not as popular as other science or engineering majors in my country, my father encouraged me to choose whatever I wanted to study as a university student. I grew up with his books and basically he was the one who made me familiar with western languages, literature and poetry since my childhood as well. As a child, I think I unconsciously absorbed the idea of learning a foreign language and its aesthetics in many aspects so in my early university years, I fell in love right away with French literature, poetry and of course mainly with its captivating morphosyntax as well. My father passed away in my final year. Like any other daughters, it was a great loss for me as well as for my family. Losing a loved one was never an easy passing-by and I had to take a break in my studies due to financial problems of my family and my mental health during that phase. Remembering what he wanted me to be, somehow I stood up again and managed to pass the B1 level DELF exam which is known as Diploma in French Language Studies last year by my own effort of self-study and the emotional and financial support of my family, including my mother. I hope my father is contented seeing me continue pursuing my dreams if he ever looks us down from heaven. Talking about my previous academic background, it was an intense enthusiastic interest in studies and other activities that benefited my fellow students and the community around the university, for instance, I participated in various academic activities such as volunteering at the international conferences, being the co-founder of university's literature club and so on. My very first volunteer experience started at the International Conference of Language and Humanity which was held by my university in 2020. Since then, my passion for working in a sector which can lead to the development of the society has been strengthened. Being the person responsible of university's literature club and the co-editor of students' newspaper, Courier, I have organized and assisted in club's events, workshops and university students' art exhibitions as well. Hence, I believe that I have expertise teamwork and leadership skills and I suppose that I'd be a good fit for the scholarship program. With my education, I can help the community and the future of youths with integrity and enthusiasm as I value intellectual growth of children in my country, encouraging them to be creative, engaged and lifelong learners. Thus, you're not just helping me get through my bachelor degree; you're improving the quality of life for countless families to come. I was ecstatic when I first saw this scholarship opportunity as I believe that South Korea is an excellent destination for international studies. On the other hand, I am impressed by the fact that South Korea is one of the countries where the international students are welcomed and who continue to realize the tremendous value of international exchange as well as by its bastion of innovation. If selected for this scholarship, I will continue to apply the same diligence to my academic studies as I have to this point, making education and service to others my top priority. I will represent your Korean organization well during my years in university and beyond.

Currently, I am going to finish my study at Le Quy Don High School for the Gifted, majoring in Math in Vung Tau City. Today I am writing this letter to express my strong desire to study at the University of Alberta, Canada. During my time in high school, even though studying in the most competitive school in my province, I was still able to maintain my solid grades. Also, thanks to joining some clubs at my school and a volunteer project relating to conserving the environment, I have gained many experiences along with some useful skills. In grade 12, I took the IELTS test and got an overall band of 7.5. As my graduation time is coming, I have to start thinking about my education in the near future. Studying in developed countries has always been a dream for many students in developing nations, and I'm not an exception; however, finding a suitable destination is a significant problem. Fortunately, after a long time of researching on the Internet, I have found that Canada is my optimal choice due to the following reasons: First of all, Canada has a well-known education system whose degrees are valued around the globe. Secondly, Canada is a multicultural country, which helps international students like me feel close to each other and teaches us the necessary skills to deal with people from various backgrounds. Furthermore, Canada is well-known for its affordable living cost and safety, which are also very important to foreign students. As a result, this is definitely the right country for me to pursue my academic path. Coming to the University of Alberta, one of the top universities in Canada, besides getting an undergraduate degree, I also hope that I can learn all the useful skills that can boost my employment opportunities in the future, as well as expand my relationships with people from all around the world. I chose to study Computer Science as I have always had a great passion for Math and computers since I was in secondary school. In this modern era, technology is the key to every company's success because of its effectiveness and convenience in producing goods and promoting them, which can remarkably increase their income; hence, there are a lot of job opportunities in this area, leading to a large number of applicants for these jobs every year. Holding a valuable degree from one of the best universities in Canada for teaching Computer Science would give me a clear edge over other applicants when I come back to Vietnam to work. In fact, studying Computer Science in Vietnam these days is not a bad idea because now lots of universities have been able to offer more quality programs as well as more modern facilities than in the past; however, their qualifications are clearly not as globally valued as those of Canada. Additionally, lectures in Vietnamese universities still focus more on delivering theoretical rather than practical knowledge, which in my opinion is not always useful for my jobs in the future. Thus, I prefer studying in Canada to studying in Vietnam when it comes to my university education. After graduating, with all of the precious knowledge and experiences gained from my time living and studying at the University of Alberta, I will return to Vietnam to finish my biggest dream, which is to contribute to my country. Besides this reason, as my family is still living in my home country, I need to be back to take care of my parents when they are older as well as to support my younger sister's career. To conclude, in order to reach my life's important goals, I firmly believe studying in Canada would be a solid fÃ­rst step for me since I was convinced by Canada's comprehensive and competitive education, as well as high security and affordable living budget.

I finally had the time to tick a box in my seemingly unending series list. With my feet propped up, coffee, and a sandwich on my left, I am ready to binge-watch the series I promised to watch after finishing the grueling work and spending three sleepless nights preparing for finals. Of course, pulling all-nighters and procrastinating is part of the experience. There's an exquisite simplicity to lying awake late and doing nothing but lounging. Disconnected from reality while on my couch at night, headphones on, and a documentary playing, my thoughts are astray in the darkness. I've spent countless hours on my couch, lost in my thoughts after the last day of finals, seeking consolation in solitude. Relaxing and thinking are almost a must for me; I have a strong desire to understand the principles and events in everything I watch. Our Planet. The documentary that was playing started with somber music, which gave me goosebumps. It tells the story of all kinds of species, big or small, and how their existence is fragile even if they've been here before us. Species that have lived millennia ago were obliterated in a couple of years. The lives that withstood the shifting of the seasons, summer droughts, winter frosts, and autumn storm winds had succumbed to the fleeting human life. After the final episode ended and a few goosebumps later, it gave me a sense of accomplishment. Contentment entails finding a story and deriving beauty from it. It contained amazement which came with a powerful message that changed my perspective and kept me awake for a few minutes longer before going to bed. It made me think how ephemeral human life is, yet the destruction we bring is lasting. I've always enjoyed watching documentaries, but this one about the deteriorating planet sparked a new passion. One may think that the reason is shallow. Just a Netflix show. But it seeped through my bones, and it made me emotional. It made me change. I've begun to use a tote bag for shopping, thinking twice about buying clothes, using soap and shampoo bars, conserving water, and even persuading my Mother to buy and use LED lights. It made me proud that I was doing something for the planet in my way. Most of my clothes are now from \&quot;ukay\&quot; or thrift stores instead of the mall. I became conscious of my actions and how they could affect the earth. Tenth grade came, and so was our first scientific research project. I've convinced my research partners to pursue a topic concerning the environment. After discovering how coconut husk ash could be a cement replacement in concrete because of its silicon content, we decided to go for it. After spending eight months researching and countless visits to the Department of Public Work and Highways, we found that we can only replace at least 2% of cement in concrete. It wasn't revolutionary, but our research got featured in our school's research fair, and we got high grades for the finals, and we were happy. As I've become the Vice President of my painting club, one day, our adviser asked me, \&quot;Flowers na naman?\&quot;. He wondered why the subjects of my paintings were often flora and fauna, far from the messy and unrealistic paintings I submitted before.

When I was in 10th grade, I had a great opportunity to create a documentary film about Rohingya refugees, and this experience was a life-changing moment for me. Through the interaction with them, we learnt about how inhumane persecution influenced Rohingyas harshly; persecution occurring outside Japan, which I had thought of as something distant, felt closer to me. From then, I started wanting to be a person who can raise people's awareness and disseminate the issues. From 11th grade, I chose to learn in the International Baccalaureate (IB) course, and deepen my understanding of global issues from several fields. As case studies in IB Geography, I learned about my current concerned issue, cultural conflicts: extreme cases of ethnic cleansing like the Rohingya crisis, to daily basis conflict like stereotypes and discriminations to foreigners. In today's globalising society, it is inevitable to face cultural conflicts. I believe a mutual understanding of other cultures is one of the solutions for them. Together with experience in 10th grade, my goal was created. To achieve my goal, learning in GLA is essential. First and foremost, under liberal arts education, I can gain the ability to see the bigger picture of a globalised society, which is necessary for my goals. Secondly, I can obtain the skills and knowledge required for my dream, a journalist. From various subjects GLA provides, Media Studies is crucial for me, to learn cultural influences of media and the relationship of media and society comprehensively. I could develop and further my perspectives with other subjects. Thirdly, a highly diverse environment with interactive classes. This environment allows my critical thinking to be cultivated and enhanced, by participating in discussions with a diverse group of students and professors. Lastly, a dual degree program with ANU. Asian, and learning about the rapid growth in a globalising society with experience in 10th grade, I am interested and want to inform mainly about Asian cultures and influences. So studying at ANU, which is leading Asia Pacific Studies, is what I am looking for and will broaden my future career.

I often felt like I lived between two distinct worlds in my childhood. The first was Sun Valley, Idaho, Ernest Hemingway's long-time residence, and America's first ski resort, known for frequent patrons like Bill Gates and the Kennedys. In other words, I attended one of the most well-funded schools, played hockey near the Sun Valley Lodge, and visited my dad as he worked at the local newspaper, The Mountain Express. Meanwhile, every night my dad and I would trek to a second world, Magic. Magic City, Idaho, is a collection of thirty cabins and a single tavern lining the eastern shore of the Magic Reservoir. One must know which unassuming dirt road to take to get there as it isn't visible from the highway. Furthermore, local authorities lacked interest in the village's patrol, aside from a few fires, drownings, and gun-related incidents. Within Magic, our one-room cabin sat upon stilts, supported by a large Cottonwood tree. We didn't have running water in the winter in the early years, and we had an outhouse instead of a bathroom. Therefore, I bathed using a process we christened \&quot;pioneer baths,\&quot; using microwaved bottled water. There was no phone or internet service, but we did have a TV station, courtesy of a finicky antenna. Thus, the older I got, the more I became aware of the polarity between Magic and Sun Valley. My parents battled addiction, mental health, and financial hardship throughout my childhood, and I spent most of my time with my dad. He seemed to prefer the village's seclusion as if it were a defiant alternative to the opulence up north. Magic was a place for him to drink and paint the Rocky Mountains in plein-air. Yet the desire for withdrawal was often a distraction from painful realities and unhealthy behavior. Many residents shared similar struggles as my parents, which regularly led to unpredictable turbulence in our community. Thus, as the singular resident not yet of legal drinking age, I was often alone in a tumultuous environment. Furthermore, my anxiety felt amplified by an inability to contact anyone outside of our tiny world. As a result, the day we finally got internet access has long remained vivid in my memory. This connection felt like it offered a sense of security within unstable seclusion, and it also allowed me to explore my interests independently. All things considered, I learned many valuable lessons in an unconventional setting from my early life. I came to understand common struggles with compassion while also learning to observe, adapt, and problem-solve autonomously. Additionally, I discovered how access to resources like the internet could have a tangible impact on wellbeing. Despite the dysfunction in Magic, I felt a deep sense of community that would later inspire healthier versions of the same value. However, I promptly created an unstable world of my own. I grew resentful toward those around me and began acting out in anger. I lost interest in school and shortly began experimenting with drugs at a young age. What I initially misjudged as harmless fun slowly degenerated into a severe dependence as I entered high school. My behavior grew increasingly harmful, which resulted in legal charges and probation. Yet I remained unwilling to change. Instead, I left Magic, discarded my studies, and prioritized my addiction. The following year deteriorated into a period of demoralization due to my decisions. Eventually, I incurred a final probation violation. My probation officer sat across from me and presented an opportunity dressed as an ultimatum. I was to choose; to seek treatment or serve the suspended sentence in custody. Slouching in a chair across from the officer, I reluctantly agreed to accept the help he offered. It took me a long time to understand that this offer was a privilege often not afforded to many people. Shortly after that, I arrived at the Lifeline youth treatment center in Salt Lake City. For the first few weeks, I fought nearly every step of the way, as I thought this resistance displayed the strength of my will, and my refusal to change would result in my return home. However, a mounting emotion I'd been neglecting was reaching its threshold. In one final attempt at preserving denial, I decided to flee. Admittedly, this resulted in quite a show for my peers as they ate their lunch. Through the cafeteria window, I could be seen engaged in a short-lived pursuit across the front lawn, which abruptly halted as I was swiftly escorted to the ground by a very kind staff member who, peripherally, coached the local junior football team. Hence, while my escape effort was laughable, it was precisely absurd enough for me to come to terms with my present situation. As the football coach generously carried me back inside, the emotional floodgates seemed to open. I spent the rest of my time at Lifeline steadily addressing my past with staff and peers' support. I began to understand my pain as I learned about mental health, trauma, and class and learned how to take a solution-oriented approach when facing challenges. Furthermore, as my peers and I collectively confronted our individual experiences, I came to understand how narrow-minded I'd been in my perspectives. I recognized the privileges that allowed me to benefit in life, for example, race and proximity to wealth in the criminal justice system. I started to grasp how naive I'd been and how much harm my actions had caused. Seemingly for the first time, I learned to take accountability. My time in treatment was far more than getting clean from drugs, as it offered a healthy community experience, and I learned of my responsibilities to myself and those around me. Further, through access to mental health and educational resources at the center, I studied for the GED test and rediscovered fulfillment in learning. Indeed, I graduated rehab when I should have graduated high school, but I left treatment with my GED, a comprehensive set of new skills and perspectives, and after fourteen months, I was ready to set out into a new world. My outcome would have been vastly different if my mother hadn't helped me begin the rest of my life. She picked me up from Lifeline just as she celebrated her third year sober. As a child, my mom endured hardships beyond my comprehension and was suddenly on her own at age thirteen. However, eventually, she would start a successful business founded upon the desire to help others succeed in the beauty industry by sharing the knowledge and skills that helped her rise out of poverty twice, once as a young woman and again, following bankruptcy in 2008. In short, my mother has been my biggest inspiration. She has given me opportunities I would not have had otherwise. After we arrived home, she helped me enroll at a trade school and later pursue a meaningful career. My informal education continued when I was hired as a corporate trainer in a franchise system. Though I was only eighteen, I was fortunate to have mentors willing to dedicate time and effort to share their knowledge with me and entrust me with responsibilities. My first training was to onboard a team at a new salon. Suddenly, I found myself on a plane to Massachusetts, where I'd learn how to rent a car, navigate roundabouts with white knuckles in Boston's traffic, and track expenses before making my debut. I spent hours preparing, so I felt confident teaching the material and supporting teams as salons organized to open. However, I later realized I was often the youngest person in the room, seemingly telling others what to do. Unsurprisingly, resistance from trainees and franchisees often confronted me. Thus, I had many lessons of substance ahead of me in communication, conflict resolution, and leadership best practices. Despite being the trainer, I regularly felt that I was the one who learned the most. Subsequent roles presented different challenges, which continued my education in a non-traditional setting. I learned practical skills such as writing training programs, project management, and business technologies and continued developing problem-solving, creative solutions, strategy development, and implementation tactics. In addition, my work continued to present me with opportunities to refine my communication skills and my approach to leadership. And so, with the support of those around me, I was fortunate to develop critical abilities in a fast-paced, corporate setting. The influence of technology is certainly not unique to me, but I am immensely aware of its impact on my life. I've often relied on software and online resources to expand my horizons, and this theme continued as I started to branch out beyond my job. First, I began to work through open-source projects to learn the basics of web development, which later inspired my interest in different things like the Women in Red wikiproject. Finally, I enrolled in non-credit courses on design and marketing, which ultimately supported my move into a new creative position in my career and later helped me begin my work in freelance illustration. Through this freelancing, I cultivated a vibrant digital community. In addition, I collaborated with some favorite artists and supported non-profit organizations that aimed to help individuals in the criminal justice system. A final call for growth would come through a merger and acquisition, as the company I'd worked for announced it was being sold. I was offered a role within the centralized team, overseeing five national brands, and immediately recognized the opportunity. However, another call from within had steadily grown. I reflected on the challenges I'd faced, the mentorship and community support I received, and the initiative I had taken over the last seven years. I then recalled the lesson my mom had taught me in the value of pursuing meaningful work. In this reflection, my values, interests, skills, and opportunities for growth seemed to coalesce into a new direction. After the merger and acquisition, I successfully worked independently and prepared to seek higher education. I do not see my non-traditional education as a hindrance nor solely as a triumph of individual will. On the contrary, it was a culmination of profound situations that challenged -and more often supported-my growth. From an intense upbringing to a galvanizing career, I believe that my non-traditional experience has prepared me with the tenacity to pursue a rigorous academic study. I am dedicated to learning and pursuing a field where I can be the most effective in helping people; thus, I plan to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and computer-aided graphics and animation, and my ultimate goal is to seek a higher degree program. A degree in Computer Science from Columbia's School of General Studies would be integral to my future. It would also be an honor to learn from educators whose work I admire, such as Steven K. Feiner in the CGUI Lab and Brian Smith and Lydia Chinton, whose respective work in social computation and computational design has been of great interest to me. As a non-traditional student, I would thrive in an environment like that cultivated by Columbia's preeminent, holistic approach to education. In addition, the collective diversity of experiences and the commitment to social justice and wellbeing are profoundly motivating to me. The vibrant student activity opportunities, such as the Girls Who Code group and the Women &amp;amp; Femme Center of Discussion spaces, are essential in what I'm seeking for a well-rounded educational experience. It would be an immense honor to learn from and study alongside the School of General Studies community.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;At the Lifeline youth residential treatment center, a frequent question my peers asked was, \&quot;It's called Magic?\&quot; At first, the simplest description for the isolated community I grew up in was, \&quot;It's an hour south of Sun Valley.\&quot; However, the following fourteen months at Lifeline would teach me how to define my experiences and lay the foundation for a successful career and my pursuit in higher education as a non-traditional student.

It took me a long time to understand that this offer was a privilege often not afforded to many people. Shortly after that, I arrived at the Lifeline youth treatment center in Salt Lake City. For the first few weeks, I fought nearly every step of the way, as I thought this resistance displayed the strength of my will, and my refusal to change would result in my return home. However, a mounting emotion I'd been neglecting was reaching its threshold. In one final attempt at preserving denial, I decided to flee. Admittedly, this resulted in quite a show for my peers as they ate their lunch. Through the cafeteria window, I could be seen engaged in a short-lived pursuit across the front lawn, which abruptly halted as I was swiftly escorted to the ground by a very kind staff member who, peripherally, coached the local junior football team. Hence, while my escape effort was laughable, it was precisely absurd enough for me to come to terms with my present situation. As the football coach generously carried me back inside, the emotional floodgates seemed to open. I spent the rest of my time at Lifeline steadily addressing my past with staff and peers' support. I began to understand my pain as I learned about mental health, trauma, and class and learned how to take a solution-oriented approach when facing challenges. Furthermore, as my peers and I collectively confronted our individual experiences, I came to understand how narrow-minded I'd been in my perspectives. I recognized the privileges that allowed me to benefit in life, for example, race and proximity to wealth in the criminal justice system. I started to grasp how naive I'd been and how much harm my actions had caused. Seemingly for the first time, I learned to take accountability. My time in treatment was far more than getting clean from drugs, as it offered a healthy community experience, and I learned of my responsibilities to myself and those around me. Further, through access to mental health and educational resources at the center, I studied for the GED test and rediscovered fulfillment in learning. Indeed, I graduated rehab when I should have graduated from high school, but I left treatment with my GED, a comprehensive set of new skills and perspectives, and after fourteen months, I was ready to set out into a new world. My outcome would have been vastly different if my mother hadn't helped me begin the rest of my life. She picked me up from Lifeline just as she celebrated her third year sober. As a child, my mom endured hardships beyond my comprehension and was suddenly on her own at age thirteen. However, eventually, she would start a successful business founded upon the desire to help others succeed in the beauty industry by sharing the knowledge and skills that helped her rise out of poverty twice, once as a young woman and again, following bankruptcy in 2008. In short, my mother has been my biggest inspiration. She has given me opportunities I would not have had otherwise. After we arrived home, she helped me enroll at a trade school and later pursue a meaningful career. My informal education continued when I was hired as a corporate trainer in a franchise system. Though I was only eighteen, I was fortunate to have mentors willing to dedicate time and effort to share their knowledge with me and entrust me with responsibilities. My first training was to onboard a team at a new salon. Suddenly, I found myself on a plane to Massachusetts, where I'd learn how to rent a car, navigate roundabouts with white knuckles in Boston's traffic, and track expenses before making my debut. I spent hours preparing, so I felt confident teaching the material and supporting teams as salons organized to open. However, I later realized I was often the youngest person in the room, seemingly telling others what to do. Unsurprisingly, resistance from trainees and franchisees often confronted me. Thus, I had many lessons of substance ahead of me in communication, conflict resolution, and leadership best practices. Despite being the trainer, I regularly felt that I was the one who learned the most. Subsequent roles presented different challenges, which continued my education in a non-traditional setting. I learned practical skills such as writing training programs, project management, and business technologies and continued developing problem-solving, creative solutions, strategy development, and implementation tactics. In addition, my work continued to present me with opportunities to refine my communication skills and my approach to leadership. And so, with the support of those around me, I was fortunate to develop critical abilities in a fast-paced, corporate setting. The influence of technology is certainly not unique to me, but I am immensely aware of its impact on my life. I've often relied on software and online resources to expand my horizons, and this theme continued as I started to branch out beyond my job. First, I began to work through open-source projects to learn the basics of web development, which later inspired my interest in different things like the Women in Red wiki project. Finally, I enrolled in non-credit courses on design and marketing, which ultimately supported my move into a new creative position in my career and later helped me begin my work in freelance illustration. Through this freelancing, I cultivated a vibrant digital community. In addition, I collaborated with some favorite artists and supported non-profit organizations that aimed to help individuals in the criminal justice system. A final call for growth would come through a merger and acquisition, as the company I'd worked for announced it was being sold. I was offered a role within the centralized team, overseeing five national brands, and immediately recognized the opportunity. However, another call from within had steadily grown. I reflected on the challenges I'd faced, the mentorship and community support I received, and the initiative I had taken over the last seven years. I then recalled the lesson my mom had taught me in the value of pursuing meaningful work. In this reflection, my values, interests, skills, and opportunities for growth seemed to coalesce into a new direction. After the merger and acquisition, I successfully worked independently and prepared to seek higher education. I do not see my non-traditional education as a hindrance nor solely as a triumph of individual will. On the contrary, it was a culmination of profound situations that challenged -and more often supported-my growth. From an intense upbringing to a galvanizing career, I believe that my non-traditional experience has prepared me with the tenacity to pursue a rigorous academic study. I am dedicated to learning and pursuing a field where I can be the most effective in helping people; thus, I plan to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and computer-aided graphics and animation, and my ultimate goal is to seek a higher degree program. A degree in Computer Science from Columbia's School of General Studies would be integral to my future. It would also be an honor to learn from educators whose work I admire, such as Steven K. Finer in the CGI Lab and Brian Smith and Lydia Clinton, whose respective work in social computation and computational design has been of great interest to me. As a non-traditional student, I would thrive in an environment like that cultivated by Columbia's preeminent, holistic approach to education. In addition, the collective diversity of experiences and the commitment to social justice and wellbeing are profoundly motivating to me. The vibrant student activity opportunities, such as the Girls Who Code group and the Women camp; Lemme Center of Discussion spaces, are essential in what I'm seeking for a well-rounded educational experience. It would be an immense honor to learn from and study alongside the School of General Studies community.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Cleaned Essay&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To whom it may concern I am writing this letter to you to express my profound interest in a chance to study Economics at a Hungarian university through the aid of the Stipendium Hungaricum (SH) Scholarship. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will give me wings to reach new horizons of knowledge, which I will further use to contribute to my country as a business data analyst. As a child, I was always intrigued by the game Monopoly, spending hours devising strategies to maximize my in-game profit. Back then, every time I played the game, I would imagine myself as a tycoon broadening his empire across the boundaries of the tiny Monopoly map. The bargains, the purchases, and most importantly the calculation of choices from the game has shaped my cognition into that of an economist and motivated me to be the founder of my high school's STEM and entrepreneur club. Thanks to the STEM&amp;amp;E experience, I have earned myself a shot to participate in Vietnam's first ever world-class educational institution - VinUniversity's Write4Change Contest. It was there that I got to write about the digitizing economy and even pitch about the subject for Vietnam's top-tier economists. After the contest, not only was I exposed to a wide range of perspectives from peers and professionals alike, but I have also learned from my predecessors that to venture beyond the hometown shores is the epitome choice to broaden my intellect and provide answers for the everlasting problems of Vietnam's economy. Although I am lucky enough to study in one of the most prestigious universities of Vietnam - the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, I reckon that only studying in another culture can shape and fortify my perspectives, my beliefs about the world. However, my ambition can't drive me away from the reality that my parents are only officers with a low income. It was a blessing when I learned about the educational cooperation program between Vietnam and Hungary, supporting students to apply for the SH scholarship - the perfect opportunity with precise timing. My belief was even further strengthened when I watched the Hungarian team play valiantly against stronger nations during Euro 2020. The atmosphere in Puskas Arena, the ardor from fans everywhere urged me to be part of that wave, part of that country. Regardless of the results from the program, I have always been preparing myself for a life across the seas as it is one of the must-have qualities of a global citizen. That being said, problems regarding self-finance management and language barriers cannot be undermined. Yet those problems urge me to dig deeper, understand more about the country. My primary goals are to have a part-time job and create connections with as many Hungarians as possible, in order to make Hungary my second home. It is during this pandemic that I can observe the weaknesses of my countries' economy most thoroughly. Farmers' products for export are congested at borders due to the lack of a system modern enough to keep track of products' longevity and COVID exposure. Insufficient origin information led to key export products to Europe like catfish and prawns always violating European rules. Problems like that urge me to become a data analyst to improve the system where products' data between authorities and producers can be synchronized within minutes. Relying heavily on exporting products, Hungary is a pioneer model for developing countries when it comes to conducting complex import export systems. Only by obtaining knowledge from those who took the lead will my analyzing and evaluating skills reach full capability and contribute most effectively to my home country. With my determination to show my values, I am confident that you will find my application as a worthwhile investment.

I genuinely believed that I was better than I really am. How wrong and arrogant I was. Out of all the subjects, I liked Japanese the most. So I ended up deciding to study abroad in Japan. I applied for the MEXT scholarship given by the Consulate General of Japan in San Francisco. I remember walking into the building with my chin held high and a smirk on my smug face. \&quot;This'll be easy as hell,\&quot; I thought to myself. I completely bombed the exam. I could not answer a single question on that exam. But the worst part was the interview. I was a nervous wreck, stumbled all over my words, and could not say what I wanted to say.

I was taught humility, and it's a lesson that will stick with me for the rest of my life. I now realize how small and insufficient I really am. There is so much that I must learn and do not know.

But In order to achieve accurate language proficiency and possess in-depth knowledge of culture and language, I decided to enroll in a Korean language course at Global Diction Studio, Gurgaon. Besides completing my Korean Language TOPIK levels 1 and 2, I gained a deeper understanding of Korean culture by taking their cultural classes. The fact that we learn from teaching also means that our knowledge continues to grow, so I became a Korean language tutor at the Multibhashi company and am teaching the students whatever I have learned so far. As a result, my language skills have been polished and I have grown in confidence. Learning and applying concepts in real-life scenarios are two very different concepts, so I tried reaching out to native Koreans using the Conversation Exchange website, to get some real-life experience. There, I made some Korean friends. Though I am not yet ready to converse in Korean fluently, but I am determined to learn the language and my language exchange partners are so kind and willing to assist me with grammar, vocabularies, and speech levels.

Due to this, I consider myself a good English user even though it's my second language. I will continue to practice my English whenever I can, even if I know it is good. I am more interested in reading webtoons and novels, so I am confident it is helping me with my grammar and vocabulary and will have a benefit on my future.

In a small suburban house lived 7-year-old me, interested in Barbie dolls and online dress-up games. I loved the idea of customizing characters, because I had the possibility of giving them new personalities and features. Although, my parents strongly disapproved of this. Focusing on fashion games or dress-up was too 'girly' for boys. You had to grow up and resemble the image of strong iron hearted men that provided for their families. As a little boy, I've always been fond of fashion - there was nothing I wouldn't trade for the satisfaction of clothes. However, convincing my Latino parents to let me pursue fashion-related activities was difficult. Especially for an immigrant family that only wanted me to pursue more basic, well-rounded occupations. From elementary to high school, conforming to normalcy was something I strayed away from. When my peers donned their Canadian red toques and plaid sweatpants, I wore something that looked like it came out of The Matrix. When they laughed, I wore more vibrant colors and odd proportions. When they misunderstood my purpose, I immersed myself more into fashion, analyzing the current collections on Vogue Runway. I disliked how my school lacked individuality and uniqueness. That is, until I found the Advertising and Marketing Communications program at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT). It was a beacon of hope for me; a program that includes fashion and business. I have been working tirelessly ever since. From designing and modeling in my first fashion show in my freshman year to evolving my expansion into digital composition and excelling in courses like Marketing and Communications Technology. I am currently the Vision Head in the United Artists Council. My role consists of having to maintain and craft the vision of the fashion show. The United Artists Council is a collective of seven heads that cultivate a performance show to raise money for a different charity every year. With the last performance able to raise over $3000, this year's charity is the Henry's Foundation; a Canadian-based organization that focuses on de-stigmatizing mental health. I also oversee the heads of design and modeling to make sure their work aligns with the basis of the theme. Currently, the theme I've made for this year's show was to promote the idea of a \&quot;sandbox\&quot;, which is essentially a free terrain of creative expression. Exhibiting themes of inclusivity and diversity, the show will consist of both male and female students of all sizes and colors. I believe I am fully equipped with the required attributes for the challenging and insightful curriculum that the FIT has in-store for me. With over a year's experience as a Customer Care Associate at Leon's Furniture, I have been able to challenge and improve on my problem solving, collaboration, and interpersonal skills. I have also worked on the management side of Leon's - crunching numbers and hitting deadlines. The Advertising and Marketing Communications (AMC) major is for people that want to make a change in the world. I believe being in a competitive environment will inspire me to think deeper into my inventiveness. It will be the inciting force to create new fresh ideas. The curriculum encourages students to work on their business and creative apprehension. The AMC major has classes that are necessary to thrive in the advertising and communication world. From programs like Excel and Photoshop, to workshops in Fashion Journalism and Public Relations, having knowledge in these subjects are crucial to achieve success in this industry. I can appreciate the fact that this program also has professors that are equipped with years of industry experience. This allows them to nurture and hone the skill of any student. FIT is my gateway to success. Known for its diverse student body, notable alumni and faculty, FIT will help me thrive in an industry I am positive I will succeed in. I am aware that New York City is not for the light-hearted and will require a lot of hard-work to get to my desired destination, but I am prepared to take on any challenge FIT has to offer. With my determination and integrity, I hope to one day use fashion as an outlet to inspire young adolescents just like me to follow their goals and aspirations.

With the last performance able to raise over $3000, this year's charity is the Henry's Foundation; a Canadian-based organization that focuses on destigmatizing mental health. I also oversee the heads of design and modeling to make sure their work aligns with the basis of the theme. Currently, the theme I've made for this year's show was to promote the idea of a \&quot;sandbox\&quot;, which is essentially a free terrain of creative expression. Exhibiting themes of inclusivity and diversity, the show will consist of both male and female students of all sizes and colors. I believe I am fully equipped with the required attributes for the challenging and insightful curriculum that the FIT has in-store for me. With over a year's experience as a Customer Care Associate at Leon's Furniture, I have been able to challenge and improve on my problem-solving, collaboration, and interpersonal skills. I have also worked on the management side of Leon's - crunching numbers and hitting deadlines. The Advertising and Marketing Communications (AMC) major is for people that want to make a change in the world. I believe being in a competitive environment will inspire me to think deeper into my inventiveness. It will be the inciting force to create new fresh ideas. The curriculum encourages students to work on their business and creative apprehension. The AMC major has classes that are necessary to thrive in the advertising and communication world. From programs like Excel and Photoshop, to workshops in Fashion Journalism and Public Relations, having knowledge in these subjects are crucial to achieve success in this industry. I can appreciate the fact that this program also has professors that are equipped with years of industry experience. This allows them to nurture and hone the skill of any student. FIT is my gateway to success. Known for its diverse student body, notable alumni and faculty, FIT will help me thrive in an industry I am positive I will succeed in. I am aware that New York City is not for the light-hearted and will require a lot of hard-work to get to my desired destination, but I am prepared to take on any challenge FIT has to offer. With my determination and integrity, I hope to one day use fashion as an outlet to inspire young adolescents just like me to follow their goals and aspirations.

I did tons of research about a bachelor's degree in the Computer Engineering Program of Sejong university, and I strongly believe it would be a perfect match for me since Korea is one of the most technologically advanced countries. Furthermore, the Computer Engineering program at Sejong University provides highly-qualified knowledge through different lectures and team-based projects to equip students with essential skills. Nowadays, technologies surround us everywhere, and their main purpose is to make life easier to live. My passion for technologies started when I was a kid. I still can remember my stunned face when my close friend built for me my first computer. Afterward, he taught me how to use a PC and download different games on my own. He was the person who encouraged me to learn to code even though my family thought that IT was for boys. He taught me how to create websites and online web games. I was doing well until he applied to Kyungbok university and flew to Korea, leaving me alone with obstacles that helped me examine myself and opened the self-study world for me. Finally, when I participated in my first Hackathon, I realized that coding and engineering skills allow me to integrate new technology innovations into our future. After that, I organized a community for girls who desire to make a typical science-fiction future world come true and prove to everyone that girls could be in tech as well as boys. After all, thanks to my friend and my community, I can be sure that nothing better matches me as the Information Technologies field, and majoring in the Computer Engineering program will help fulfill my desire to develop technologies that can improve people's everyday lives.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please help me to correct mistakes.

Being a 12-year-old girl, I was unable to answer and the matter sunk into oblivion. A year later, I sold bubble tea to support a girl with leukaemia, which evoked the question. I realized pho is just a prime example of most domestic products being undervalued, and this is attributable to not only the customer's conditioned assessment but also the seller's business system. In the same year, I had a chance to visit Singapore and was impressed by the unique economic history there. I firmly believe that studying business in the active environment in Singapore, particularly at NUS, would assist me when I hope to exert a certain degree of impact on the development of national products in the home as well as foreign market. Since then, I have tried to enrich my personal experience by participating in some social activities. Starting from high school, I have been the monitor for 3 years and co-led the trading of the mathematics classes in the school's fair twice. Notably, after the interview and probation, I was admitted to Empower Women Asia, national-scale entrepreneurship aimed at supporting ethnic minority children and women, and popularizing cultural values. As a part of it, I learned more vividly about running a professional business, especially marketing and customer service. Also, I major in mathematics, which I believe would be a solid base for further study in business. I got the 3rd prize in the Provincial Mathematical Olympiad, which is proof of my progress after the disorientation in the first year at high school. Yet, the more I experience, the more aware I am of the knowledge, skills, and qualities I need to improve. Once at NUS, I will make the best progress, fulfil my original aspiration, contribute my success to my homeland and also, NUS.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Why does a bowl of pho cost half as much as a cup of bubble tea while it is more nutritious and cooked sophisticated?\&quot; My cousin asked me when we went to a pho restaurant together around 6 years ago.

The Nigeria oil and gas industry provides more than 90% of the country's export and 80% of the government revenue hence the need to optimize production and increase performances across board. As a graduate of Mathematics, i developed a fascination towards data which prompt me to secure a job as a data enter officer; during these period, i have tried to better myself attending online courses on data analysis which has enlightened and broaden my horizon as to the need for data analysts and scientists in all sector for improved performances. This fascination of mine turned passion has fuelled my interest to apply for the Petroleum Technology Development Fund(PTDF) scholarship to obtain a masters (MSc) degree in Data Science at the University of Salford. I am particularly keen to study at the University of Salford because they meet my criteria. Firstly, their methodology of teaching includes 50% of practical projects and 50% examination which will prepare students for real life problem solving skills as a data scientist. Secondly, the course modules include data analytics, data mining, advanced database which I find invaluable to my career development as a data scientist. Lastly, the school has a long standing and existing relationship with Nigerian students to the extent of having an office in Lagos, Nigeria. With data science in the oil and gas industry, recent research shows that data gathered from drilling can be applied to conduct various analyses from scheduling to drilling operations thereby improving drilling performance. Also, in production engineering, big data analytics can optimize the performance of production pumps while it can also manage risks and enhance safety by improving oil and gas occupational safety. From my past experience as a data entry officer, studying data science at the University of Salford will provide me the technical skills needed to predict and guide the nation's oil and gas sector into the future of the industry, if given the chance. The future of oil and gas industry lies with data science and i believe with the right minds, we can move the nation forward. In terms of national development, data science can help predict and utilise majority of the natural gas which is being flared off subsequently enhancing the output of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for the masses. Also, with its predictions, oil production capacity can be optimised, improving the export capacity of the nation as well as increasing the government revenue. Applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence provides oil and gas industry the ability to identify trends and predict events throughout processes which will enable quick response to disruption and improve efficiencies. From PTDF objectives, this scholarship would boost my career development and as the saying goes, \&quot;data is just like crude; it is valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be put to good use\&quot;. I aim to impact the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry through data science in whatever capacity I can when i get back from my postgraduate studies.

Squinting through the eyepiece, I was in disbelief over how sophisticated a supposedly simple tissue could be - cells of many different types carrying out their distinct roles in perfect harmony. It didn't take long for this disbelief to grow into curiosity about the efficient intricacy of the body, driving me to explore bioengineering. I understood that the central theme of this discipline is to use technology to develop treatments for diseases - technology evolves and new diseases are discovered, both on a continuous basis, so bioengineering is an ever-expanding, recession-proof career. I realized I would love to work in a field that allows constant learning. In school, I am particularly keen about Biology. Unlike Math and Chemistry, which are more abstract studies, I find Biology more easily applicable, since it explores the functionality of the body and our interactions with other organisms. Every Biology lesson feels like self-discovery. In Year 12, I had to choose between A Level Math and Biology. After consideration, I opted for Biology, and decided to push myself by studying Math on my own, using online resources to guide me. Studying a two-year course independently enabled me to develop a degree of academic endurance that would benefit me in advanced studies. Also, being my own teacher, I did not need to limit myself and follow a confined syllabus - I also ventured into complex integration, vector mechanics and probability distribution models. Studying A Level Biology built me a framework for deeper studies in biomedicine. The topics cell biology and genetic technology fascinated me the most, and allowed me to build a fundamental understanding of existing and emerging techniques involved in disease diagnosis. In Chemistry and Physics, I enjoyed learning concepts like organic chemistry, electronic circuits, and thermodynamics, and then applying this knowledge in practical classes. During the summer, I undertook a 4-week university-level course on the basics of biomedical engineering, in which I was introduced to the coding programs Arduino and MATLAB, and learned to analyze sensor data using MATLAB code, and then use this to control bionic prosthetics in a closed loop. The course greatly benefited me, as it yielded insight into the programming aspect of the field. Currently, I am working on the Cambridge EPQ (CIPQ), in which I based my research report on the possibility of using CRISPR and RNA splicing to treat cancers more effectively. The report contains information I gathered using a set of research methods, primarily literature reviews (theses and articles on molecular biology). The project allowed me to stretch my learning and thinking abilities and gain an overview of writing university theses. I understand that a real-world engineer must also possess interpersonal skills. Participating and ranking 1st nationally in the IOF Cyber Olympiads boosted my problem-solving skills, and also complemented my A Level studies. My acumen as a leader was sharpened by leading my school's senior student council as Head Boy. I have played club cricket for YTCA's U-16 and U-19 teams in provincial tournaments since 2017. Playing a sport has developed my game and transformed me into a much improved communicator and team worker. I have also been part of AUD Model UN as a delegate, and enjoyed working with other students to propose solutions to global issues. I often volunteer for environmental and charitable programs, including Walks for Education and EEG Cleanup Campaigns. Through this Bachelor of Engineering program, I hope to transform myself into a technically-equipped nano-engineering researcher, and work towards my long-term goal of discovering new medical applications of nanoparticles, a study that can revolutionize the healthcare industry.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;My first experience of viewing cells under a microscope was an examination of a human blood vessel in my AS Biology lab class.

I realized I would love to work in a field that allows constant learning. In school, I am particularly keen about Biology. Unlike Math and Chemistry, which are more abstract studies, I find Biology more easily applicable, since it explores the functionality of the body and our interactions with other organisms. Every Biology lesson feels like self-discovery. In Year 12, I had to choose between A Level Math and Biology. After consideration, I opted for Biology, and decided to push myself by studying Math on my own, using online resources to guide me. Studying a two-year course independently enabled me to develop a degree of academic endurance that would benefit me in advanced studies. Also, being my own teacher, I did not need to limit myself and follow a confined syllabus - I also ventured into complex integration, vector mechanics and probability distribution models. Studying A Level Biology built me a framework for deeper studies in biomedicine. The topics' cell biology and genetic technology fascinated me the most, and allowed me to build a fundamental understanding of existing and emerging techniques involved in disease diagnosis. In Chemistry and Physics, I enjoyed learning concepts like organic chemistry, electronic circuits, and thermodynamics, and then applying this knowledge in practical classes. During the summer, I undertook a 4-week university-level course on the basics of biomedical engineering, in which I was introduced to the coding programs Arduino and MATLAB, and learned to analyze sensor data using MATLAB code, and then use this to control bionic prosthetics in a closed loop. The course greatly benefited me, as it yielded insight into the programming aspect of the field. Currently, I am working on the Cambridge EPP (CIP), in which I based my research report on the possibility of using CRISPR and RNA splicing to treat cancers more effectively. The report contains information I gathered using a set of research methods, primarily literature reviews (theses and articles on molecular biology). The project allowed me to stretch my learning and thinking abilities and gain an overview of writing university theses. I understand that a real-world engineer must also possess interpersonal skills. Participating and ranking 1st nationally in the IOF Cyber Olympiads boosted my problem-solving skills, and also complemented my A Level studies. My acumen as a leader was sharpened by leading my school's senior student council as Head Boy. I have played club cricket for YMCA's U-16 and U-19 teams in provincial tournaments since 2017. Playing a sport has developed my game and transformed me into a much improved communicator and team worker. I have also been part of AUD Model UN as a delegate, and enjoyed working with other students to propose solutions to global issues. I often volunteer for environmental and charitable programs, including Walks for Education and EEG Cleanup Campaigns. Through this Bachelor of Engineering program, I hope to transform myself into a technically-equipped nano-engineering researcher, and work towards my long-term goal of discovering new medical applications of nanoparticles, a study that can revolutionize the healthcare industry.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Cleaned Essay&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The two values that I try to uphold everyday are understanding and introspection. When I immigrated to Canada as a kid, I tended to stay quiet and observe how people acted. The main reason for this was because English was my second language. When I had trouble interpreting English, I turned to non-verbal cues as a way to understand people, such as their tone, body language, and etc. As I've matured and started working, this skill has come in handy with day to day interactions. Whoever I meet I try to be as understanding as possible and make the effort to learn their boundaries. I try to learn what my coworkers' working styles are and adjust as such. Making these small efforts not only makes the interactions I have with people easier, but it also makes for faster conflict resolutions. As I've gotten older, I've turned this skill of understanding others onto myself. Personal introspection is the best way to identify personal problems, weaknesses, and strengths. During the time I got an academic probation, I took some time and self reflected on what I needed to do to succeed. So, I developed a plan to help me succeed. Whenever I feel stuck, I always refer back to my introspections to see the bigger picture. I look back at my mistakes and try to avoid them. Understanding how others become successful and understanding how I can succeed helped me during my personal development and ultimately helped me accomplish my proudest achievement of finishing my diploma.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The two values that I try to uphold every day are understanding and introspection.

I was touched by how consistency could be a form of inspiration to people around me, so I brought this trait to bigger things in life such as leading the Charity Art Club with consistent effort rather than bursting all my passion at once. I am proud that my \&quot;consistency\&quot; is not just integrated with the small stuff, but also allowing me to take on greater responsibilities. Now as a senior, I know exactly how underclassmen with acne feel, which always motivates me to reach out. I would observe and help in different approaches. For example, while some people might be looking for skincare advice, others might feel uncomfortable discussing it. As situations demanded, I adapted. Sometimes, I would provide a detailed plan for my sister; I would stand up for the freshman who got taunted. Other times, by simply showing my worst acne picture or making sure to not bring up acne topics to the table would make my friends with acne feel better. In my community, I am often described as a detailed oriented, consistent and an empathetic person, at UBC, I strive to embrace these traits as well as learning from people around me.&quot;},&quot;Correct Grammar&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;One thing essential to know about me is acne, but it's not the acne I am proud of, rather, it's the qualities I learned from acne experience that later became a part of me.

When I glanced out the bus window, the scene was so stunning that I was amazed by the beauty of urban modernization. Unlike my hometown and most of the rural areas of the country, clean city roads,relaxing recreation parks, modern new buildings with unique design and new and well-maintained sidewalks for pedestrians were so alluring to me. At that moment, I started to realize that I have always loved seeing city features such as roads, streets, electricity distribution, public buildings and parks. Suddenly, I began to wonder what if I created these city features I love with my own ideas and hands.This moment made me interested in designing, constructing and maintaining urban infrastructures. Since then, I continually searched for ways to follow my interest and focus on studies about urban engineering, planning and designing. From 2017 to 2020, I studied as a medical student ,a popular and difficult profession, here in Myanmar. However, ever since I knew what my real dream job is, I looked for chances to learn urban planning, building and maintaining professions as much as possible. Nonetheless, unfortunately, there is no such course related to urban engineering studies, even for a short class or diploma, available in my country. But I did not give up on chasing my dreams. I wondered what else I can prepare which can help me if I get a chance to study urban engineering. As the very first exposure to the engineering field, I started to take an architectural introduction short course via virtual classes. Through this course, I got to know what fundamental knowledge and technical skills are needed to design a project. For instance, we need to learn how to use AUTOCAD properly both in architecture and urban engineering.I also have learnt about foundational theories of architecture such as form, space, order, materials used in constructing a project and also how to communicate with clients as well.I am positive that all of the knowledge I gained from this course will help me a lot in my urban engineering studies in the future at Pusan National University. Through this program, I want to enhance my problem-solving skills by seeking, specifying and actually applying desired resolutions to many problems associated with rapid urbanization and population explosion in cities, such as shortage of accommodation, available land, water and drainage issues, traffic issues, and the overpopulation of cities.Since this course provides an opportunity to develop the insights, knowledge and technical skills needed to deal effectively with the challenges of contemporary urban life, I am assured that it will effectively help me to develop myself for becoming a skilled and brilliant urban engineer. Why South Korea? South Korea has innovative and efficient smart cities like Seoul. Early 2020, the World Bank hosted its 3rd Korea Smart City Study Tour, allowing the participants to have a chance to learn from the Korean smart city experience - in smart mobility, smart waste and energy, smart citizenry, and smart public space. For example, Seoul successfully transformed its transportation into smart mobility by introducing its people advanced Intelligent Transport System (ITS) technology and Bus Management System (BMS) in 2003.After that, the share of bus and subway riders bounced back to almost 70% and that of car users remained less than 30%.All of these factors motivated me to study my career,urban engineering, in South Korea. Additionally, Korea has already got me interested with its wonderful culture and entertainment which have made Korea known as the land of Kpop and K-dramas. I started learning Korean about one year ago. I am currently at the end of level 3 class and able to communicate in Korean language fluently on a daily basis.Although I don't have a TOPIK certificate because TOPIK exams were cancelled in the last two years due to pandemic conditions, I am positive that I can obtain TOPIK level 2 and above. Studying Korean passionately will benefit me to be fluent in Korean so that I will not encounter any difficulty in communicating with Korean people. I am very delighted to find this joint scholarship program which encourages me to seek a better education for the purpose of fulfilling my dreams. The knowledge and experience I can get in Korea will be priceless. I believe studying in Korea will enable me to broaden my academic knowledge focusing on urban engineering so that I could implement it in my country and enable my craving to participate in transforming Myanmar cities into more efficient, resilient as well as more livable and enjoyable ones. As interest makes learning easier, I am optimistic that I will become not only an outstanding scholar but also a powerful tool for the world, especially for my local society. After all, this scholarship program will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to learn about the field of study I love as well as serving as a bridge to reach my future goal of building up innovative, inclusive and resilient Myanmar cities which are joyful, relaxing and enjoyable as well.</span></div></div>

I am writing to apply for the scholarship program for Pusan National University offered by Gyeongnam Foreign Residents' Support Center. My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree in French language that would assist me in pursuing a career as a French language instructor. My career vision is to one day be able to provide affordable (or even free) language classes to marginalized communities in my country and to people in any part of the world who can't afford to take a higher level education pertaining to learning a foreign language which would be the main key for their professional development and employability. However, I am certain that if I do not complete my university degree I could never have the opportunity to achieve my career goals as a FLE teacher who is an expert in teaching French as a foreign language. I decided that I will attain a career as a language teacher since my passion has always been assisting others, especially the youths, and trying to improve their quality of life. Therefore, I think that pursuing such a career will provide me the opportunity to help improve the community's educational conditions and learn about their needs. I remember the time I chose French major when I first apply for university entrance. Although French is not as popular as other science or engineering majors in my country, my father encouraged me to choose whatever I wanted to study as a university student. I grew up with his books and basically he was the one who made me familiar with western languages, literature and poetry since my childhood as well. As a child, I think I unconsciously absorbed the idea of learning a foreign language and its aesthetics in many aspects so in my early university years, I fell in love right away with French literature, poetry and of course mainly with its captivating morphosyntax as well. My father passed away in my final year. Like any other daughters, it was a great loss for me as well as for my family. Losing a loved one was never an easy passing-by and I had to take a break in my studies due to financial problems of my family and my mental health during that phase. Remembering what he wanted me to be, somehow I stood up again and managed to pass the B1 level DELF exam which is known as Diploma in French Language Studies last year by my own effort of self-study and the emotional and financial support of my family, including my mother. I hope my father is contented seeing me continue pursuing my dreams if he ever looks us down from heaven. Talking about my previous academic background, it was an intense enthusiastic interest in studies and other activities that benefited my fellow students and the community around the university, for instance, I participated in various academic activities such as volunteering at the international conferences, being the co-founder of university's literature club and so on. My very first volunteer experience started at the International Conference of Language and Humanity which was held by my university in 2020. Since then, my passion for working in a sector which can lead to the development of the society has been strengthened. Being the person responsible of university's literature club and the co-editor of students' newspaper, Courier, I have organized and assisted in club's events, workshops and university students' art exhibitions as well. Hence, I believe that I have expertise teamwork and leadership skills and I suppose that I'd be a good fit for the scholarship program. With my education, I can help the community and the future of youths with integrity and enthusiasm as I value intellectual growth of children in my country, encouraging them to be creative, engaged and lifelong learners. Thus, you're not just helping me get through my bachelor degree; you're improving the quality of life for countless families to come. I was ecstatic when I first saw this scholarship opportunity as I believe that South Korea is an excellent destination for international studies. On the other hand, I am impressed by the fact that South Korea is one of the countries where the international students are welcomed and who continue to realize the tremendous value of international exchange as well as by its bastion of innovation. If selected for this scholarship, I will continue to apply the same diligence to my academic studies as I have to this point, making education and service to others my top priority. I will represent your Korean organization well during my years in university and beyond. Thank you in advance for your consideration.</span></div></div>

I am writing to apply for the scholarship program for Pusan National University offered by Gangnam Foreign Residents' Support Center. My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree in French language that would assist me in pursuing a career as a French language instructor. My career vision is to one day be able to provide affordable (or even free) language classes to marginalized communities in my country and to people in any part of the world who can't afford to take a higher level education pertaining to learning a foreign language which would be the main key for their professional development and employability. However, I am certain that if I do not complete my university degree I could never have the opportunity to achieve my career goals as an FLE teacher who is an expert in teaching French as a foreign language. I decided that I will attain a career as a language teacher since my passion has always been assisting others, especially the youths, and trying to improve their quality of life. Therefore, I think that pursuing such a career will provide me the opportunity to help improve the community's educational conditions and learn about their needs.

Currently, I am going to finish my study at Le Quy Don High School for the Gifted, majoring in Math in Vung Tau City. Today I am writing this letter to express my strong desire to study at the University of Alberta, Canada. During my time in high school, even though studying in the most competitive school in my province, I was still able to maintain my solid grades. Also, thanks to joining some clubs at my school and a volunteer project relating to conserving the environment, I have gained many experiences along with some useful skills. In grade 12, I took the IELTS test and got an overall band of 7.5. As my graduation time is coming, I have to start thinking about my education in the near future. Studying in developed countries has always been a dream for many students in developing nations, and I'm not an exception; however, finding a suitable destination is a significant problem. Fortunately, after a long time of researching on the Internet, I have found that Canada is my optimal choice due to the following reasons: First of all, Canada has a well-known education system whose degrees are valued around the globe. Secondly, Canada is a multicultural country, which helps international students like me feel close to each other and teaches us the necessary skills to deal with people from various backgrounds. Furthermore, Canada is well-known for its affordable living cost and safety, which are also very important to foreign students. As a result, this is definitely the right country for me to pursue my academic path. Coming to the University of Alberta, one of the top universities in Canada, besides getting an undergraduate degree, I also hope that I can learn all the useful skills that can boost my employment opportunities in the future, as well as expand my relationships with people from all around the world. I chose to study Computer Science as I have always had a great passion for Math and computers since I was in secondary school. In this modern era, technology is the key to every company's success because of its effectiveness and convenience in producing goods and promoting them, which can remarkably increase their income; hence, there are a lot of job opportunities in this area, leading to a large number of applicants for these jobs every year. Holding a valuable degree from one of the best universities in Canada for teaching Computer Science would give me a clear edge over other applicants when I come back to Vietnam to work. In fact, studying Computer Science in Vietnam these days is not a bad idea because now lots of universities have been able to offer more quality programs as well as more modern facilities than in the past; however, their qualifications are clearly not as globally valued as those of Canada. Additionally, lectures in Vietnamese universities still focus more on delivering theoretical rather than practical knowledge, which in my opinion is not always useful for my jobs in the future. Thus, I prefer studying in Canada to studying in Vietnam when it comes to my university education. After graduating, with all of the precious knowledge and experiences gained from my time living and studying at the University of Alberta, I will return to Vietnam to finish my biggest dream, which is to contribute to my country. Besides this reason, as my family is still living in my home country, I need to be back to take care of my parents when they are older as well as to support my younger sister's career. To conclude, in order to reach my life's important goals, I firmly believe studying in Canada would be a solid fÃ­rst step for me since I was convinced by Canada's comprehensive and competitive education, as well as high security and affordable living budget. Finally, I am very grateful that you have spent your time reading my study plan, and I really hope that you can help me to move one step closer to my dream by accepting my application. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,Pham Quang Nghi.</span></div></div>

Relaxing and thinking are almost a must for me; I have a strong desire to understand the principles and events in everything I watch. Our Planet. The documentary that was playing started with somber music, which gave me goosebumps. It tells the story of all kinds of species, big or small, and how their existence is fragile even if they've been here before us. Species that have lived millennia ago were obliterated in a couple of years. The lives that withstood the shifting of the seasons, summer droughts, winter frosts, and autumn storm winds had succumbed to the fleeting human life. After the final episode ended and a few goosebumps later, it gave me a sense of accomplishment. Contentment entails finding a story and deriving beauty from it. It contained amazement which came with a powerful message that changed my perspective and kept me awake for a few minutes longer before going to bed. It made me think how ephemeral human life is, yet the destruction we bring is lasting. I've always enjoyed watching documentaries, but this one about the deteriorating planet sparked a new passion. One may think that the reason is shallow. Just a Netflix show. But it seeped through my bones, and it made me emotional. It made me change. I've begun to use a tote bag for shopping, thinking twice about buying clothes, using soap and shampoo bars, conserving water, and even persuading my Mother to buy and use LED lights. It made me proud that I was doing something for the planet in my way. Most of my clothes are now from "ukay" or thrift stores instead of the mall. I became conscious of my actions and how they could affect the earth. Tenth grade came, and so was our first scientific research project. I've convinced my research partners to pursue a topic concerning the environment. After discovering how coconut husk ash could be a cement replacement in concrete because of its silicon content, we decided to go for it. After spending eight months researching and countless visits to the Department of Public Work and Highways, we found that we can only replace at least 2% of cement in concrete. It wasn't revolutionary, but our research got featured in our school's research fair, and we got high grades for the finals, and we were happy. As I've become the Vice President of my painting club, one day, our adviser asked me, "Flowers na naman?". He wondered why the subjects of my paintings were often flora and fauna, far from the messy and unrealistic paintings I submitted before. I told him that I finally found a muse - the planet.</span></div></div>

In today's globalising society, it is inevitable to face cultural conflicts. I believe a mutual understanding of other cultures is one of the solutions for them. Together with experience in 10th grade, my goal was created. To achieve my goal, learning in GLA is essential. First and foremost, under liberal arts education, I can gain the ability to see the bigger picture of a globalised society, which is necessary for my goals. Secondly, I can obtain the skills and knowledge required for my dream, a journalist. From various subjects GLA provides, Media Studies is crucial for me, to learn cultural influences of media and the relationship of media and society comprehensively. I could develop and further my perspectives with other subjects. Thirdly, a highly diverse environment with interactive classes. This environment allows my critical thinking to be cultivated and enhanced, by participating in discussions with a diverse group of students and professors. Lastly, a dual degree program with ANU.

So studying at ANU, which is leading Asia Pacific Studies, is what I am looking for and will broaden my future career. Thus, GLA will help me grow not only in terms of studying but also as a global citizen and a representative of Asia, and be steps towards my goal.</span></div></div>

At first, the simplest description for the isolated community I grew up in was, "It's an hour south of Sun Valley." However, the following fourteen months at Lifeline would teach me how to define my experiences and lay the foundation for a successful career and my pursuit in higher education as a non-traditional student. I often felt like I lived between two distinct worlds in my childhood. The first was Sun Valley, Idaho, Ernest Hemingway's long-time residence, and America's first ski resort, known for frequent patrons like Bill Gates and the Kennedys. In other words, I attended one of the most well-funded schools, played hockey near the Sun Valley Lodge, and visited my dad as he worked at the local newspaper, The Mountain Express. Meanwhile, every night my dad and I would trek to a second world, Magic. Magic City, Idaho, is a collection of thirty cabins and a single tavern lining the eastern shore of the Magic Reservoir. One must know which unassuming dirt road to take to get there as it isn't visible from the highway. Furthermore, local authorities lacked interest in the village's patrol, aside from a few fires, drownings, and gun-related incidents. Within Magic, our one-room cabin sat upon stilts, supported by a large Cottonwood tree. We didn't have running water in the winter in the early years, and we had an outhouse instead of a bathroom. Therefore, I bathed using a process we christened "pioneer baths," using microwaved bottled water. There was no phone or internet service, but we did have a TV station, courtesy of a finicky antenna. Thus, the older I got, the more I became aware of the polarity between Magic and Sun Valley. My parents battled addiction, mental health, and financial hardship throughout my childhood, and I spent most of my time with my dad. He seemed to prefer the village's seclusion as if it were a defiant alternative to the opulence up north. Magic was a place for him to drink and paint the Rocky Mountains in plein-air. Yet the desire for withdrawal was often a distraction from painful realities and unhealthy behavior. Many residents shared similar struggles as my parents, which regularly led to unpredictable turbulence in our community. Thus, as the singular resident not yet of legal drinking age, I was often alone in a tumultuous environment. Furthermore, my anxiety felt amplified by an inability to contact anyone outside of our tiny world. As a result, the day we finally got internet access has long remained vivid in my memory. This connection felt like it offered a sense of security within unstable seclusion, and it also allowed me to explore my interests independently. All things considered, I learned many valuable lessons in an unconventional setting from my early life. I came to understand common struggles with compassion while also learning to observe, adapt, and problem-solve autonomously. Additionally, I discovered how access to resources like the internet could have a tangible impact on wellbeing. Despite the dysfunction in Magic, I felt a deep sense of community that would later inspire healthier versions of the same value. However, I promptly created an unstable world of my own. I grew resentful toward those around me and began acting out in anger. I lost interest in school and shortly began experimenting with drugs at a young age. What I initially misjudged as harmless fun slowly degenerated into a severe dependence as I entered high school. My behavior grew increasingly harmful, which resulted in legal charges and probation. Yet I remained unwilling to change. Instead, I left Magic, discarded my studies, and prioritized my addiction. The following year deteriorated into a period of demoralization due to my decisions. Eventually, I incurred a final probation violation. My probation officer sat across from me and presented an opportunity dressed as an ultimatum. I was to choose; to seek treatment or serve the suspended sentence in custody. Slouching in a chair across from the officer, I reluctantly agreed to accept the help he offered. It took me a long time to understand that this offer was a privilege often not afforded to many people. Shortly after that, I arrived at the Lifeline youth treatment center in Salt Lake City. For the first few weeks, I fought nearly every step of the way, as I thought this resistance displayed the strength of my will, and my refusal to change would result in my return home. However, a mounting emotion I'd been neglecting was reaching its threshold. In one final attempt at preserving denial, I decided to flee. Admittedly, this resulted in quite a show for my peers as they ate their lunch. Through the cafeteria window, I could be seen engaged in a short-lived pursuit across the front lawn, which abruptly halted as I was swiftly escorted to the ground by a very kind staff member who, peripherally, coached the local junior football team. Hence, while my escape effort was laughable, it was precisely absurd enough for me to come to terms with my present situation. As the football coach generously carried me back inside, the emotional floodgates seemed to open. I spent the rest of my time at Lifeline steadily addressing my past with staff and peers' support. I began to understand my pain as I learned about mental health, trauma, and class and learned how to take a solution-oriented approach when facing challenges. Furthermore, as my peers and I collectively confronted our individual experiences, I came to understand how narrow-minded I'd been in my perspectives. I recognized the privileges that allowed me to benefit in life, for example, race and proximity to wealth in the criminal justice system. I started to grasp how naive I'd been and how much harm my actions had caused. Seemingly for the first time, I learned to take accountability. My time in treatment was far more than getting clean from drugs, as it offered a healthy community experience, and I learned of my responsibilities to myself and those around me. Further, through access to mental health and educational resources at the center, I studied for the GED test and rediscovered fulfillment in learning. Indeed, I graduated rehab when I should have graduated high school, but I left treatment with my GED, a comprehensive set of new skills and perspectives, and after fourteen months, I was ready to set out into a new world. My outcome would have been vastly different if my mother hadn't helped me begin the rest of my life. She picked me up from Lifeline just as she celebrated her third year sober. As a child, my mom endured hardships beyond my comprehension and was suddenly on her own at age thirteen. However, eventually, she would start a successful business founded upon the desire to help others succeed in the beauty industry by sharing the knowledge and skills that helped her rise out of poverty twice, once as a young woman and again, following bankruptcy in 2008. In short, my mother has been my biggest inspiration. She has given me opportunities I would not have had otherwise. After we arrived home, she helped me enroll at a trade school and later pursue a meaningful career. My informal education continued when I was hired as a corporate trainer in a franchise system. Though I was only eighteen, I was fortunate to have mentors willing to dedicate time and effort to share their knowledge with me and entrust me with responsibilities. My first training was to onboard a team at a new salon. Suddenly, I found myself on a plane to Massachusetts, where I'd learn how to rent a car, navigate roundabouts with white knuckles in Boston's traffic, and track expenses before making my debut. I spent hours preparing, so I felt confident teaching the material and supporting teams as salons organized to open. However, I later realized I was often the youngest person in the room, seemingly telling others what to do. Unsurprisingly, resistance from trainees and franchisees often confronted me. Thus, I had many lessons of substance ahead of me in communication, conflict resolution, and leadership best practices. Despite being the trainer, I regularly felt that I was the one who learned the most. Subsequent roles presented different challenges, which continued my education in a non-traditional setting. I learned practical skills such as writing training programs, project management, and business technologies and continued developing problem-solving, creative solutions, strategy development, and implementation tactics. In addition, my work continued to present me with opportunities to refine my communication skills and my approach to leadership. And so, with the support of those around me, I was fortunate to develop critical abilities in a fast-paced, corporate setting. The influence of technology is certainly not unique to me, but I am immensely aware of its impact on my life. I've often relied on software and online resources to expand my horizons, and this theme continued as I started to branch out beyond my job. First, I began to work through open-source projects to learn the basics of web development, which later inspired my interest in different things like the Women in Red wikiproject. Finally, I enrolled in non-credit courses on design and marketing, which ultimately supported my move into a new creative position in my career and later helped me begin my work in freelance illustration. Through this freelancing, I cultivated a vibrant digital community. In addition, I collaborated with some favorite artists and supported non-profit organizations that aimed to help individuals in the criminal justice system. A final call for growth would come through a merger and acquisition, as the company I'd worked for announced it was being sold. I was offered a role within the centralized team, overseeing five national brands, and immediately recognized the opportunity. However, another call from within had steadily grown. I reflected on the challenges I'd faced, the mentorship and community support I received, and the initiative I had taken over the last seven years. I then recalled the lesson my mom had taught me in the value of pursuing meaningful work. In this reflection, my values, interests, skills, and opportunities for growth seemed to coalesce into a new direction. After the merger and acquisition, I successfully worked independently and prepared to seek higher education. I do not see my non-traditional education as a hindrance nor solely as a triumph of individual will. On the contrary, it was a culmination of profound situations that challenged -and more often supported-my growth. From an intense upbringing to a galvanizing career, I believe that my non-traditional experience has prepared me with the tenacity to pursue a rigorous academic study. I am dedicated to learning and pursuing a field where I can be the most effective in helping people; thus, I plan to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and computer-aided graphics and animation, and my ultimate goal is to seek a higher degree program. A degree in Computer Science from Columbia's School of General Studies would be integral to my future. It would also be an honor to learn from educators whose work I admire, such as Steven K. Feiner in the CGUI Lab and Brian Smith and Lydia Chinton, whose respective work in social computation and computational design has been of great interest to me. As a non-traditional student, I would thrive in an environment like that cultivated by Columbia's preeminent, holistic approach to education. In addition, the collective diversity of experiences and the commitment to social justice and wellbeing are profoundly motivating to me. The vibrant student activity opportunities, such as the Girls Who Code group and the Women &amp;amp; Femme Center of Discussion spaces, are essential in what I'm seeking for a well-rounded educational experience. It would be an immense honor to learn from and study alongside the School of General Studies community.</span></div></div>

This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will give me wings to reach new horizons of knowledge, which I will further use to contribute to my country as a business data analyst. As a child, I was always intrigued by the game Monopoly, spending hours devising strategies to maximize my in-game profit. Back then, every time I played the game, I would imagine myself as a tycoon broadening his empire across the boundaries of the tiny Monopoly map. The bargains, the purchases, and most importantly the calculation of choices from the game has shaped my cognition into that of an economist and motivated me to be the founder of my high school's STEM and entrepreneur club. Thanks to the STEM&amp;amp;E experience, I have earned myself a shot to participate in Vietnam's first ever world-class educational institution - VinUniversity's Write4Change Contest. It was there that I got to write about the digitizing economy and even pitch about the subject for Vietnam's top-tier economists. After the contest, not only was I exposed to a wide range of perspectives from peers and professionals alike, but I have also learned from my predecessors that to venture beyond the hometown shores is the epitome choice to broaden my intellect and provide answers for the everlasting problems of Vietnam's economy. Although I am lucky enough to study in one of the most prestigious universities of Vietnam - the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, I reckon that only studying in another culture can shape and fortify my perspectives, my beliefs about the world. However, my ambition can't drive me away from the reality that my parents are only officers with a low income. It was a blessing when I learned about the educational cooperation program between Vietnam and Hungary, supporting students to apply for the SH scholarship - the perfect opportunity with precise timing. My belief was even further strengthened when I watched the Hungarian team play valiantly against stronger nations during Euro 2020. The atmosphere in Puskas Arena, the ardor from fans everywhere urged me to be part of that wave, part of that country. Regardless of the results from the program, I have always been preparing myself for a life across the seas as it is one of the must-have qualities of a global citizen. That being said, problems regarding self-finance management and language barriers cannot be undermined. Yet those problems urge me to dig deeper, understand more about the country. My primary goals are to have a part-time job and create connections with as many Hungarians as possible, in order to make Hungary my second home. It is during this pandemic that I can observe the weaknesses of my countries' economy most thoroughly. Farmers' products for export are congested at borders due to the lack of a system modern enough to keep track of products' longevity and COVID exposure. Insufficient origin information led to key export products to Europe like catfish and prawns always violating European rules. Problems like that urge me to become a data analyst to improve the system where products' data between authorities and producers can be synchronized within minutes. Relying heavily on exporting products, Hungary is a pioneer model for developing countries when it comes to conducting complex import export systems. Only by obtaining knowledge from those who took the lead will my analyzing and evaluating skills reach full capability and contribute most effectively to my home country. With my determination to show my values, I am confident that you will find my application as a worthwhile investment. My excitement about what the future has in store has never depleted, and the scholarship opportunity will set foot for greater things for me to achieve. Yours faithfully</span></div></div>

But In order to achieve accurate language proficiency and possess in-depth knowledge of culture and language, I decided to enroll in a Korean language course at Global Diction Studio, Gurgaon. Besides completing my Korean Language TOPIK levels 1 and 2, I gained a deeper understanding of Korean culture by taking their cultural classes. The fact that we learn from teaching also means that our knowledge continues to grow, so I became a Korean language tutor at the Multibhashi company and am teaching the students whatever I have learned so far. As a result, my language skills have been polished and I have grown in confidence. Learning and applying concepts in real-life scenarios are two very different concepts, so I tried reaching out to native Koreans using the Conversation Exchange website, to get some real-life experience. There, I made some Korean friends. Though I am not yet ready to converse in Korean fluently, but I am determined to learn the language and my language exchange partners are so kind and willing to assist me with grammar, vocabularies, and speech levels. I am also helping them with English. My English has always been practiced through written and oral tests since I was in elementary school. Due to this, I consider myself a good English user even though it's my second language. I will continue to practice my English whenever I can, even if I know it is good. I am more interested in reading webtoons and novels, so I am confident it is helping me with my grammar and vocabulary and will have a benefit on my future. When it comes to speaking, I have always been interested in music, specifically singing, so whenever I sing, I make sure that I'm pronouncing the words correctly.

After coming to Korea:-After arriving in Korea, I would dedicate my first year to studying the Korean language and culture. I plan to spend my winter and summer vacation of the language year to travel around Korea and learn more about the country's culture while participating in community works. Although I have started learning Hangul a few months back still I have a lot of things to learn and explore which is why I will make sure to participate in every cultural activity and event available. I will also do one-on-one language exchange with my Korean friends that I have made and Also I will look if the university, where I will study provides, Korean Buddy program to do one on one language exchange with a Korean student. I will listen to songs and "Sebasi Talk"(related to science) which help me in learning new and useful vocabularies. Additionally, I will also put into practice all the learning I will acquire during the year of language training. I will ensure to spend all my time in learning Korean vocabularies and Phrases as it is essential as I enter the academic year. My aim is to get the TOPIK 4 score or higher. After acquiring my TOPIK score I will begin preparing for the academic year by pre-reading the materials of the course and research articles in English as well as in Korean while I adjusting myself for a more academic professional environment.</span></div></div>

In a small suburban house lived 7-year-old me, interested in Barbie dolls and online dress-up games. I loved the idea of customizing characters, because I had the possibility of giving them new personalities and features. Although, my parents strongly disapproved of this. Focusing on fashion games or dress-up was too 'girly' for boys. You had to grow up and resemble the image of strong iron hearted men that provided for their families. As a little boy, I've always been fond of fashion - there was nothing I wouldn't trade for the satisfaction of clothes. However, convincing my Latino parents to let me pursue fashion-related activities was difficult. Especially for an immigrant family that only wanted me to pursue more basic, well-rounded occupations. From elementary to high school, conforming to normalcy was something I strayed away from. When my peers donned their Canadian red toques and plaid sweatpants, I wore something that looked like it came out of The Matrix. When they laughed, I wore more vibrant colors and odd proportions. When they misunderstood my purpose, I immersed myself more into fashion, analyzing the current collections on Vogue Runway. I disliked how my school lacked individuality and uniqueness. That is, until I found the Advertising and Marketing Communications program at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT). It was a beacon of hope for me; a program that includes fashion and business. I have been working tirelessly ever since. From designing and modeling in my first fashion show in my freshman year to evolving my expansion into digital composition and excelling in courses like Marketing and Communications Technology. I am currently the Vision Head in the United Artists Council. My role consists of having to maintain and craft the vision of the fashion show. The United Artists Council is a collective of seven heads that cultivate a performance show to raise money for a different charity every year. With the last performance able to raise over $3000, this year's charity is the Henry's Foundation; a Canadian-based organization that focuses on de-stigmatizing mental health. I also oversee the heads of design and modeling to make sure their work aligns with the basis of the theme. Currently, the theme I've made for this year's show was to promote the idea of a "sandbox", which is essentially a free terrain of creative expression. Exhibiting themes of inclusivity and diversity, the show will consist of both male and female students of all sizes and colors. I believe I am fully equipped with the required attributes for the challenging and insightful curriculum that the FIT has in-store for me. With over a year's experience as a Customer Care Associate at Leon's Furniture, I have been able to challenge and improve on my problem solving, collaboration, and interpersonal skills. I have also worked on the management side of Leon's - crunching numbers and hitting deadlines. The Advertising and Marketing Communications (AMC) major is for people that want to make a change in the world. I believe being in a competitive environment will inspire me to think deeper into my inventiveness. It will be the inciting force to create new fresh ideas. The curriculum encourages students to work on their business and creative apprehension. The AMC major has classes that are necessary to thrive in the advertising and communication world. From programs like Excel and Photoshop, to workshops in Fashion Journalism and Public Relations, having knowledge in these subjects are crucial to achieve success in this industry. I can appreciate the fact that this program also has professors that are equipped with years of industry experience. This allows them to nurture and hone the skill of any student. FIT is my gateway to success. Known for its diverse student body, notable alumni and faculty, FIT will help me thrive in an industry I am positive I will succeed in. I am aware that New York City is not for the light-hearted and will require a lot of hard-work to get to my desired destination, but I am prepared to take on any challenge FIT has to offer. With my determination and integrity, I hope to one day use fashion as an outlet to inspire young adolescents just like me to follow their goals and aspirations. (Word Count: 729)</span></div></div>

Finally, when I participated in my first Hackathon, I realized that coding and engineering skills allow me to integrate new technology innovations into our future.

I was doing well until he applied to Kyungbok university and flew to Korea, leaving me alone with obstacles that helped me examine myself and opened the self-study world for me. Finally, when I participated in my first Hackathon, I realized that coding and engineering skills allow me to integrate new technology innovations into our future. After that, I organized a community for girls who desire to make a typical science-fiction future world come true and prove to everyone that girls could be in tech as well as boys. After all, thanks to my friend and my community, I can be sure that nothing better matches me as the Information Technologies field, and majoring in the Computer Engineering program will help fulfill my desire to develop technologies that can improve people's everyday lives.</span></div></div>

As a graduate of Mathematics, i developed a fascination towards data which prompt me to secure a job as a data enter officer; during these period, i have tried to better myself attending online courses on data analysis which has enlightened and broaden my horizon as to the need for data analysts and scientists in all sector for improved performances. This fascination of mine turned passion has fuelled my interest to apply for the Petroleum Technology Development Fund(PTDF) scholarship to obtain a masters (MSc) degree in Data Science at the University of Salford. I am particularly keen to study at the University of Salford because they meet my criteria. Firstly, their methodology of teaching includes 50% of practical projects and 50% examination which will prepare students for real life problem solving skills as a data scientist. Secondly, the course modules include data analytics, data mining, advanced database which I find invaluable to my career development as a data scientist. Lastly, the school has a long standing and existing relationship with Nigerian students to the extent of having an office in Lagos, Nigeria. With data science in the oil and gas industry, recent research shows that data gathered from drilling can be applied to conduct various analyses from scheduling to drilling operations thereby improving drilling performance. Also, in production engineering, big data analytics can optimize the performance of production pumps while it can also manage risks and enhance safety by improving oil and gas occupational safety. From my past experience as a data entry officer, studying data science at the University of Salford will provide me the technical skills needed to predict and guide the nation's oil and gas sector into the future of the industry, if given the chance. The future of oil and gas industry lies with data science and i believe with the right minds, we can move the nation forward. In terms of national development, data science can help predict and utilise majority of the natural gas which is being flared off subsequently enhancing the output of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for the masses. Also, with its predictions, oil production capacity can be optimised, improving the export capacity of the nation as well as increasing the government revenue. Applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence provides oil and gas industry the ability to identify trends and predict events throughout processes which will enable quick response to disruption and improve efficiencies. From PTDF objectives, this scholarship would boost my career development and as the saying goes, "data is just like crude; it is valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be put to good use". I aim to impact the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry through data science in whatever capacity I can when i get back from my postgraduate studies. On this note, i look forward to a successful application and commencing my academic career at the University of Salford as a PTDF scholar.</span></div></div>

Squinting through the eyepiece, I was in disbelief over how sophisticated a supposedly simple tissue could be - cells of many different types carrying out their distinct roles in perfect harmony. It didn't take long for this disbelief to grow into curiosity about the efficient intricacy of the body, driving me to explore bioengineering. I understood that the central theme of this discipline is to use technology to develop treatments for diseases - technology evolves and new diseases are discovered, both on a continuous basis, so bioengineering is an ever-expanding, recession-proof career. I realized I would love to work in a field that allows constant learning. In school, I am particularly keen about Biology. Unlike Math and Chemistry, which are more abstract studies, I find Biology more easily applicable, since it explores the functionality of the body and our interactions with other organisms. Every Biology lesson feels like self-discovery. In Year 12, I had to choose between A Level Math and Biology. After consideration, I opted for Biology, and decided to push myself by studying Math on my own, using online resources to guide me. Studying a two-year course independently enabled me to develop a degree of academic endurance that would benefit me in advanced studies. Also, being my own teacher, I did not need to limit myself and follow a confined syllabus - I also ventured into complex integration, vector mechanics and probability distribution models. Studying A Level Biology built me a framework for deeper studies in biomedicine. The topics cell biology and genetic technology fascinated me the most, and allowed me to build a fundamental understanding of existing and emerging techniques involved in disease diagnosis. In Chemistry and Physics, I enjoyed learning concepts like organic chemistry, electronic circuits, and thermodynamics, and then applying this knowledge in practical classes. During the summer, I undertook a 4-week university-level course on the basics of biomedical engineering, in which I was introduced to the coding programs Arduino and MATLAB, and learned to analyze sensor data using MATLAB code, and then use this to control bionic prosthetics in a closed loop. The course greatly benefited me, as it yielded insight into the programming aspect of the field. Currently, I am working on the Cambridge EPQ (CIPQ), in which I based my research report on the possibility of using CRISPR and RNA splicing to treat cancers more effectively. The report contains information I gathered using a set of research methods, primarily literature reviews (theses and articles on molecular biology). The project allowed me to stretch my learning and thinking abilities and gain an overview of writing university theses. I understand that a real-world engineer must also possess interpersonal skills. Participating and ranking 1st nationally in the IOF Cyber Olympiads boosted my problem-solving skills, and also complemented my A Level studies. My acumen as a leader was sharpened by leading my school's senior student council as Head Boy. I have played club cricket for YTCA's U-16 and U-19 teams in provincial tournaments since 2017. Playing a sport has developed my game and transformed me into a much improved communicator and team worker. I have also been part of AUD Model UN as a delegate, and enjoyed working with other students to propose solutions to global issues. I often volunteer for environmental and charitable programs, including Walks for Education and EEG Cleanup Campaigns. Through this Bachelor of Engineering program, I hope to transform myself into a technically-equipped nano-engineering researcher, and work towards my long-term goal of discovering new medical applications of nanoparticles, a study that can revolutionize the healthcare industry.</span></div></div>

Through this Bachelor of Engineering program, I hope to transform myself into a technically-equipped nano-engineering researcher, and work towards my long-term goal of discovering new medical applications of nanoparticles, a study that can revolutionize the healthcare industry.</span></div></div>

There have been many moments of uncertainty during this period, but we tacked them together as a team. The confidence which we had in ourselves, by giving our best, kept us going. I learnt to work in a team and made many new friends, thereby improving my social skills. Moreover, I learnt to deal with deadlines and stress at an elevated level. There have been moments when major issues in design were detected at the last moment, conflicts arose between ourselves, and I had to spend sleepless nights working with my teammates. Keeping cool and finding workarounds, making minor compromises to fix major flaws in time, predicting potential risks to the deadline ahead of time- these are the skills which I gained working. As a result, it turned out to be a lot more than just an enriching academic experience.

Since then, nature has become a great fascination to me. I started to realize that with intelligence, sapiens have evolved and developed tremendously. However, if we keep on exploiting the natural resources and do not put a brake on carbon emission, this planet will inevitably encounter another mass extinction that has already taken place on many species nowadays. If I get accepted by UWC, I would like to further develop my skills and interest in starting a project that aims at preserving nature and wildlife. With UWC's diversity, we can make the project more global, and it will hopefully create a wide impact on human beings. Furthermore, I hope through the project to pursue my goal in further education and a career that will make the world a sustainable place to live in.</span></div></div>

One day, my English teacher approached me with a huge water bottle and said I motivated her to hydrate. I was touched by how consistency could be a form of inspiration to people around me, so I brought this trait to bigger things in life such as leading the Charity Art Club with consistent effort rather than bursting all my passion at once. I am proud that my "consistency" is not just integrated with the small stuff, but also allowing me to take on greater responsibilities. Now as a senior, I know exactly how underclassmen with acne feel, which always motivates me to reach out. I would observe and help in different approaches. For example, while some people might be looking for skincare advice, others might feel uncomfortable discussing it. As situations demanded, I adapted. Sometimes, I would provide a detailed plan for my sister; I would stand up for the freshman who got taunted. Other times, by simply showing my worst acne picture or making sure to not bring up acne topics to the table would make my friends with acne feel better.
