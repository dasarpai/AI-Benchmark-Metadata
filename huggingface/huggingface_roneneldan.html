Jane walked closer to the tree and saw that the powder was made of tiny green pieces. \n\n\&quot;What is that Daddy?\&quot; Jane asked. \n\n\&quot;That's special powder, Jane,\&quot; her daddy replied. \&quot;Let's gather some of it together and take it home with us.\&quot;\n\nSo Jane and her daddy started gathering the powder into a bucket. They filled the bucket up with the powder and started walking home. \n\nWhen they got home, Daddy asked Jane what she wanted to do with the green powder. \n\n\&quot;Let's make a special cake with it,\&quot; she said.\n\nSo, Jane and her daddy used the green powder to make a special cake. They cut it up and shared it between them.

One day, a little bird named Benny flew to Elly. Benny saw that Elly was sad and asked, "Why are you sad, Elly?" Elly told Benny that she felt ugly and did not like her big ears and long nose. Benny looked at Elly and said, "I think you are not ugly. You are special."

Benny promised to show Elly how her big ears and long nose made her special. They went to the river, and Benny asked Elly to use her long nose to spray water on the dry plants. Elly did and the plants grew happy and green. Then, Benny asked Elly to use her big ears to fan the hot animals. Elly did, and all the animals felt cool and happy.

Elly learned that being different was not ugly. She was special and had her own way to help others. Elly and Benny became best friends, and they lived happily ever after.</span></div></div>

Every day, Cindy would go to the store to get milk for her family. She loved the store and was always greeted by the friendly shopkeeper.

One day when Cindy was at the store, she noticed something strange: the shelves were all empty! She asked the shopkeeper why the shelves were empty. "It's too hard for you to understand," the shopkeeper said.

Cindy wasn't happy about this. But she had to trust the shopkeeper. So, she said goodbye and went home.

When Cindy told her family the news they didn't recognize the problem. But then they noticed something even more strange: the milk was gone too!

The family soon realized what had happened: the shopkeeper had been preparing for a snowstorm and had run out of milk. They were relieved that the shopkeeper had already taken care of the problem.

Cindy was happy that she had recognized the problem. Next time, she would know that she shouldn't leave getting milk too late.</span></div></div>

The old man said, â€œMy name is Wilbur and I was just minding my own business when I saw you walking towards the arrow. I was worried that you may get injured, so I shouted.â€
Annie smiled and said, â€œThank you Wilbur, I will mind your advice."
Wilbur smiled back and replied, â€œThatâ€™s very wise young lady. Now why donâ€™t we just run away and leave the arrow in peace?â€

When she got to school, all the other students crowded around to admire her dress. She was so proud and happy. She knew that it was the best choice she had ever made.

But then her teacher told her she couldn't wear it. The dress was too fancy, too 'fit' for school. She felt so sad and embarrassed. Tears ran down her face, and she had to go home without her perfect dress.

Sam laughed and said, "I think I should pick a better word next time!"

Bob smiled and nodded. "That's a good idea. We should always pick the right word to use when we talk to each other."

One day the warrior sailed away to explore the world on a small boat. They sailed around for hours and hours, eventually coming to a new land.

The warrior was curious so they jumped off the boat and started to explore. But it was uncomfortable, so the warrior decided to go back to the boat.

In their hurry to get back, the warrior called out, â€œQuick! Quick!â€. It was then that a friendly bird flew over. The warrior smiled and asked the bird, â€œDo you know a faster way to sail?â€ 

The bird replied, â€œOf course! Follow me, I'll show you!â€ The warrior quickly hopped on the boat and followed the bird. 

The bird showed the warrior how to make the boat sail faster and soon the warrior was on their way. The breeze was gentle and the warrior felt comfortable once again. 

The warrior thanked the bird for showing them the way and sailed away, never to forget the bird's kindness.</span></div></div>

But then, to her surprise, she felt something cold. She looked down and saw the ground was covered in snow. The little girl gasped.

She quickly ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, there's snow outside! Can we go play?"

Her mom chuckled and said, "Yes, but we have to grab a sack first."

So they went outside and gathered up the snow in a sack. The little girl was so excited that she twirled around and around, making a mini snow storm. 

They took the sack home and put it near the fireplace. The little girl wanted to play with the snow all day, and her mom said she could do just that.

So the little girl spent the day playing with the snow until the sack was empty. It was cold but still so much fun!</span></div></div>

Her dad laughed and smiled, "That man is showing off his money! He's wealthy and he wants everyone to know."

This made little Lucy excited. She wished she had money too. She wanted to show off her wealth like the man.

But then her dad said something that made her sad. He said, "It's just playing pretend. You don't need money to have fun!"

So Lucy put away her dreams of being wealthy and went back to playing with her toys. But secretly she still hoped one day she could show off her own wealth too!</span></div></div>

He ran for hours and hours, never stopping for a rest. The weight grew heavier and heavier, but the boy never thought about it. He kept on running, ever faster and ever further.

Just then, a voice called out from behind her. It was an old woman. 
 
"Do you like it?" she said.

Mary was a bit anxious but nodded and smiled.

"It's yours," the woman said warmly. "I saw you admiring it and thought you might like to have it."

Mary thanked the woman politely, before heading home with the new silver necklace in her pocket. From that day onward, every time Mary chewed her lunch in the park, she would also play with her silver necklace, and think back to the day when she had first seen it.</span></div></div>
