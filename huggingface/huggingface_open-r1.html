You will get the cat's response, as depicted on the corresponding map, via standard in. For simplicity all responses are written in lowercase.\n\nOnce you're certain what type of cat you're dealing with, output \&quot;normal\&quot; or \&quot;grumpy\&quot; to standard out.&quot;:1,&quot;At each turn, you must output exactly three vertices $$$a, b, c$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a, b, c \\leq n)$$$. For the first time, $$$3$$$ vertices displayed will indicate which vertices you originally placed bees on. In response, you will receive the vertex where the jury placed Nastya. Each next $$$3$$$ vertices will indicate where the $$$3$$$ bees move at your turn. Each of the bees can, regardless of other bees, both remain at the current vertex and move along the edge. After the next output of $$$3$$$ vertices, in response, you get the number of the new vertex to which Nastya went.\n\nAs soon as one of the bees is at the same vertex with Nastya or you have reached the limit on the number of moves, your program should stop working. That is if you made a move, and one of the bees ended up at the same vertex with Nastya, your program must stop working, or if Nastya made a move and ended up at the same vertex with one of the bees, you should not make your move and the program should stop working.\n\nIf the number of moves exceeds limit ($$$n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the number of vertices), you will get the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nYour solution may receive the verdict Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't output anything or forget to flush the output buffer.\n\nTo flush the output buffer, you need to do the following immediately after printing the query and the line end:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- for other languages see documentation.\n\nIn this problem interactor is adaptive. This means that depending on all your previous moves, Nastya's behavior may change.\n\nHacks are not available for this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;For each question, if you want to ask about a set $$$S$$$, first print the character '?', then print the size of $$$S$$$ and then print the elements of $$$S$$$ one by one. Each element should be an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, the elements must be distinct. After each question, read a string \&quot;YES\&quot; or \&quot;NO\&quot;, as explained in the statement. You can make at most $$$82$$$ such questions.\n\nIf you want to guess for $$$x$$$, first print the character '!' and then print your guess. After each guess, read \&quot;:)\&quot; or \&quot;:(\&quot;. If you guess $$$x$$$ correctly, the answer is \&quot;:)\&quot; and your program should terminate immediately, otherwise you'll receive \&quot;:(\&quot;.

Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a choice for a player, or a turn, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.

To do that, print a line with the following format: \&quot;- x\&quot; ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$).\n\nAfter this operation, the number $$$x$$$ is subtracted from $$$n$$$, and therefore $$$n$$$ is changed. If the number $$$x$$$ is greater than the current value of $$$n$$$, then the request is considered invalid.\n\nAfter the operation read a line containing a single non-negative integer $$$\\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the current $$$n$$$ after the operation.\n\nWhen you know the initial value of $$$n$$$, print one line in the following format: \&quot;! n\&quot; ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).\n\nAfter that, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there are none.\n\nIf your program performs more than $$$30$$$ operations for one test case, subtracts a number $$$x$$$ greater than $$$n$$$, or makes an incorrect request, then response to the request will be -1, after receiving such response, your program must exit immediately to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get any other verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

To make a query, output on a separate line:\n\n- \&quot;? a b\&quot;, where $$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$a \\neq b$$$. In response to the query, the interactor will output on a separate line the length of a random simple path from vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$ (not to be confused with the path from $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$), or $$$-1$$$ if $$$\\max(a, b) > n$$$. The interactor chooses one of the two paths with equal probability.\n\nIf your program gets a number 0 as a result of a query, it means that the verdict for your solution is already defined as \&quot;wrong answer\&quot; (for example, you made more than $$$50$$$ queries or made an invalid query). In this case, your program should terminate immediately. Otherwise, in this scenario you may get a random verdict \&quot;Execution error\&quot;, \&quot;Exceeded time limit\&quot; or some other verdict instead of \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n\nThe answer, like queries, print on a separate line. The output of the answer is not counted as a query when counting them. To print it, use the following format:\n\n- \&quot;! n\&quot;: the expected size of the hidden graph ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$).\n\nAfter that, your program should terminate.\n\nAfter the output of the next query, be sure to use stream cleaning functions so that some of your output is not left in some buffer. For example, in C++ you should use function flush(stdout), in Java call System.out.flush(), in Pascal flush(output) and stdout.flush() for Python.\n\nNote that the interactor is implemented in such a way that for any ordered pair $$$(a, b)$$$, it always returns the same value for query \&quot;? a b\&quot;, no matter how many such queries. Note that the \&quot;? b a\&quot; query may be answered differently by the interactor.\n\nThe vertices in the graph are randomly placed, and their positions are fixed in advance.\n\nHacks are forbidden in this problem. The number of tests the jury has is $$$50$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;Initially your program will be fed a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of lamps in the game. Then the interactor will wait for your actions.\n\nTo make a move, print a line starting with an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$), followed by $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$l_1, \\ldots, l_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq n$$$) — indices of lamps you want to turn on. The indices may be printed in any order. It is allowed to try to turn on a lamp that is already on (although this will have no effect).\n\nIf your move was invalid for any reason, or if you have made more than $$$10^4$$$ moves, the interactor will reply with a line containing a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, the reply will be a line containing a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n)$$$, meaning that the response was to turn off $$$k$$$ consecutive lamps starting from $$$x$$$ in clockwise order.\n\nTo terminate the game instead of making a move, print a line containing a single integer $$$0$$$. The test will be passed if at this point there are at least $$$R(n)$$$ lamps turned on (note that neither $$$R(n)$$$, nor the verdict received are not communicated to your program in any way). This action does not count towards the number of moves (that is, it is legal to terminate the game after exactly $$$10^4$$$ moves).\n\nTo receive the correct verdict, your program should terminate immediately after printing $$$0$$$, or after receiving $$$-1$$$ as a response.\n\nDon't forget to flush your output after every action.&quot;:1,&quot;Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description and the interactive section of each test case.\n\nFor each test case, you begin the interaction by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n \\le 1000$$$) in the first line, indicating the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq d_i \\leq n - 1$$$), where $$$d_i$$$ is the degree of vertex $$$i$$$.\n\nTo make a query on vertex $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u \\leq n$$$), you should output\n\n- \&quot;? $$$u$$$\&quot;\n\nTo give the answer, you should output\n\n- \&quot;! $$$c_1$$$ $$$c_2$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$c_n$$$\&quot;\n\nIt is guaranteed that the graph is a simple undirected graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.\n\nIn case your query format is invalid, or you have made more than $$$n$$$ \&quot;?\&quot; queries, you will receive Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

The following lines contain the description of each test case.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$), indicating the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThen $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains an integer $$$d_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq d_i \\leq n - 1$$$), indicating the degree of vertex $$$i$$$, and then $$$d_i$$$ distinct integers $$$e_{i,1}, e_{i,2}, \\dots, e_{i,d_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq e_{i, j} \\leq n$$$ and $$$e_{i,j} \\neq i$$$), where $$$\\left(i, e_{i,j}\\right)$$$ is the $$$j$$$-th edge incident to vertex $$$i$$$.\n\nIt should be guaranteed that the graph is a simple undirected graph.\n\nIt should be guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;From the technical side, this problem is interactive. Therefore, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Also, do not read more than you need. To flush the output, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.&quot;:1,&quot;First, output $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$m$$$ integers, representing the integers that you filled in the grid.

The interactor and you take turns outputting coordinates to select a cell for $$$n \\times m$$$ turns, with the interactor starting first.\n\nOn each player's (either you or the interactor) turn, the player will output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$), denoting that the player has selected the cell on the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column. This cell should not have been selected in a previous round. Additionally, if it is not the first turn, the cell must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one previously selected cell.\n\nIf any of your outputs are invalid, the jury will output \&quot;-1\&quot; and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAt the end of all $$$n \\cdot m$$$ turns, if the sum of numbers in the cells selected by you is not strictly less than the sum of numbers in the cells selected by the interactor, the jury will output \&quot;-1\&quot; and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nIf your program has received a Wrong Answer verdict, it must terminate immediately. Otherwise, you may receive an arbitrary verdict because your solution might be reading from a closed stream.\n\nAfter outputting, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIn this problem, hacks are disabled.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$6 \\le n,m \\le 1000$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are even) — the dimensions of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line contains four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1, x_2 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_1, y_2 \\le m$$$) — the positions of the white and the black knight. It is guaranteed that the two knights have different starting positions. It is also guaranteed that none of the knights are in their own target square in the beginning of the game (however, they can be on the opponent's target position).\n\nYour program should reply with either \&quot;WHITE\&quot; or \&quot;BLACK\&quot;, depending on the knight you want to play with. In case you select the white knight, you start the game.\n\nDuring every your turn, you need to print two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, the position to move the knight. If you won the game by this turn, you must terminate your program immediately.\n\nAfter every turn of the opponent, you will receive two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, the position where Bob moved his knight.\n\nIf your last move was illegal or you lost the game after jury's turn, or you made $$$350$$$ moves, and haven't won, you will receive \&quot;-1 -1\&quot;. In such cases, you should terminate your program and then you will get a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing anything, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you might get Idleness limit exceeded.

To ask a query, print a line of form \&quot;? $$$a$$$ $$$b$$$ $$$c$$$\&quot;, where $$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le n$$$. After that you should read a single line containing \&quot;Yes\&quot; or \&quot;No\&quot; depending on the answer of the query.\n\nThe tree is fixed for each test and it doesn't depend on your queries.\n\nWhen you are ready to print the answer, print a line of the form \&quot;! $$$s$$$\&quot;, where $$$s$$$ is the label of the root vertex and then terminate your program.\n\nAfter printing each query do not forget to print end of line and flush the output.

Then read the value of $$$a_i$$$ in a separate line. The number of the \&quot;?\&quot; queries is limited within $$$100$$$.\n\nWhen you find an index $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) which is a local minimum, output \&quot;! $$$k$$$\&quot; in a separate line and terminate your program.\n\nIn case your query format is invalid, or you have made more than $$$100$$$ \&quot;?\&quot; queries, you will receive Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

First, print the size of $$$S$$$ in its own line. In the following line, print $$$|S|$$$ space-separated distinct integers, denoting the vertices in $$$S$$$.\n2. Similarly, print the size of $$$T$$$ in its own line. In the following line, print $$$|T|$$$ space-separated distinct integers, denoting the vertices in $$$T$$$.\n3. Then, in the final line, print $$$v$$$ — the vertex that you choose for this question.\n4. Read Mikaela's answer from input.\n\nBe reminded that $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ must be disjoint and non-empty.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIf your program asks too many questions, asks an invalid question or does not correctly follow the interaction guideline above, it may receive an arbitrary verdict. Otherwise, your program will receive the Wrong Answer verdict if it reports an incorrect tree.\n\nNote that the tree is fixed beforehand and does not depend on your queries.\n\nHacks\n\nHacks should be formatted as follows.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 500$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $$$n-1$$$ lines should each contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, denoting the existence of an undirected edge $$$(u, v)$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;You begin the interaction by reading $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.\n\n- To ask your friend to taste a cup of coffee produced by the café $$$c$$$, in a separate line output? $$$c$$$Where $$$c$$$ must satisfy $$$1 \\le c \\le n$$$. Don't forget to flush, to get the answer.In response, you will receive a single letter Y (yes) or N (no), telling you if variety $$$a_c$$$ is one of the last $$$k$$$ varieties of coffee in his memory.\n- To reset the memory of your friend, in a separate line output the single letter R in upper case. You can do this operation at most $$$30\\ 000$$$ times.\n- When you determine the number $$$d$$$ of different coffee varieties, output! $$$d$$$\n\nIn case your query is invalid, you asked more than $$$\\frac{2n^2}{k}$$$ queries of type ? or you asked more than $$$30\\ 000$$$ queries of type R, the program will print the letter E and will finish interaction. You will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack format\n\nThe first line should contain the word fixed\n\nThe second line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, separated by space ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 1024$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ are powers of two).\n\nIt must hold that $$$\\dfrac{2n^2}{k} \\le 20\\ 000$$$.\n\nThe third line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, separated by spaces ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;Your code is allowed to query for an entry $$$(i, j)$$$ of a matrix (i.e. get the height of the tree which is in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column). The query should be formatted as ? $$$i$$$ $$$j$$$, so that $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$.\n\nYou may assume that the entries of the matrix will be integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$.\n\nYour solution should use not more than $$$\\mathbf{4 \\cdot (n + m)}$$$ queries.\n\nThis is an interactive problem. You have to use a flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout), in Java — System.out.flush(), in Pascal — flush(output) and in Python — sys.stdout.flush().&quot;:1,&quot;You can ask queries by printing \&quot;? $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$\&quot; $$$(1 \\leq l < r \\leq n)$$$. The answer is the index of the second maximum of all elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$. Array $$$a$$$ is fixed beforehand and can't be changed in time of interaction.\n\nYou can output the answer by printing \&quot;! $$$p$$$\&quot;, where $$$p$$$ is the index of the maximum element in the array.\n\nYou can ask no more than 40 queries. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, use the following test format.\n\nIn the first line output a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$. In the second line output a permutation of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The position of $$$n$$$ in the permutation is the position of the maximum&quot;:1,&quot;Interaction begins after reading $$$n$$$ and array $$$a$$$.\n\nYou should start interaction by printing a single line, containing either \&quot;First\&quot; or \&quot;Second\&quot;, representing the player you select.\n\nOn each round, the following happens:\n\n- If you are playing as the first player, you should print a single integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) on a separate line. After that, you should read a single integer $$$j$$$ ($$$-1 \\le j \\le n$$$) written on a separate line.If $$$j = -1$$$, then you made an incorrect move. In this case your program should terminate immediately.If $$$j = 0$$$, then the second player can't make a correct move and you win the game. In this case your program should also terminate immediately.Otherwise $$$j$$$ is equal to the index chosen by the second player, and you should proceed to the next round.\n- If you are playing as the second player, you should read a single integer $$$i$$$ ($$$-1 \\le i \\le n$$$) written on a separate line.If $$$i = -1$$$, then you made an incorrect move on the previous round (this cannot happen on the first round). In that case your program should terminate immediately.If $$$i = 0$$$, then the first player can't make a correct move and you win the game. In this case your program should also terminate immediately.Otherwise $$$i$$$ is equal to the index chosen by first player. In this case you should write single integer $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$) on a separate line and proceed to the next round.\n\nAfter printing $$$i$$$ or $$$j$$$, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nHacks are disabled in this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;Your program has to process multiple test cases in one run. First, it should read the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t \\ge 1$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, it should process the test cases one by one.\n\nIn each test case, your program should start by reading the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of players to select out of $$$2n$$$ players. The sum of squares of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10\\,000$$$.\n\nThen your program can organize matches zero or more times. To organize a match, your program should print a match description formatted as ? $$$i$$$ $$$j$$$ — a question mark followed by two distinct numbers of players participating in the match. The players are numbered from 1 to $$$2n$$$, inclusive. Remember to flush the output after printing the match description. Then your program should read the match outcome — it will be either the greater-than character (>), if the first player in the match description has higher strength, or the less-than character (<), if the second player in the match description has higher strength.\n\nYour program can organize at most $$$4n^2$$$ matches. After it is done organizing matches, it should print the exclamation mark (!) and continue to the next test case, or exit gracefully if this was the last test case. Remember to flush the output after printing the exclamation mark.\n\nThere must be exactly one way to choose $$$n$$$ players with the highest strength that is consistent with the outcomes of the matches you organized, but there must be at least two possible orderings of those $$$n$$$ players by their strength that are consistent with the outcomes of the matches you organized.\n\nThe judging program picks some distinct numbers as the strengths of all players before your program starts organizing matches and uses them to answer the requests.&quot;:1,&quot;Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test starts with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the number of nodes on each side of the bipartition.\n\nThe next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_{ij} \\leq n^2$$$). $$$a_{ij}$$$ denotes the weight of the edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$j+n$$$. All $$$a_{ij}$$$ will be distinct.\n\nYou first print a string \&quot;A\&quot; or \&quot;B\&quot;, denoting which player you want to play (\&quot;A\&quot; for Alice and \&quot;B\&quot; for Bob).\n\nIf playing as Alice, first print either \&quot;I\&quot; or \&quot;D\&quot; (denoting whether you choose \&quot;increasing\&quot; or \&quot;decreasing\&quot;). Then, print the node that you wish to start at.\n\nIf playing as Bob, read in a character \&quot;I\&quot; or \&quot;D\&quot; (denoting whether the judge chose \&quot;increasing\&quot; or \&quot;decreasing\&quot;), then the node that the judge chooses to start at.\n\nTo make a move, print the index of the node that you wish to go to. To read what move the judge made, read an integer from standard in.\n\nIf the judge responds with $$$-1$$$, then that means the judge has determined it has no legal moves (or it may have just given up) and that you won the case. Stop processing this case immediately and start processing the next case.\n\nIf the judge responds with $$$-2$$$, that means that the judge has determined that you made an invalid move, so you should exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nIf you are unable to make a move or give up, print $$$-1$$$ and then exit immediately. This will give you a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a move do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t=1$$$).\n\nThe second line should contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$).\n\nThe next $$$n$$$ lines should contain $$$n$$$ integers each, the $$$a_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_{ij} \\leq n^2$$$). $$$a_{ij}$$$ denotes the weight of the edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$j+n$$$. All $$$a_{ij}$$$ must be distinct.\n\nThe judge will play a uniformly random legal move with this case versus the hacked program. If it has no legal moves left, it will give up and declare the player as the winner.&quot;:1,&quot;In the first line you should print an integer $$$q$$$ $$$(0 \\le q \\le \\lceil 0.65 \\cdot c \\rceil)$$$ — the number of queries you want to ask. After that in the same line print $$$q$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_q$$$ $$$(1 \\le x_i \\le c)$$$ — the queries.\n\nFor these queries you should read $$$q$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of them is the answer to the described query for $$$x = x_i$$$.\n\nAfter that you should print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$A'_1, A'_2, \\ldots, A'_n$$$ — the set $$$A'$$$ you found.\n\nIf there are different sets $$$A'$$$ that have the same answers for all possible queries, print any of them.\n\nIf you will ask more than $$$\\lceil 0.65 \\cdot c \\rceil$$$ queries or if the queries will be invalid, the interactor will terminate immediately and your program will receive verdict Wrong Answer.\n\nAfter printing the queries and answers do not forget to output end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will get the Idleness limit exceeded verdict. To do flush use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- Read documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nYou cannot make hacks in this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;You start the interaction by reading the number $$$n$$$.\n\nTo ask a query about a substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), you should output\n\n? l r\n\non a separate line. After this, all substrings of $$$s[l..r]$$$ will be returned in random order, each substring exactly once. In every returned substring all characters will be randomly shuffled.\n\nIn the case, if you ask an incorrect query, ask more than $$$3$$$ queries of the first type or there will be more than $$$\\left\\lceil 0.777(n+1)^2 \\right\\rceil$$$ substrings returned in total, you will receive verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo guess the string $$$s$$$, you should output\n\n! s\n\non a separate line.\n\nAfter printing each query, do not forget to flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To flush the output, you can use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIf you received - (dash) as an answer to any query, you need to terminate your program with exit code 0 (for example, by calling exit(0)). This means that there was an error in the interaction protocol. If you don't terminate with exit code 0, you can receive any unsuccessful verdict.\n\nHack format\n\nTo hack a solution, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the string, and the following line should contain the string $$$s$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question of the first type, use the format:\n\n- $$$1$$$ $$$a$$$ $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\le a,b \\le n-1$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$).\n- we will answer with $$$1$$$ if the passage is from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$, and $$$0$$$ if it is from $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$.\n- you can ask at most $$$9n$$$ questions of this type in each test case.\n\nTo ask a question of the second type, use the format:\n\n- $$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$k$$$ $$$s_1$$$ $$$s_2$$$ ... $$$s_k$$$ ($$$0 \\le x,s_i \\le n-1$$$, $$$0 \\le k < n$$$, $$$x \\neq s_i$$$, elements of $$$s$$$ are pairwise distinct).\n- we will answer with $$$1$$$ if there's a passage from $$$x$$$ to any of the rooms in $$$s$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.\n- you can ask at most $$$2n$$$ questions of this type in each test case.\n\nIf we answer with $$$-1$$$ instead of a valid answer, that means you exceeded the number of queries or made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks:\n\nThe first line should contain an integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of rooms.\n\nEach of the next $$$n$$$ lines should contain a binary string of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th string should be $$$1$$$ if there's a passage from room $$$i$$$ to room $$$j$$$, $$$0$$$ otherwise. The $$$i$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th string should be $$$0$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To make a query, print a line with the format \&quot;? $$$h$$$ $$$w$$$ $$$i_1$$$ $$$j_1$$$ $$$i_2$$$ $$$j_2$$$ \&quot;, where the integers are the height and width and the coordinates of upper left corners of non-overlapping rectangles, about which you want to know if they are equal or not.\n\nAfter each query read a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$): if the subrectangles are equal, $$$t=1$$$, otherwise $$$t=0$$$.\n\nIn case your query is of incorrect format or you asked more than $$$3 \\cdot \\left \\lfloor{ \\log_2{(n+m)} } \\right \\rfloor$$$ queries, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the matrix $$$a$$$ is fixed and won't change during the interaction process.\n\nHacks format\n\nFor hacks use the following format.\n\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 1000$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers — the elements of matrix $$$a$$$. All the elements of the matrix must be integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n \\cdot m$$$, inclusive.&quot;:1,&quot;The scheduling algorithm must be real-time. It means the solution must print the answer to $$$i$$$-th operation before it gets the line with $$$(i+1)$$$-th operation.\n\nSo, after your program reads the initial part of the input, it needs to interact with the judger $$$M$$$ times. For each interaction, the judger will provide a single line as an input for your program. This line contains two integers which represent the pair $$$A_{i} = (U_{i}, P_{i})$$$ of the operation sequence ($$$1 \\le U_i \\le N$$$, $$$1 \\le P_i \\le D_{U_i}$$$). For each of the $$$M$$$ operations $$$A_{i}$$$, print a line containing a single integer $$$C_{i}$$$: the buffer location accessed by that operation ($$$1 \\le C_i \\le Q$$$).\n\nFor correct interaction, print the end-of-line after each command and flush the output buffer with the respective functions of your programming language:\n\n- cout.flush() or fflush(stdout) for C/C++;\n- stdout.flush() for Python;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nOtherwise, your solution will get the \&quot;Idleness Limit Exceeded\&quot; outcome.&quot;:1,&quot;This is an interactive task. In the beginning you are given a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\leq T \\leq 100$$$), the number of cases in the test.\n\nFor each test case, the input first contains a single integer — the value of $$$N$$$ ($$$1 < N \\le 10^{18}$$$). The value of $$$C$$$ is kept secret by the grading system.\n\nThen your program should make queries writing output in the following format: \&quot;? $$$P$$$\&quot;, where $$$P$$$ is an integer ($$$1 \\le P \\le N$$$) denoting the next color used. For each query the grading system gives an answer in the next line of the input. The answer is $$$1$$$ if Archie notices the color difference between the last two colors and $$$0$$$ otherwise. No two queries should have the same $$$P$$$ value.\n\nWhen your program determines $$$C$$$, it should output its value in the following format: \&quot;= $$$C$$$\&quot;. The grading system will not respond to this output and will proceed with the next test case.\n\nYour program may use at most 64 queries \&quot;?\&quot; for each test case to find the correct value of $$$C$$$.\n\nTo establish proper communication between your program and the grading system, you should flush the output stream after each query.\n\n$$$$$$\\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Language} &amp; \\text{Command} \\\\ \\hline \\text{C++} &amp; \\texttt{std::cout }\\texttt{<}\\texttt{<}\\texttt{ std::endl;} \\\\ \\text{Java} &amp; \\texttt{System.out.flush();} \\\\ \\text{Python} &amp; \\texttt{sys.stdout.flush()} \\end{array}$$$$$$ Flush commands\n\nNote that std::endl writes a newline and flushes the stream.\n\nIt is possible to receive an \&quot;Output isn't correct\&quot; outcome even after printing a correct answer, if task constraints were violated during the communication. Violating the communication protocol itself may result in an \&quot;Execution killed\&quot; outcome.\n\nSubmitting user tests requires specifying an input file with the testcase parameters. The format of the input file is \&quot;$$$T$$$\&quot; in the first line, and then \&quot;$$$N$$$ $$$C$$$\&quot; on a single line for each of the $$$T$$$ cases.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask $$$f_i(x)$$$, print symbol \&quot;?\&quot; without quotes and then two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x \\leq 10^{18}$$$).

That is, if $$$A_i$$$ and $$$B_i$$$ trusted each other on day $$$i-1$$$, they did not trust each other on day $$$i$$$, or vice versa. Read all of these integers.\n\nThe interactor now will ask you $$$Q$$$ question, so the following interaction should happen $$$Q$$$ times:\n\n1. Read $$$3$$$ integers describing the current query: $$$x,y$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$x \\neq y$$$, $$$0 \\leq x,y < N$$$ and $$$0 \\leq v \\leq U$$$), where $$$x$$$ is the suspected Thief, $$$y$$$ is the suspected Evil Shaman, and $$$v$$$ is the suspected day..\n2. Then print the answer to this query on a single line, i.e. you should print the minimum distance the whispered formula had to travel from some trusted friend $$$x'$$$ of $$$x$$$ to a trusted friend $$$y'$$$ of $$$y$$$.   In case someone trusted both $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ (i.e. $$$x'=y'$$$), you should print $$$0$$$.  If $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$ had no trusted friends, print $$$10^9$$$.\n\nAfter printing each line do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

If you receive $$$0$$$ followed by $$$k$$$ integers $$$e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_k$$$, you have to print one integer indicating the color you choose during the move (of course, $$$e_i$$$ for that color should not be equal to $$$0$$$).\n\nDon't forget to flush the output every time you print something!&quot;:1,&quot;You can make no more than $$$10$$$ moves. To make a move, output \&quot;? $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x,y \\leq n$$$). In response to this, the jury's program will output a single integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ — the color of cell $$$(x,y)$$$.\n\nAfter all moves (it is not necessary to make all $$$10$$$ moves and it is not necessary to make at least one move), output a string in the format \&quot;! $$$x_1$$$ $$$x_2$$$ $$$y_1$$$ $$$y_2$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \\leq n, x_1 \\ne x_2, y_1 \\ne y_2$$$).

After that, proceed to the next test case or terminate the program if there are no more test cases left.\n\nOtherwise, if any of the specified cells are colored with the same color or one of the cells is not colored yet, the jury's program will output \&quot;ERROR\&quot;. In this case, your program should immediately terminate its execution to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive an arbitrary verdict.\n\nAfter each move or answer, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing any question.\n\nAfter each question, you should read the answer as mentioned in the legend.

Otherwise you may get any verdict, because the program will continue reading from the closed stream. Note that if the query is correct, the answer will never be $$$-1$$$ because $$$\\max(a_i, a_j, a_k) - \\min(a_i, a_j, a_k) \\geq 0$$$.\n\nTo give the final answer, print \&quot;! $$$i$$$ $$$j$$$\&quot; (without the quotes).

After that you should read a single line containing \&quot;YES\&quot; or \&quot;NO\&quot; depending on the answer of the query. \&quot;YES\&quot; means Bob can go from the cell $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ to the cell $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$, \&quot;NO\&quot; means the opposite.\n\nNote that the grid is fixed before the start of your solution and does not depend on your queries.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

Exit immediately after receiving \&quot;BAD\&quot; and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query print a single line:\n\n- In the beginning print \&quot;? c \&quot; (without quotes) where $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\leq c \\leq n)$$$ denotes the number of nodes being queried, followed by $$$c$$$ distinct integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the indices of nodes from the list.\n\nFor each query, you will receive two integers $$$x$$$, $$$d$$$ — the node (among the queried nodes) with the minimum sum of distances to the hidden nodes and the sum of distances from that node to the hidden nodes. If the subset of nodes queried is invalid or you exceeded the number of queries then you will get $$$x = d = -1$$$. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nWhen you have guessed the hidden nodes, print a single line \&quot;! \&quot; (without quotes), followed by two integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the hidden nodes. You can output the hidden nodes in any order.\n\nAfter this, you should read a string. If you guess the nodes correctly, you will receive the string \&quot;Correct\&quot;. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases or terminate the program, if all test cases were solved. Otherwise, you will receive the string \&quot;Incorrect\&quot;. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nGuessing the hidden nodes does not count towards the number of queries asked.\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive. The hidden nodes do not change with queries.\n\nDo not forget to read the string \&quot;Correct\&quot; / \&quot;Incorrect\&quot; after guessing the hidden nodes.\n\nYou need to solve each test case before receiving the input for the next test case.\n\nThe limit of $$$11$$$ queries applies to each test case and not to the entire input.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 1000)$$$ — the number of nodes in the tree. The second line should contain two distinct integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the hidden nodes. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\le u, v \\le n, u \\ne v)$$$  — the edges of the tree.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$), the number of test cases. The interaction for each testcase is described below:\n\nFirst, read an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 50$$$), the length of the string $$$p$$$.\n\nThen you can make queries of type \&quot;? s\&quot; ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le n$$$) to find the occurrences of $$$s$$$ as a substring of $$$p$$$.\n\nAfter the query, you need to read its result as a series of integers in a line:\n\n- The first integer $$$k$$$ denotes the number of occurrences of $$$s$$$ as a substring of $$$p$$$ ($$$-1 \\le k \\le n$$$). If $$$k = -1$$$, it means you have exceeded the energy limit or printed an invalid query, and you need to terminate immediately, to guarantee a \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict, otherwise you might get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n- The following $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_k \\le n$$$) denote the starting positions of the substrings that match the string $$$s$$$.\n\nWhen you find out the string $$$p$$$, print \&quot;! $$$p$$$\&quot; to finish a test case. This query doesn't consume any energy. The interactor will return an integer $$$1$$$ or $$$0$$$. If the interactor returns $$$1$$$, you can proceed to the next test case, or terminate the program if it was the last testcase.\n\nIf the interactor returns $$$0$$$, it means that your guess is incorrect, and you should to terminate to guarantee a \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict.\n\nNote that in every test case the string $$$p$$$ is fixed beforehand and will not change during the queries, i.e. the interactor is not adaptive.\n\nAfter printing any query do not forget to print end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you might get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nFor hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case:\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t = 1$$$).\n\nThe second line should contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the string's size.\n\nThe third line should contain a string of size $$$n$$$, consisting of characters \&quot;C\&quot;, \&quot;H\&quot; and \&quot;O\&quot; only. This is the string contestants will have to find out.&quot;:1,&quot;To query a line $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$ you should print \&quot;? a b c\&quot; where all a, b and c are real numbers up to $$$100$$$ by absolute value. For less precision issues numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ must satisfy the condition $$$|a| + |b| \\geq 0.1$$$, where $$$|a|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$a$$$.\n\nAs an answer to the query you will get $$$n$$$ points in the form \&quot;x_1 y_1 ... x_n y_n\&quot;, where points $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are projections to the line $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$. It is guaranteed that each printed point is no more than $$$10^{-4}$$$ away from the real projection point. Every coordinate is printed with at most 9 decimal places.\n\nSee the interaction example for more clarity.\n\nIf you ask too many queries, you will get Wrong answer.\n\nTo output an answer you should print \&quot;! x_1 y_1 ... x_n y_n\&quot;, where $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are coordinates of the hidden points. You could output the hidden points in any order. The answer would be considered correct if each of the printed points is no more than $$$10^{-3}$$$ away from the corresponding hidden point. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

In the next $$$n$$$ lines output two rational numbers each. The numbers in line $$$i$$$ should correspond to $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ respectively. Printed points must comply with all constraints from the input section.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question, print out three distinct integers a1, a2, a3. These integers should be between 1 and n, inclusive.\n\nThe judge will respond with a single character, either \&quot;X\&quot;, \&quot;Y\&quot;, \&quot;Z\&quot;.\n\nIf the string is \&quot;X\&quot; (or \&quot;Y\&quot;, \&quot;Z\&quot; respectively), that means the pair (a1, a2) (or (a2, a3), (a3, a1) respectively) has the deepest LCA among the three pairs.\n\nYou may only ask a question at most 10·n times, otherwise, you will get Wrong Answer.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print out a single integer \&quot;-1\&quot; on its own line. The next line should contain 2n - 1 integers. The i-th integer should be the parent of the i-th node, or -1, if it is the root. Do not forget to flush the final answer as well. Printing the answer does not count as asking a question.\n\nYou will get Wrong Answer verdict if\n\n- Your question or answers are not in the format described in this statement.\n- You ask strictly more than 10·n questions.\n- Your question contains duplicate indices.\n- Your final answer is not isomorphic to the judge tree.\n\nYou will get Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't print anything or if you forget to flush the output, including for the final answer (more info about flushing output below).\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nIf at any moment your program reads -1 as an answer, it should immediately exit normally (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get Wrong Answer in this case, it means that you made more queries than allowed, or made an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHacking To hack someone, use the following format\n\nThis denotes a tree where the parent of the i-th node is pi (pi =  - 1 or n < pi ≤ 2n - 1). If pi is equal to -1, then node i is the root. This input must describe a valid full rooted binary tree.\n\nOf course, contestant programs will not be able to see this input.&quot;:1,&quot;You begin the interaction by reading $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.\n\n- To ask your friend to taste a cup of coffee produced by the café $$$c$$$, in a separate line output? $$$c$$$Where $$$c$$$ must satisfy $$$1 \\le c \\le n$$$.

The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must have at least 1 and at most $$$30\\cdot n$$$ characters, and each character must be either X or O. We will denote the $$$i$$$-th magic word you printed as $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 1000$$$), the number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process $$$q$$$ times, one per student.\n\nFor the $$$j$$$-th student, it should first read a single integer $$$p_j$$$, the power of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two indices $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ independently and uniformly at random between 1 and $$$n$$$ inclusive, concatenating $$$w_{u_j}$$$ and $$$w_{v_j}$$$, and finding the number of different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program must print the numbers $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$, in this order ($$$1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n$$$).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student in the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after printing $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ for each student.&quot;:1,&quot;In order to query the area of intersection of a polygon with $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le k \\le 1000$$$) vertices at points with coordinates $$$(x_1, y_1),\\; \\dots ,\\;(x_k, y_k)$$$ with a square of poisoned corn print $$$k+1$$$ lines.

It is guaranteed that the rook wouldn't move to a square already occupied by another chess piece, but it can move onto the square where it was before the turn so that its position wouldn't change. It is guaranteed that the move does not put your king into a check. If your king got in check, all three integers would be equal to $$$-1$$$ and in that case your program should terminate immediately.\n\nAfter printing your turn do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

If there are several possible answers to the problem, you can output any of them.\n\nThere are several possible responses for a comparison:\n\n- '<' — if ai is less than aj,\n- '=' — if ai is equal to aj,\n- '>' — if ai is greater than aj.\n\nFor an array of length n your program can make at most $$f(n) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{3 \\cdot n}{2} \\right\\rceil - 2$$ comparisons. Note that the operation of reporting an answer («! i j» ) is not included into the value of f(n).\n\nAfter the answer is reported, your program has to solve the problem for the next array or it should terminate if all T arrays are processed.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$), the size of the list of integers.\n\nThen you can make queries of two types:\n\n- \&quot;? i\&quot; ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) — to get the value of $$$a_i$$$.\n- \&quot;> x\&quot; ($$$0 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — to check whether there exists an element greater than $$$x$$$\n\nAfter the query read its result $$$r$$$ as an integer.\n\n- For the first query type, the $$$r$$$ satisfies $$$0 \\le r \\le 10^9$$$.\n- For the second query type, the $$$r$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.\n- In case you make more than $$$60$$$ queries or violated the number range in the queries, you will get a $$$r = -1$$$.\n- If you terminate after receiving the -1, you will get the \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you find out what the smallest element $$$x_1$$$ and common difference $$$d$$$, print\n\n- \&quot;! $$$x_1$$$ $$$d$$$\&quot;\n\nAnd quit after that. This query is not counted towards the $$$60$$$ queries limit.\n\nAfter printing any query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nFor hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the list's size.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the list.\n\nAlso, after the sorting the list must form an arithmetic progression with positive common difference.&quot;:1,&quot;For each question, if you want to ask about a set $$$S$$$, first print the character '?', then print the size of $$$S$$$ and then print the elements of $$$S$$$ one by one. Each element should be an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, the elements must be distinct. After each question, read a string \&quot;YES\&quot; or \&quot;NO\&quot;, as explained in the statement. You can make at most $$$53$$$ such questions.\n\nIf you want to guess for $$$x$$$, first print the character '!' and then print your guess. After each guess, read \&quot;:)\&quot; or \&quot;:(\&quot;. If you guess $$$x$$$ correctly, the answer is \&quot;:)\&quot; and your program should terminate immediately, otherwise you'll receive \&quot;:(\&quot;. You can make at most $$$2$$$ such guesses.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacking is not allowed in this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;First, you need to read the number $$$n$$$, after that you can make queries.\n\nTo make a query, print two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$), then flush the output.\n\nAfter each query, read a single integer $$$ans$$$ ($$$0 \\leq ans \\leq 3$$$).\n\nIf $$$ans > 0$$$, then it is the number of the phrase said by Vasya.\n\nIf $$$ans = 0$$$, it means that you win and your program should terminate.\n\nIf you make more than $$$600$$$ queries or make an incorrect query, you will get Wrong Answer.\n\nYour solution will get Idleness Limit Exceeded, if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output.\n\nTo flush you need to do the following right after printing a query and a line end:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- For other languages see documentation.\n\nHacks format\n\nFor hacks, use the following format:\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the upper limit of the numbers.\n\nIn the second line, print two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$) — the numbers which Vasya thought of.\n\nIn the third line, print a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of instructions for the interactor.\n\nIn each of the next $$$m$$$ lines, print five integers: $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$r^{12}_i$$$, $$$r^{13}_i$$$, and $$$r^{23}_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$$$), where $$$r^{ST}_i$$$ equals to either number $$$S$$$ or number $$$T$$$.\n\nWhile answering the query $$$x\\,\\, y$$$, the interactor finds a number $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ with the minimal value $$$|x-x_i| + |y-y_i|$$$. If multiple numbers can be chosen, the least $$$i$$$ is preferred. Then the interactor answers to the query, but if there are two phrases $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ that can be given, then $$$r^{ST}_i$$$ is chosen.\n\nFor example, the sample test data file contains the following:&quot;:1,&quot;To perform a rotation, print on a single line \&quot;? x d\&quot; where $$$x$$$ $$$(0 \\leq x < n)$$$ is the ring that you wish to rotate and $$$d$$$ $$$(d \\in \\{-1,1\\})$$$ is the direction that you would like to rotate in. $$$d=1$$$ indicates a clockwise rotation by $$$1$$$ section while $$$d=-1$$$ indicates an anticlockwise rotation by $$$1$$$ section.\n\nFor each query, you will receive a single integer $$$a$$$: the number of lasers that are not blocked by any of the arcs after the rotation has been performed.\n\nOnce you have figured out the relative positions of the arcs, print ! followed by $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{n-1}$$$.\n\nDo note that the positions of the rings are predetermined for each test case and won't change during the interaction process.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded verdict.\n\nTo do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo hack, use the following format of test:\n\nThe first line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$.\n\nThe next line of should contain $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_{n-1}$$$: relative positions of rings $$$1,2,\\ldots,n-1$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;You can press buttons no more than 2·n·m times.\n\nTo press a button you should print \&quot;U\&quot;, \&quot;D\&quot;, \&quot;L\&quot;, \&quot;R\&quot; in new line. It’s necessary to print newline character and flush output. After flushing buffer you should read answer from input data. Answer is the pair of space-separated integers x, y — new position of player. In case, if there is no cell in direction of moving, position will not change. If after any move player lost, in other words player move to dangerous cell, then x and y will be equal to  - 1.\n\nIf after any move player is in finish or dangerous cell, then you should terminate your program.\n\nTo finish output buffer (i. e. for operation flush) right after printing direction and newline you should do next:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++\n- System.out.flush() in Java\n- stdout.flush() in Python\n- flush(output) in Pascal\n- read documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo perform a hack you should use this format:\n\nWhere n, m — number of rows and columns in game field. swapLR is equal to 1 in case, when directions \&quot;L’’ and \&quot;R’’ is swapped, and equal to 0 otherwise. swapUD is equal to 1, when directions \&quot;U’’ and \&quot;D’’ is swapped, and equal to 0 otherwise. a1, a2, ..., an — description of corresponding rows of game field.&quot;:1,&quot;You begin the interaction by reading a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n\\le 100$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n\nThen, you can make at most $$$25$$$ queries.\n\nEach query should begin with a line of the form ? r c, where r and c are the initial row and column of the box, respectively.\n\nThe next $$$n$$$ lines of the query should contain $$$n$$$ characters each. The $$$j$$$th character of the $$$i$$$th row should be one of '^', 'v', '<', or '>', indicating the direction of conveyor $$$(i, j)$$$ for this query.\n\nAfter each query, you will receive two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If $$$x = y = -1$$$, then the box entered an infinite loop. Otherwise, its final position was $$$(x, y)$$$.\n\nIf you make too many queries or make an invalid query, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter you have found the stuck conveyor and its direction, print a single line ! r c dir, where r and c are the row and column of the stuck conveyor, respectively, and dir is one of '^', 'v', '<', or '>', indicating the direction of the stuck conveyor. Note that printing this answer does not count towards your total of $$$25$$$ queries. After printing this line, your program should terminate.\n\nThe interactor is non-adaptive. This means that the location and direction of the stuck belt is fixed at the start of the interaction, and does not change after the queries.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n\nThe next line should contain two integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le r, c \\le n$$$), as well as a character $$$\\mathrm{dir}$$$ ($$$\\mathrm{dir}$$$ is one of '^', 'v', '<', '>') — the position of the stuck conveyor and its fixed direction. These values should be separated by spaces.&quot;:1,&quot;For each set of input data, read one integer $$$n$$$. You are allowed to make no more than $$$n + 5000$$$ queries.\n\nIf you want to make a query, output it in the format \&quot;? $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$\&quot;, where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the numbers of tubes for which you learn the lcm (least common multiple) of their lengths. Note that $$$1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\neq y$$$ must be satisfied. The interactor will return a single integer —the answer to your query.\n\nIf you are ready to print the answer, print it in the format \&quot;! $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ ... $$$a_n$$$\&quot;. The output of the answer is not considered a query and is not included in the number of queries.\n\nAfter each query and answer output, don't forget to output the line translation and reset the output buffer. Otherwise you will get the verdict \&quot;Idleness limit exceeded\&quot;. To reset the buffer use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nNote that the interactor is not adaptive. That is, the original permutation is fixed in the beginning and don't depend on your queries.\n\nHacks:\n\nUse the following format for hacks:\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$) — the number of input datasets. A description of the input data sets is given below.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) —the number of tubes. It is known that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, i.e. the lengths of the tubes do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers — the lengths of the tubes in each input dataset. Remember that $$$l \\le a_i \\le r$$$ and $$$r-l+1 = n$$$, and that all $$$a_i$$$ are different.&quot;:1,&quot;Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nTo ask a question, print \&quot;$$$k_1\\ k_2\\ a_1\\ a_2\\ \\ldots\\ a_{k_1}\\ b_1\\ b_2\\ \\ldots\\ b_{k_2}$$$\&quot; $$$(k_1, k_2 \\geq 1$$$ and $$$k_1+k_2 \\leq n$$$). These two sets must be nonempty and disjoint. The judge will respond with a single integer $$$\\max_{p,q} dist(a_p, b_q)$$$. If you ever get a result of $$$-1$$$ (because you printed an invalid query), exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print \&quot;$$$-1\\ d$$$\&quot;, where $$$d$$$ is the maximum shortest distance over all pairs of nodes.\n\nYou can only ask at most $$$9$$$ questions per test case.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t=1$$$).\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$).\n\nEach of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines should contain three integers $$$a_i, b_i, c_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i, b_i\\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq c_i \\leq 100$$$). This denotes an undirected edge between nodes $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ with weight $$$c_i$$$. These edges must form a tree.&quot;:1,&quot;To make a query, you should print ? x1 y1 x2 y2 ($$$1 \\leq x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq y_1 \\leq y_2 \\leq n$$$), representing a rectangle consisting of all cells $$$(x,y)$$$ such that $$$x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2$$$ and $$$y_1 \\leq y \\leq y_2$$$. You will get a single integer as the answer.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output, otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nAnswer $$$-1$$$ instead of a valid answer means that you made an invalid query or exceeded the maximum number of queries. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nIf your program cannot find out the head and tail of the snake correctly, you will also get a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, print a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$) in the first line, indicating the size of the grid.\n\nThen print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq k \\leq n^2$$$) in the second line, indicating the length of the snake.\n\nIn the next $$$k$$$ lines, print $$$k$$$ pairs of integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$$$), each pair in a single line, indicating the $$$i$$$-th cell of snake, such that the adjacent pairs are adjacent, and all $$$k$$$ pairs are distinct.&quot;:1,&quot;Interaction is happening through queries.\n\nEach request consists of a single non-empty string $$$t$$$  — the spell you want to cast. The length of string $$$t$$$ should not exceed $$$300$$$. Each string should consist only of the letters a and b.\n\nIn response to the query, you will get resistance runes  — the edit distance between the strings that specify the casted spell $$$t$$$ and the secret rune-destroying spell $$$s$$$. Remember that $$$s$$$ contains only the letters a and b.\n\nAfter breaking the rune, your program should end immediately. A rune is destroyed when you get a response with resistance $$$0$$$. After receiving the value $$$0$$$, your program should terminate normally.\n\nIn this problem interactor is not adaptive. This means that during any test the rune-destroying spell $$$s$$$ does not change.\n\nIf your query is invalid, -1 will be returned. After receiving this your program should immediately terminate normally (for example, by calling exit(0)), otherwise, the testing system may issue an arbitrary verdict.\n\nIf the number of spells exceeds limit ($$$n + 2$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the length of the spell $$$s$$$, which is unknown to you), you will get the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nYour solution may receive the verdict Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't output anything or forget to flush the output buffer.\n\nTo flush the output buffer, you need to do the following immediately after printing the query and the line end:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- for other languages see documentation.\n\nHacks\n\nFor hacks, use the following format:\n\nIn a single line print the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 300$$$) of letters a and b, which defines the rune-destroying spell.\n\nThe hacked solution will not have direct access to the unknown spell.&quot;:1,&quot;Start the interaction by reading single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$)  — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \&quot;$$$? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \\ldots \\enspace a_n$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq a_j \\leq n$$$).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer $$$k$$$ as described above ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n$$$).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \&quot;$$$! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \\ldots \\enspace p_n$$$\&quot; then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most $$$2n$$$ queries. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$), then output another line containing the hidden permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;From the technical side, this problem is interactive. However, it should not affect you (except hacking) since there is no interaction.&quot;:1,&quot;В первой строке записано два числа $$$n$$$ и $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100, 1 \\le S \\le 5$$$) — количество пользователей для которых необходимо независимо решить задачу, а также количество серверов, на которых хранятся посты.\n\nДалее необходимо $$$n$$$ раз решить задачу. Вначале необходимо считать $$$S$$$ чисел $$$a_1, a_2, ... a_S$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i; \\sum a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — количество постов пользователя на каждом сервере. В следующей строке будет задано число $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le \\sum a_i $$$) — идентификатор какого по возрастанию поста необходимо узнать.\n\nДалее необходимо совершить не более 100 запросов в формате, который описан в условии.\n\nЗаметим, что ограничение на количество запросов действует на каждого пользователя отдельно, поэтому при переходе к следующему тесту счетчик вопросов сбрасывается.&quot;:1,&quot;In the first line you will be given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \\le n \\le 10^4, 1 \\le k \\le n)$$$, which are the number of items in the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$.\n\nAfter that, you can ask no more than $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ questions (not including the \&quot;finish\&quot; operation).\n\nEach line of your output may be of one of the following types:\n\n- \&quot;or i j\&quot; $$$(1 \\le i, j \\le n, i \\neq j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise OR.\n- \&quot;and i j\&quot; $$$(1 \\le i, j \\le n, i \\neq j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise AND.\n- \&quot;finish res\&quot;, where $$$res$$$ is the $$$k$$$th smallest number in the sequence. After outputting this line the program execution must conclude.\n\nIn response to the first two types of queries, you will get an integer $$$x$$$, the result of the operation for the numbers you have selected.\n\nAfter outputting a line do not forget to output a new line character and flush the output buffer. Otherwise you will get the \&quot;Idleness limit exceeded\&quot;. To flush the buffer use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++\n- System.out.flush() in Java\n- stdout.flush() in Python\n- flush(output) in Pascal\n- for other languages refer to documentation\n\nIf you perform an incorrect query the response will be $$$-1$$$. After receiving response $$$-1$$$ you must immediately halt your program in order to receive an \&quot;Incorrect answer\&quot; verdict.\n\nHacking\n\nTo perform a hack you will need to use the following format:\n\nThe first line must contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \\le n \\le 10^4, 1 \\le k \\le n)$$$, which are the number of items in the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$.\n\nThe second line must contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)$$$, the sequence $$$a$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To give a command to move the friends, print \&quot;next\&quot; and then space-separated indices of the friends you want to move. For example, to give the command to move the friends with indices $$$0$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$9$$$ print \&quot;next 0 2 5 9\&quot;. At each turn, you must move at least one of your friends.\n\nAs an answer, first read an integer $$$k$$$, and then $$$10$$$ digits divided into $$$k$$$ space-separated groups. The friends that correspond to the indices in the same group are in the same vertex. The friends that correspond to indices in different groups are in different vertices. The indices in each group follow in ascending order.\n\nFor example, the answer \&quot;2 05 12346789\&quot; means that the friends with indices $$$0$$$ and $$$5$$$ are in one vertex, and all other friends are in the same but different vertex. The answer \&quot;4 01 567 234 89\&quot; means that Misha's friends are in four different vertices: the friends with indices $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ are in the first, the friends with indices $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$ are in the second, the friends with indices $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ are in the third, and the friends with indices $$$8$$$ and $$$9$$$ are in the fourth.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nAnswer \&quot;stop\&quot; instead of a valid one means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving \&quot;stop\&quot; and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHacks\n\nIn order to hack, print two integers $$$t$$$ and $$$c$$$ in a single line ($$$1 \\le t, c$$$, $$$(t+c) \\leq 1000$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;You can ask the rocket no more than $$$60$$$ questions.\n\nTo ask a question, print a number $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le y\\le m$$$) and an end-of-line character, then do the operation flush and read the answer to the question.\n\nIf the program reads $$$0$$$, then the distance is correct and you must immediately terminate the program (for example, by calling exit(0)). If you ignore this, you can get any verdict, since your program will continue to read from the closed input stream.\n\nIf at some point your program reads $$$-2$$$ as an answer, it must immediately end (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive the \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict, and this will mean that the request is incorrect or the number of requests exceeds $$$60$$$. If you ignore this, you can get any verdict, since your program will continue to read from the closed input stream.\n\nIf your program's request is not a valid integer between $$$-2^{31}$$$ and $$$2^{31}-1$$$ (inclusive) without leading zeros, then you can get any verdict.\n\nYou can get \&quot;Idleness limit exceeded\&quot; if you don't print anything or if you forget to flush the output.\n\nTo flush the output buffer you can use (after printing a query and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacking\n\nUse the following format for hacking:\n\nIn the first line, print $$$3$$$ integers $$$m,n,x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le m\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1\\le n\\le 30$$$) — the maximum distance to Mars, the number of elements in the sequence $$$p$$$ and the current distance to Mars.\n\nIn the second line, enter $$$n$$$ numbers, each of which is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ — sequence $$$p$$$.\n\nThe hacked solution will not have access to the number $$$x$$$ and sequence $$$p$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;Begin the interaction by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$) on a separate line.\n\nTo ask a query, print a line in the form $$$\\texttt{?}\\;\\;l\\;\\;r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$). Then you should read a single line containing the answer to your query.\n\nAfter you have determined the answer, print a line in the form $$$\\texttt{!}\\;\\;x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is the minimum value.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.

To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nAnswer $$$\\texttt{-1}$$$ means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $$$\\texttt{-1}$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.&quot;:1,&quot;After reading the input data, one can start making queries. There are two possible queries:\n\n1. \&quot;? $$$u$$$ $$$v$$$\&quot; — to ask for an edge $$$(u, v)$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$) which of the endpoints is closer to the special vertex. The answer to this query is one of the endpoints. Note that, $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ must be connected by an edge, and hence they can not have the same distance to the special vertex.\n2. \&quot;! $$$u$$$\&quot; — to indicate that you found the special vertex. After the program does that, it must immediately terminate.\n\nDo not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded verdict. To flush the output, you can use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIn case you ask more queries than needed in the worst case for a given tree, you will get verdict Wrong answer.&quot;:1,&quot;Your program should play several games.\n\nBefore the start of any game your program should read the string:\n\n- \&quot;start\&quot; (without quotes) — the start of the new game.\n- \&quot;mistake\&quot; (without quotes) — in the previous game, you found the wrong answer. Your program should terminate after reading this string and it will get verdict \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n- \&quot;end\&quot; (without quotes) — all games finished. Your program should terminate after reading this string.\n\nAfter reading the string \&quot;start\&quot; (without quotes) the new game starts.\n\nAt the beginning, your program should ask several questions about pairs of non-negative integer numbers $$$(x, y)$$$. You can only ask the numbers, that satisfy the inequalities $$$0 \\leq x, y \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$. To ask a question print \&quot;? x y\&quot; (without quotes). As the answer, you should read one symbol:\n\n- \&quot;x\&quot; (without quotes), if $$$(x \\bmod a) \\geq (y \\bmod a)$$$.\n- \&quot;y\&quot; (without quotes), if $$$(x \\bmod a) < (y \\bmod a)$$$.\n- \&quot;e\&quot; (without quotes) — you asked more than $$$60$$$ questions. Your program should terminate after reading this string and it will get verdict \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n\nAfter your program asked several questions your program should print the answer in form \&quot;! a\&quot; (without quotes). You should print the number $$$a$$$ satisfying the inequalities $$$1 \\leq a \\leq 10^9$$$. It's guaranteed that Petya's number $$$a$$$ satisfied this condition. After that, the current game will finish.\n\nWe recall that your program can't ask more than $$$60$$$ questions during one game.\n\nIf your program doesn't terminate after reading \&quot;mistake\&quot; (without quotes), \&quot;end\&quot; (without quotes) or \&quot;e\&quot; (without quotes), it can get any verdict, because it will continue reading from closed input. Also, if your program prints answer or question in the incorrect format it can get any verdict, too. Be careful.\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing questions and answers.\n\nTo flush the output, you can use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++.\n- System.out.flush() in Java.\n- stdout.flush() in Python.\n- flush(output) in Pascal.\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nIt's guaranteed that you should play at least $$$1$$$ and no more than $$$100$$$ games.\n\nHacks:\n\nIn hacks, you can use only one game. To hack a solution with Petya's number $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a \\leq 10^9$$$) in the first line you should write a single number $$$1$$$ and in the second line you should write a single number $$$a$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;For each test case, the interaction starts with reading $$$n$$$.\n\nThen you are allowed to make at most $$$n+6$$$ questions in the following way:\n\n\&quot;? a b c\&quot; ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are pairwise distinct).\n\nAfter each one, you should read an integer $$$r$$$, which is equal to $$$0$$$ if there are more impostors than crewmates among players labelled $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, and equal to $$$1$$$ otherwise.\n\nAnswer $$$-1$$$ instead of $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you have found the indices of all impostors, print a single line \&quot;! \&quot; (without quotes), followed by the number of impostors $$$k$$$, followed by $$$k$$$ integers representing the indices of the impostors. Please note that you must print all this information on the same line.\n\nAfter printing the answer, your program must then continue to solve the remaining test cases, or exit if all test cases have been solved.\n\nAfter printing the queries and answers do not forget to output end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will get the Idleness limit exceeded verdict. To do flush use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- Read documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nYou cannot make hacks in this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;You start the interaction by reading the number $$$n$$$.\n\nTo ask a query about a substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), you should output\n\n? l r\n\non a separate line. After this, all substrings of $$$s[l..r]$$$ will be returned in random order, each substring exactly once. In every returned substring all characters will be randomly shuffled.\n\nIn the case, if you ask an incorrect query, ask more than $$$3$$$ queries of the first type or there will be more than $$$(n+1)^2$$$ substrings returned in total, you will receive verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo guess the string $$$s$$$, you should output\n\n! s\n\non a separate line.\n\nAfter printing each query, do not forget to flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To flush the output, you can use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIf you received - (dash) as an answer to any query, you need to terminate your program with exit code 0 (for example, by calling exit(0)). This means that there was an error in the interaction protocol. If you don't terminate with exit code 0, you can receive any unsuccessful verdict.\n\nHack format\n\nTo hack a solution, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the string, and the following line should contain the string $$$s$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;After reading $$$n$$$, you can start making queries to the grading system. For each query, print a line containing a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only letters 'T' and 'F'.\n\n- $$$s_i = $$$'T' means that you answer the $$$i$$$-question true.\n- $$$s_i = $$$'F' means that you answer the $$$i$$$-question false.\n\nAfter a successful query, you should read an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\leq k\\leq n$$$) — the number of correct answers. If you read $$$n$$$, then you found the answers, and your program should not make any more queries.\n\nIf your program reads $$$k = -1$$$ instead of the number of correct answers, it means that you either made an invalid query or exceeded the query limits. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$, and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of questions.\n\nThe second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only 'T' and 'F' — the answer key.&quot;:1,&quot;To make a query to the system, output ? $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is a string of no more than $$$50$$$ characters in length, the hash of which you want to know. In response to this query, you will receive the polynomial hash of the string $$$s$$$.\n\nTo output the answer, output ! $$$p$$$ $$$m$$$, where $$$p$$$ is the base of the hash, and $$$m$$$ is the modulus. After that, immediately proceed to the next test case.\n\nYou have to make not more than $$$3$$$ queries ?, otherwise you will get verdict Wrong Answer.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit exceeded. To flush the buffer, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.&quot;:1,&quot;First read a line containing a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 2048$$$) denoting the number of independent test cases that you must solve.\n\nFor each test case, first read a line containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$). Then you may ask up to $$$\\lceil\\log_{1.116}{n}\\rceil-1$$$ queries.\n\nTo ask a query, print a single line in the format \&quot;? l r\&quot; (without quotes) $$$(1\\leq l\\leq r\\leq n)$$$. Then read a single line containing a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$r-l\\leq x\\leq r-l+1$$$) denoting the number of students who raised their hands corresponding to the query.\n\nTo mark a student as absent, print a single line in the format \&quot;! a\&quot; (without quotes) $$$(1\\leq a\\leq n)$$$. Then read a single integer $$$y$$$ ($$$y\\in\\{0,1\\}$$$). If the student with roll number $$$a$$$ was absent, $$$y=1$$$, else, $$$y=0$$$. Note that this operation does not count as a query but you can do this operation at most $$$2$$$ times.\n\nTo end a test case, print a single line in the format \&quot;#\&quot; (without quotes). Then you must continue solving the remaining test cases.\n\nIf you ask more queries than allowed or ask an invalid query, you will get the Wrong answer verdict.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nAfter printing the answers, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will get the verdict Idleness limit exceeded. To flush the buffer, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- Read documentation for other languages.\n\nNote that the grader for this problem is adaptive meaning that the answer may change depending on your queries but will always remain consistent with the constraints and the answer to the previous queries.\n\nInput format for Hacks\n\nThe test cases for this problem use both non-adaptive and adaptive graders. You can use the non-adaptive grader for making hacks.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 2048$$$).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$g$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ where $$$g=1$$$ (to identify that this test case must use the non-adaptive grader), $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$) represents the number of students in the class and $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\leq x\\leq n$$$) represents the roll number of the student who is absent. You must ensure that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string $$$S$$$ ($$$1\\leq\\vert S\\vert\\leq 120, S_i\\in \\{\\texttt{T},\\texttt{F}\\}$$$). This string represents the pattern of the truth sequence. If $$$S_{(i-1)\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1}= \\texttt{T}$$$, the students will act honestly during the $$$i$$$-th query, otherwise they will act dishonestly. You must also ensure that there is no index $$$i$$$ such that $$$S_{(i-1)\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1} = S_{i\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1} = S_{(i+1)\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1}$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;After you have read the description of the input data set, you must make no more than $$$5$$$ queries. Reading the input data is considered the beginning of the first stage, and the mimic may already begin to change.\n\nThe request is a line. The first character of the line indicates the request type. To remove objects, print \&quot;-\&quot;. After that print the number $$$k$$$ — how many objects you want to remove. Then there are $$$k$$$ numbers — indexes of objects in their current location. Indexing starts from one. You can remove the mimic, but in this case you will not be able to point to it and will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict.\n\nIn response to the request you will receive a line containing integers — the objects remaining in the room after removal and mixing.\n\nTo indicate the position of a mimic, print \&quot;!\&quot;, then print the index of the object that is the mimic.\n\nThe task will be considered solved if the position of the mimic is specified correctly.\n\nIf you make more than five requests, or make an invalid request, the solution will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict.\n\nAfter outputting a query or the answer do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get \&quot;Idleness limit exceeded\&quot;. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nYou can hack a solution with the following input format.\n\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 1000)$$$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 200, 1 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the number of objects and the position of the mimic.\n\nThe second line contains of each test case $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$,...,$$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 9$$$) – initial array of objects.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nThen, make at most $$$2n$$$ queries:\n\n- If you want to make a type $$$1$$$ query, output \&quot;+ x\&quot;. $$$x$$$ must be an integer between $$$2$$$ and $$$2n$$$ inclusive. After doing that read $$$1$$$ or $$$-2$$$. If you read $$$1$$$ your query was valid, otherwise it was invalid or you exceed the limit of queries, and your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n- If you want to make a type $$$2$$$ query, output \&quot;? i j\&quot;. $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ must be integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive. After that, read in a single integer $$$r$$$ ($$$-1 \\le r \\le n$$$) — the answer to your query. If you receive the integer $$$−2$$$ instead of an answer, it means your program has made an invalid query, or has exceeded the limit of queries. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAt any point of the interaction, if you want to guess two permutations, output \&quot;! $$$p_{1,1}$$$ $$$p_{1,2}$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$p_{1,n}$$$ $$$p_{2,1}$$$ $$$p_{2,2}$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$p_{2,n}$$$\&quot;. Note that you should output the two permutations on the same line, and no exclamation mark is needed to separate the two permutations. After doing that read $$$1$$$ or $$$-2$$$. If you read $$$1$$$ your answer was correct, otherwise it was incorrect and your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. After that, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there are none. Note that reporting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nNote that even if you output a correct permutation, the second permutation should be a permutation and not an arbitrary array.\n\nAt any point, if you continue interaction after reading in the integer $$$-2$$$, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nInteractor is non-adaptive. This means that all permutations are fixed before the interaction starts.\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$) — the length of the permutation.\n\nThe second line of each test case should contain $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the hidden permutation.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$10^3$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with reading a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$), the number of vertices of the tree.\n\nThen you will read $$$n-1$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them has two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$, $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$), denoting there is an edge connecting vertices $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the edges will form a tree.\n\nThen you can make queries of type \&quot;? u v\&quot; ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$) to find the lowest common ancestor of vertex $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.\n\nAfter the query, read the result $$$w$$$ as an integer.\n\nIn case your query is invalid or you asked more than $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$ queries, the program will print $$$-1$$$ and will finish interaction. You will receive a Wrong answer verdict. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nWhen you find out the vertex $$$r$$$, print \&quot;! $$$r$$$\&quot; and quit after that. This query does not count towards the $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$ limit.\n\nNote that the tree is fixed beforehand and will not change during the queries, i.e. the interactor is not adaptive.\n\nAfter printing any query do not forget to print end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you might get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$, $$$1 \\le r \\le n$$$), denoting the number of vertices and the vertex with Kuroni's hotel.\n\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$) — denoting there is an edge connecting vertex $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$.\n\nThe edges presented should form a tree.&quot;:1,&quot;Interaction in each test case starts after reading the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4$$$) — the length of permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$.\n\nTo get the value of $$$q_i$$$, output the query in the format $$$?$$$ $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). After that you will receive the value of $$$q_i$$$.\n\nYou can make at most $$$2n$$$ queries. After the incorrect query you will receive $$$0$$$ and you should exit immediately to get Wrong answer verdict.\n\nWhen you will be ready to determine $$$p$$$, output $$$p$$$ in format $$$!$$$ $$$p_1$$$ $$$p_2$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$p_n$$$. After this you should go to the next test case or exit if it was the last test case. Printing the permutation is not counted as one of $$$2n$$$ queries.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^4$$$. The interactor is not adaptive in this problem.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ — the length of the permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ — the hidden permutation for this test case.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction will begin with a line containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 25$$$), the amount of rows and columns in the grid. Read it.\n\nYour program should then print $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$x$$$-th line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{x,1}, a_{x,2}, \\dotsc, a_{x,n}$$$ satisfying $$$0 \\leq a_{x,y} \\leq 10^{16}$$$, where $$$a_{x,y}$$$ is the amount of uninteresting problems Omkar should place in the cell $$$(x, y)$$$.\n\nAfter that, you will first receive a single integer $$$q$$$, the amount of journeys that the duck will take. $$$q$$$ queries will follow; each query will consist of a single line containing an integer $$$k$$$, the amount of uninteresting problems that the duck ate on that journey. After each query, given that you have determined that the duck visited the cells $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dotsc, (x_{2n - 1}, y_{2n - 1})$$$ in that order (it should always be true that $$$(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)$$$ and $$$(x_{2n - 1}, y_{2n - 1}) = (n, n)$$$), you should output $$$2n - 1$$$ lines so that the $$$j$$$-th line contains the two integers $$$x_j, y_j$$$.\n\nBear in mind that if the sum on your path is $$$k$$$, but your path is different from the actual hidden path, then your solution is still wrong!\n\nAfter printing each line do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing $$$n$$$ and another line containing $$$q$$$. It must be true that $$$2 \\leq n \\leq 25$$$ and $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 1000$$$. Then, output the $$$q$$$ journeys taken by the duck in the same format as described above: for each journey, given that the duck visited the cells $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dotsc, (x_{2n - 1}, y_{2n - 1})$$$ in that order, you should output $$$2n - 1$$$ lines so that the $$$j$$$-th line contains the two integers $$$x_j, y_j$$$. It must be true that $$$(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)$$$ and $$$(x_{2n - 1}, y_{2n - 1}) = (n, n)$$$. Additionally, for each $$$j$$$ such that $$$2 \\leq j \\leq 2n - 1$$$, it must be true that $$$1 \\leq x_j, y_j \\leq n$$$ and either $$$(x_j, y_j) = (x_{j - 1} + 1, y_{j - 1})$$$ or $$$(x_j, y_j) = (x_{j - 1}, y_{j - 1} + 1)$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query, you should send one line containing the query, in one of the following formats:\n\n- ? 1 i — for a query of the first type ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$);\n- ? 2 l r — for a query of the second type ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$).\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after sending the query line.\n\nThe answer to your query will be given on a separate line. For a query of the first type, the answer will be the character $$$s_i$$$. For a query of the second type, the answer will be an integer equal to the number of different characters among $$$s_l, s_{l+1}, \\dots, s_r$$$.\n\nYou are allowed to ask no more than $$$26$$$ queries of the first type, and no more than $$$6000$$$ queries of the second type.\n\nIn case you ask too many queries, or the jury program fails to recognize your query format, the answer to your query will be one integer $$$0$$$. After receiving $$$0$$$ as the answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict \&quot;Runtime error\&quot;, \&quot;Time limit exceeded\&quot; or some other verdict instead of \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nTo make a query, output \&quot;? i j\&quot; without quotes ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$). If vertex $$$i$$$ is reachable from vertex $$$j$$$, you will get YES as an answer. Otherwise, you will get NO as an answer.\n\nIf you receive the integer $$$-1$$$ instead of an answer or a valid value of $$$n$$$, it means your program has made an invalid query, has exceeded the limit of queries, or has given an incorrect answer on the previous test case. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you are ready to give the final answer, output \&quot;! $$$c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \\ldots \\ c_n$$$\&quot; without quotes — the colors of the vertices, where $$$c_i = 0$$$ if the vertex is black, and $$$c_i = 1$$$ if the vertex is white. After solving all test cases, your program should be terminated immediately.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le \\frac{n\\cdot(n - 1)}{2}$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.\n\nEach of the following $$$m$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le b < a \\le n$$$), indicating that there is the edge $$$a \\rightarrow b$$$ in the graph. The graph should satisfy the conditions above.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$1000$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask about xor of two elements, print a string \&quot;? i j\&quot;, where i and j — are integers from 0 to n - 1 — the index of the permutation element and the index of the inverse permutation element you want to know the xor-sum for. After that print a line break and make flush operation.\n\nAfter printing the query your program should read single integer — the value of $$p_i \\oplus b_j$$.\n\nFor a permutation of length n your program should make no more than 2n queries about xor-sum. Note that printing answer doesn't count as a query. Note that you can't ask more than 2n questions. If you ask more than 2n questions or at least one incorrect question, your solution will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n\nIf at some moment your program reads -1 as an answer, it should immediately exit (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; in this case, it means that you asked more than 2n questions, or asked an invalid question. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution will get \&quot;Idleness Limit Exceeded\&quot;, if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output, including for the final answer .\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing line break):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- For other languages see the documentation.\n\nHacking\n\nFor hacking use the following format:\n\nn\n\np0 p1 ... pn - 1\n\nContestant programs will not be able to see this input.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction between your program and the jury's program begins with reading two positive even integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq k^2 \\leq 2500$$$) – the length of the chosen array and the length of the query subarray, respectively.\n\nTo find the value of $$$a_i \\oplus a_{i + 1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{i + k - 1}$$$, print the query in the format $$$?$$$ $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - k + 1$$$). Then read a single integer – the answer to your query.\n\nYou can make no more than $$$57$$$ queries. When you are ready to print the answer, output it in the format $$$!$$$ $$$x$$$. After that, proceed to process the next test case or terminate the program if it was the last test case. Printing the answer does not count as one of the $$$57$$$ queries.\n\nIf your program makes more than $$$57$$$ queries for one set of input data, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be -1. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo perform a hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ – the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of each test case should consist of two lines. The first line contains the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ – the length of the chosen array and the length of the query subarray, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ – the array that the jury should choose for this test case.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask the direction of the green edge between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, print \&quot;?\&quot;, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in single line, separated by the space characters.\n\nIn answer to this read a single integer, which will be $$$1$$$ if the edge is directed from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ and $$$0$$$ if the edge is directed from $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$.\n\nYou can ask at most $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ queries, otherwise you will get Wrong Answer.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nAnswer $$$-1$$$ instead of $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ means that you made an invalid query or exceeded the query limit. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHacks\n\nHacks should be formatted as follows.\n\nThe first line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 300$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le n \\cdot (n - 1) / 2$$$) — the number of nodes and number of pink edges.\n\nThe next $$$m$$$ lines should describe the pink edges, the $$$i$$$-th line should contain 2 integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$$$, $$$a_i \\ne b_i$$$), which means that there is a pink edge from $$$a_i$$$ to $$$b_i$$$. All unordered pairs $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ should be distinct.\n\nThe next $$$(n \\cdot (n - 1) / 2 - m)$$$ lines should describe the green edges, the $$$i$$$-th line should contain two integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$$$, $$$a_i \\ne b_i$$$)), which means that there is a green edge from $$$a_i$$$ to $$$b_i$$$. All unordered pairs of $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ should be distinct and should also be different from the pairs for the pink edges.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction begins by reading the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.\n\nAfter reading the integers, print a single line containing either \&quot;First\&quot; or \&quot;Second\&quot;, denoting who you want to play as (as first or second correspondently).\n\nOn each turn, the first player (either you or the judge) must print a positive integer $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le y \\le 10^{12}$$$).\n\nThen, the second player must print $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, or $$$3$$$, indicating which pile should have $$$y$$$ stones added to it. From the second turn onwards, the pile that the second player chooses must be different from the pile that they chose on the previous turn.\n\nIf you are playing as Second and complete $$$1000$$$ turns without losing, or if you are playing as First and the judge has determined that it cannot make a move without losing, the interactor will print $$$0$$$ and will finish interaction. This means that your program is correct for this test case, and you should exit immediately.\n\nIf you are playing as First and complete $$$1000$$$ turns without winning, or if you are playing as Second and print a move that makes two piles have the same number of stones, or if you output an invalid move as either player, the interactor will print $$$-1$$$ and will finish interaction. You will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nAfter printing something do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nIn this problem, hacks are disabled.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query print a single line:\n\n- In the beginning print \&quot;? c \&quot; (without quotes) where $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\leq c \\leq n)$$$ denotes the size of the subset of indices being queried, followed by $$$c$$$ distinct space-separated integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$.\n\nFor each query, you will receive an integer $$$x$$$ — the maximum of value in the array among all the indices queried. If the subset of indices queried is invalid or you exceeded the number of queries (for example one of the indices is greater than $$$n$$$) then you will get $$$x = -1$$$. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nWhen you have guessed the password, print a single line \&quot;! \&quot; (without quotes), followed by $$$k$$$ space-separated integers  — the password sequence.\n\nGuessing the password does not count towards the number of queries asked.\n\nAfter this, you should read a string. If you guess the password correctly, you will receive the string \&quot;Correct\&quot;. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If the guessed password is incorrect, you will receive the string \&quot;Incorrect\&quot;. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive. The array $$$A$$$ does not change with queries.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack the solution use the following test format:\n\nThe first line of the input should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10)$$$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(2 \\leq n \\leq 1000, 1 \\leq k \\leq n)$$$ — the size of the array and the number of subsets. The next line should consist of $$$n$$$ space separated integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$ — the array $$$A$$$. $$$k$$$ lines should follow. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain an integer $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\leq c \\lt n)$$$ — the size of subset $$$S_i$$$, followed by $$$c$$$ distinct integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — indices from the subset $$$S_i$$$.\n\nThe intersection of any two subsets has to be empty.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query, print a line in the format \&quot;? u k |S| S_1 S_2 ... S_|S|\&quot; with $$$1 \\leq u, S_1, \\ldots, S_{|S|} \\leq n$$$, all the $$$S_i$$$ distinct, and $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$.\n\nAs a response to the query you will get \&quot;1\&quot; if the answer is yes, and \&quot;0\&quot; if the answer is no.\n\nTo output an answer, you should print \&quot;! |A| A_1 A_2 ... A_|A|\&quot; with $$$1 \\leq A_1, \\ldots, A_{|A|} \\leq n$$$ all distinct. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.\n\nSee the interaction example for more clarity.\n\nIf you ask too many queries or you ask a malformed query, you will get Wrong answer.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHack format\n\nFor the hacks use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain $$$n$$$ — the number of rooms.\n\nThe second line should contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ — the teleporter in room $$$i$$$ leads to room $$$a_i$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;While helping Leha, you can ask queries to Noora no more than 60 times. Each query should be printed in it's own line and have the form 1 x y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n). You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read the answer for this query from input.\n\nAfter each query jury's program will print one line «TAK» or «NIE» (without quotes) in input stream depending on the girl's answer.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacking\n\nFor hacking you should write numbers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105) in the first line and, for describing dishes Noora ordered, k different integers a1, a2, ..., ak (1 ≤ ai ≤ n), written in ascending order in the second line. Of course, solution you want to hack won't be able to read the numbers of ordered dishes.&quot;:1,&quot;First, your program must read two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$t=1$$$).\n\nThen $$$t$$$ lines follow, each of which contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that at the moment of the request the array contains at least $$$k$$$ zeros. In order to get the next value of $$$k$$$, you must output the answer for the current value of $$$k$$$.\n\nAfter that, you can make no more than $$$20$$$ requests.\n\nUse the following format to output the answer (it is not a request, it doesn't count in $$$20$$$):\n\n- ! $$$x$$$ — position of the $$$k$$$-th zero.\n\nPositions in the array are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ inclusive.\n\nAfter printing $$$t$$$ answers, your program should exit immediately.\n\nIn this task, the interactor is not adaptive. This means that within the same test, the hidden array and the queries do not change.\n\nIn case of an incorrect query, -1 will be displayed. When this value is received, your program must immediately exit normally (for example, by calling exit(0)), otherwise, the testing system may issue an arbitrary verdict.\n\nIf the number of requests is exceeded, the verdict wrong answer will be displayed.\n\nYour solution may get the verdict Idleness limit exceeded if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output buffer.\n\nTo flush the output buffer, you need to do the following immediately after the query output and the end-of-line character:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C ++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nUse the following format for hacks:\n\nOn the first line print the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of zeros and ones, and an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t = 1$$$) — hidden array and number of requests, respectively. In the next $$$t$$$ lines output the number $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le |s|$$$).\n\nThe hacked solution will not have direct access to the hidden array.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction begins by reading a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 100$$$) — the size of the grid.\n\nThe turns of the game follow. You should begin each turn by reading an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1\\le a\\le 3$$$) — Alice's chosen color.\n\nThen you must print three integers $$$b,i,j$$$ ($$$1\\le b\\le 3,b\\ne a, 1\\le i,j\\le n$$$) — denoting that Bob puts a token of color $$$b$$$ in the cell $$$(i, j)$$$. The cell $$$(i, j)$$$ must not contain a token from a previous turn. If your move is invalid or loses the game, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter $$$n^2$$$ turns have been completed, make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting unexpected verdicts.\n\nAfter printing something do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 100$$$).\n\nThe second line contains $$$n^2$$$ integers $$$a_1,\\ldots,a_{n^2}$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 3$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes Alice's color on the $$$i$$$-th turn.\n\nThe interactor might deviate from the list of colors in your hack, but only if it forces Bob to lose.&quot;:1,&quot;Before submitting the answer, you may ask up to $$$4$$$ queries. To ask a query, print one line in the following format: $$$?$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$j$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ should be two integers such that $$$1 \\le i, j \\le 6$$$. The line should be ended with a line break character. After submitting a query, flush the output and read the answer to your query — one line containing one integer $$$a_i \\cdot a_j$$$. If you submit an incorrect query (or ask more than $$$4$$$ queries), the answer to it will be one string 0. After receiving such an answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict \&quot;Runtime error\&quot;, \&quot;Time limit exceeded\&quot; or some other verdict instead of \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n\nTo give the answer, your program should print one line $$$!$$$ $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ $$$a_3$$$ $$$a_4$$$ $$$a_5$$$ $$$a_6$$$ with a line break in the end. After that, it should flush the output and terminate gracefully.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask number of inversions on a subsegment $$$[l, r]$$$, print \&quot;? l r\&quot;, where ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$). You can ask at most $$$40$$$ questions in each test case. As a result you should read a single integer $$$x$$$.\n\n- If $$$x = -1$$$, your program made an invalid question or you exceeded the number of questions for that test case. Your program should terminate immediately (otherwise it can get any verdict instead of \&quot;Wrong Answer\&quot;).\n- Otherwise $$$x$$$ is equal to the number of inversions on the subsegment $$$[l, r]$$$ of the sequence $$$a$$$.\n\nTo give the answer, print \&quot;! i j k\&quot;, where $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ are the numbers you found. You should continue solving the next test cases or terminate the program after that.\n\nAfter printing a question or an answer do not forget to print the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get an \&quot;Idleness limit exceeded\&quot; verdict. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq n$$$, $$$j - i > 1$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;In each round your program must output a single line with an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and a binary string of length exactly $$$b$$$ denoting the binary representation of $$$y$$$ (most significant bit first).\n\nIf $$$i > 0$$$, this line encodes the question: Is $$$a_i$$$ bigger than $$$y$$$?. There should be at most $$$3 \\cdot (n+b)$$$ such lines; after each of them, the interactor will print yes or no in a single line.\n\nIf $$$i = 0$$$, this is the last round of interaction, after which your program should terminate, and $$$y$$$ should be the maximal value among the elements of Sphinx's array. Note that this round does not count to the query limit.\n\nNote that the interactor is adaptive.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nIf your solution does not correctly follow the interaction guideline above, it may receive an arbitrary verdict. Otherwise, your program will receive the Wrong Answer judgment if it reports the wrong maximum.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nTo make a query, output \&quot;? $$$i$$$ $$$j$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$) without quotes. Afterwards, you should read a single integer — the answer to your query $$$\\gcd(p_i,p_j)$$$. You can make at most $$$2n$$$ such queries in each test case.\n\nIf you want to print the answer, output \&quot;! $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$) without quotes. After doing that, read $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. If $$$p_x=0$$$ or $$$p_y=0$$$, you'll receive $$$1$$$, otherwise you'll receive $$$-1$$$. If you receive $$$-1$$$, your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nIf you receive the integer $$$-1$$$ instead of an answer or a valid value of $$$n$$$, it means your program has made an invalid query, has exceeded the limit of queries, or has given an incorrect answer on the previous test case. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$).\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$).\n\nThe second line of each test case should contain $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$. $$$p$$$ should be a permutation of $$$[0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1]$$$.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ should not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^4$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction with your program is organized via standard input and output streams.\n\nUpon startup, the program is provided with resource pool configuration and VM types as follows.\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers:\n\n- $$$N$$$: the number of network domains ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 8$$$),\n- $$$R$$$: the number of racks in each network domain ($$$1 \\leq R \\leq 32$$$),\n- $$$S$$$: the number of PMs in each rack ($$$1 \\leq S \\leq 16$$$),\n- $$$K$$$: the number of NUMA nodes per PM (2 or 4).\n\nEach of the next $$$K$$$ lines contains two integers:\n\n- $$$C_k$$$: CPU capacity of NUMA node $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq C_k \\leq 200$$$),\n- $$$M_k$$$: memory capacity of NUMA node $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq M_k \\leq 500$$$).\n\nThe next line contains one integer $$$F$$$ — the number of VM types ($$$1 \\leq F \\leq 20$$$).\n\nThe next $$$F$$$ lines describe the VM types. Each line contains three integers:\n\n- $$$n_f$$$: NUMA count of VM type $$$f$$$ (1 or 2),\n- $$$c_f$$$: CPU usage per NUMA node of VM type $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\leq c_f \\leq 100$$$),\n- $$$m_f$$$: memory usage per NUMA node of VM type $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m_f \\leq 100$$$).\n\nThen the program starts to receive and process a sequence of requests. The total number of requests $$$\\leq 13500$$$, the total number of created VMs $$$\\leq 235000$$$.\n\nIn each interaction round your program needs to read and process one request.\n\nThe first line of each request $$$i$$$ contains a single integer $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t_i \\leq 4$$$) which denotes the type of request:\n\n- 1: PG creation,\n- 2: VM creation,\n- 3: VM deletion,\n- 4: termination.\n\nThe following input and expected output depend on the request type.\n\nPG Creation\n\nThe next two lines describe the constraints for this placement group.\n\nThe first line contains three integers:\n\n- $$$j$$$: the index of new placement group (groups are indexed with consecutive integers starting from 1 in order of their appearance in the input),\n- $$$k_j$$$: the number of partitions for hard rack anti-affinity with partitions ($$$0 \\leq k_j \\leq 7$$$)   0 means there is no such constraint for this PG\n- $$$a_j$$$: the maximum number of VMs per PM for soft PM anti-affinity ($$$0 \\leq a_j \\leq 5$$$)   0 means there is no such constraint for this PG\n\nThe second line describes the affinity constraints. It contains two integers:\n\n- $$$n_j$$$: defines the network affinity requirement ($$$0 \\leq n_j \\leq 2$$$)   0 means there is no such constraint  1 means that the constraint is soft  2 means that the constraint is hard\n- $$$r_j$$$: defines the rack affinity requirement ($$$0 \\leq r_j \\leq 2$$$)   0 means there is no such constraint  1 means that the constraint is soft  2 means that the constraint is hard\n\nIt is guaranteed that $$$n_j \\geq r_j$$$. Also if $$$k_j \\neq 0$$$ then $$$r_j = 0$$$.\n\nAfter reading this request your program should create the new PG and read the next request without writing anything.\n\nVM Creation\n\nThe next line contains four integers:\n\n- $$$l_i$$$: the number of created VMs ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq 100$$$),\n- $$$f_i$$$: the type of created VMs ($$$1 \\leq f_i \\leq F$$$),\n- $$$j_i$$$: the index of (previously created) PG,\n- $$$p_i$$$: the index of partition in this PG ($$$-1 \\leq p_i \\leq k_j$$$)   0 means there is no such hard anti-affinity constraint in this PG  $$$p_i > 0$$$ means that all VMs must be placed in partition $$$p_i$$$  -1 means that each VM must be placed in a separate partition as follows: $$$i$$$-th VM must be placed in partition $$$i$$$ (in this case it is guaranteed that $$$l_i = k_j$$$)\n\nThe next line contains a sequence of $$$l_i$$$ integers — indexes of new VMs. The VMs are indexed with consecutive integers starting from 1 in order of their appearance in the input.\n\nAfter reading this request your program should try to place VMs from the request without violating the hard constraints of the corresponding PG.\n\nIf it succeeds to place all VMs from the request, it should write $$$l_i$$$ lines to the standard output. Each line must contain the placement decision for a single VM, and the output order should match the VM order in the request. The placement decision for VM $$$v$$$ should contain the following integers:\n\n- $$$n_v$$$: the index of network domain ($$$1 \\leq n_v \\leq N$$$),\n- $$$r_v$$$: the index of rack inside this network domain ($$$1 \\leq r_v \\leq R$$$),\n- $$$s_v$$$: the index of PM in this rack ($$$1 \\leq s_v \\leq S$$$),\n- 1 or 2 (depending on NUMA count of VM type) indexes of NUMA nodes in this PM, where the VM is placed (start indexes with 1 and separate them with space).\n\nIf your program can not place all VMs from the request so that all hard constraints are met and no NUMA node runs out of resources, it should write -1 to standard output and terminate.\n\nDo not output the partial placement if you cannot place all VMs from the request.\n\nNote that there can be multiple VM creation requests associated with the same PG. The only exception is PGs with rack affinity constraints ($$$r_j > 0$$$) — for such groups, only a single VM creation request is submitted.\n\nVM Deletion\n\nThe next line contains a positive integer $$$l_i$$$ and a sequence of $$$l_i$$$ unique integers — the number of deleted VMs followed by their indexes. It is guaranteed that all these VMs were created and were not deleted before this request. It is also guaranteed that all these VMs are from the same PG.\n\nAfter reading this request your program should delete VMs from this request, release the corresponding resources, and read the next request without writing anything.\n\nTermination\n\nAfter reading this request your program should terminate.\n\nLocal Test Kit\n\nThe local test kit is provided to facilitate the development of problem solutions. It includes the local interactor and the sample tests. Check out the zip archive in the contest materials (right menu).&quot;:1,&quot;This is an interactive problem. Initially you are given no information about the AIs's strategy, and you have to discover it yourself.\n\nFor each test, the AI selects one strategy from a pool of simple deterministic strategies and follows it throughout all rounds. There are 6 tests and 6 different strategies.\n\nOn each round you choose your move and output it to the standard output stream: 'R' for rock, 'P' for paper or 'S' for scissors. At the same time the AI will choose its move (not peeking at your choice). If your move beats AI's move, you win, otherwise AI wins. Note that a tie (both you and AI choosing the same move) counts as AI victory. You will get the outcome of the round via the standard input stream: \&quot;player\&quot; if you won, or \&quot;ai\&quot; if AI won (quotation marks for clarity only).\n\nYou are given 20 rounds of play: you can use the first 10 to learn the opponent's strategy, and you have to win the last 10. If you manage to win 10 rounds in row earlier than that, your solution is accepted on this test anyways.\n\nPlease make sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer.\n\nHere is an example of a strategy which always picks rock, implemented in C++.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with your program printing a query to the standard output and finishes when your program finds and prints the answer to the problem.\n\nEach query has a form of \&quot;? $$$x_q$$$ $$$y_q$$$\&quot;, where $$$x_q$$$ and $$$y_q$$$ are integers ($$$|x_q|, |y_q| \\le 10^6$$$; $$$x_q \\ne 0$$$ or $$$y_q \\ne 0$$$).\n\nThe interactor outputs a line with a single floating-point number — the distance between a query ray and a circle that is precise to $$$10^{-10}$$$ by an absolute value.\n\nYour program can make the next query, read the output, and so on. You are allowed to do at most $$$60$$$ queries. At the end of the interaction, print the answer line \&quot;! $$$x_c$$$ $$$y_c$$$ $$$r_c$$$\&quot;, flush the output and exit.\n\nNote, that the output of the interactor is actually rounded to the 10-th digit after a decimal point, so if you are stress-testing your solution locally, make sure that you also perform the corresponding rounding.&quot;:1,&quot;For each test case, the interaction begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nAfter reading $$$n$$$, print a single line containing either \&quot;first\&quot; or \&quot;second\&quot;, denoting what you want to play as (as first or second correspondingly).\n\nOn Alice's turn, you are required to print two positive integers, $$$p_{1}$$$ and $$$p_{2}$$$ such that $$$0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p$$$, $$$0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p$$$ and $$$p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p$$$. Here, $$$p$$$ equals one of the two integers printed by Bob in the previous turn. If no turn has occurred previously, $$$p$$$ is equal to $$$n$$$. If Alice cannot perform a break operation, print \&quot;0 0\&quot; to receive a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nOn Bob's turn, you should read two integers, $$$p_{1}$$$ and $$$p_{2}$$$ such that $$$0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p$$$, $$$0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p$$$ and $$$p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p$$$. Here, $$$p$$$ equals one of the two integers printed by Alice in the previous turn. If no turn has occurred previously, $$$p$$$ is equal to $$$n$$$. If Bob cannot perform a break operation $$$p_{1} = 0$$$ and $$$p_2 = 0$$$ in which case you should proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf any break operation performed by Alice is invalid, the interactor prints \&quot;-1 -1\&quot; and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nIf Alice performs $$$63$$$ turns and Bob can still execute a break operation on the current integers, the interactor prints \&quot;-1 -1\&quot;, and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nIn this problem, hacks are disabled.&quot;:1,&quot;Begin the interaction from reading a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nNext, read $$$n-1$$$ lines.\n\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$, $$$u_i\\neq v_i$$$), which means that there's an edge between nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.\n\nIt's guaranteed that weights of edges were $$$\\leq 10^9$$$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\nNow you may begin asking queries.

In order to apply the gadget you need to print two space-separated integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$). You will then receive either string \&quot;Yes\&quot;, if the train is between stations $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, inclusive, or string \&quot;No\&quot; otherwise. If $$$l = r$$$ and you received \&quot;Yes\&quot;, then you found the train successfully, and your program must halt immediately.\n\nAnswer \&quot;Bad\&quot; instead of \&quot;Yes\&quot; or \&quot;No\&quot; means that you made an invalid query or made too many queries. Exit immediately after receiving \&quot;Bad\&quot; and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

Two consecutive positions (including the initial one) should not differ by more than $$$k$$$.\n\nFor example, the following lines are the first lines of the sample test.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nTo make a query, output \&quot;? l r\&quot; ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$) without quotes. Afterwards, you should read one single integer — the answer for your query.\n\nIf you receive the integer $$$-1$$$ instead of an answer or a valid value of $$$n$$$, it means your program has made an invalid query, has exceed the limit of queries, or has given an incorrect answer on the previous test case. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you are ready to give the final answer, output \&quot;! i\&quot; ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) without quotes — the index of the maximum of the hidden permutation. After solving a test case, your program should move to the next one immediately. After solving all test cases, your program should be terminated immediately.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

To make a query, print on a separate line:\n\n- + c: this command will assign $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \\le c < n$$$) and then print $$$\\lfloor\\frac{x}{n}\\rfloor$$$ (divide $$$x$$$ by $$$n$$$ and round down) on a separate line.\n\nPrint the answer, like the queries, on a separate line. The answer doesn't count in number of queries. To output it, use the following format:\n\n- ! x: the current value of $$$x$$$.\n\nAfter that, your program should exit.\n\nYou have to use a flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout), in Java — System.out.flush(), in Pascal — flush(output) and in Python — sys.stdout.flush().\n\nNote that the interactor is not responsive.\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format: a single line must contain two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$n$$$, separated by a space.&quot;:1,&quot;Each test consists of several test cases.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nFor each testcase, your program should interact in the following format.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1\\,000$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nEach of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i, b_i\\leq n$$$) — the edges of the tree, indicating an edge between node $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ according to your labeling of the nodes.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $$$k_1$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k_1 \\leq n$$$) — the number of nodes in your subtree.\n\nThe next line contains $$$k_1$$$ distinct integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{k_1}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$$$) — the indices of the nodes in your subtree, according to your labeling.

It is guaranteed that these vertices form a subtree according to Li Chen's labelling of the tree's nodes.\n\nTest cases will be provided one by one, so you must complete interacting with the previous test (i.e. by printing out a common node or $$$-1$$$ if there is not such node) to start receiving the next one.\n\nYou can ask the Andrew two different types of questions.\n\n- You can print \&quot;A x\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$). Andrew will look at vertex $$$x$$$ in your labeling and respond to you with the number of this vertex in Li Chen's labeling.\n- You can print \&quot;B y\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq y \\leq n$$$). Andrew will look at vertex $$$y$$$ in Li Chen's labeling and respond to you with the number of this vertex in your labeling.\n\nYou may only ask at most $$$5$$$ questions per tree.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print \&quot;C s\&quot;, where $$$s$$$ is your label of a vertex that is common to both subtrees, or $$$-1$$$, if no such vertex exists. Printing the answer does not count as a question. Remember to flush your answer to start receiving the next test case.\n\nAfter printing a question do not forget to print end of line and flush the output.

Your program should immediately terminate (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive Wrong Answer; it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t=1$$$).\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1\\,000$$$).\n\nThe third line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq p_i\\leq n$$$) — a permutation of $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. This encodes the labels that Li Chen chose for his tree. In particular, Li Chen chose label $$$p_i$$$ for the node you labeled $$$i$$$.\n\nEach of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i, b_i\\leq n$$$). These edges should form a tree.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer $$$k_1$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k_1 \\leq n$$$).\n\nThe next line should contain $$$k_1$$$ distinct integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{k_1}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$$$). These vertices should form a subtree.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer $$$k_2$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k_2 \\leq n$$$).\n\nThe next line should contain $$$k_2$$$ distinct integers $$$y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{k_2}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq y_i \\leq n$$$). These vertices should form a subtree in Li Chen's tree according to the permutation above.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with reading $$$n$$$.\n\nThen you are allowed to make at most $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ queries in the following way:\n\n- \&quot;? x y\&quot; ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\ne y$$$).\n\nAfter each one, you should read an integer $$$k$$$, that equals $$$p_x \\bmod p_y$$$.\n\nWhen you have guessed the permutation, print a single line \&quot;! \&quot; (without quotes), followed by array $$$p$$$ and quit.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nExit immediately after receiving \&quot;-1\&quot; and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHack format\n\nIn the first line output $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$). In the second line print the permutation of $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;In each round, your program needs to print a line containing one uppercase letter A, B or C and an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1\\le a\\le n$$$ for operations A and C, $$$2\\le a\\le n$$$ for operation B). This line desribes operation you make.\n\nIf your operation has type C your program should terminate immediately.\n\nElse your program should read one line containing a single integer, which is the answer to your operation.\n\nAfter outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. To do it use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C/C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the number $$$x$$$ is fixed and won't change during the interaction process.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo make a hack, use such input format:\n\nThe only line should contain two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;This is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 30$$$), the number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print $$$n$$$ magic words it has created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must have at least 1 and at most $$$30\\cdot n$$$ characters, and each character must be either X or O. We will denote the $$$i$$$-th magic word you printed as $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 1000$$$), the number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process $$$q$$$ times, one per student.\n\nFor the $$$j$$$-th student, it should first read a single integer $$$p_j$$$, the power of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two indices $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ independently and uniformly at random between 1 and $$$n$$$ inclusive, concatenating $$$w_{u_j}$$$ and $$$w_{v_j}$$$, and finding the number of different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program must print the numbers $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$, in this order ($$$1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n$$$).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student in the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after printing $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ for each student.&quot;:1,&quot;You can ask queries by printing \&quot;? $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$\&quot; $$$(1 \\leq l < r \\leq n)$$$. The answer is the index of the second maximum of all elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r$$$. Array $$$a$$$ is fixed beforehand and can't be changed in time of interaction.\n\nYou can output the answer by printing \&quot;! $$$p$$$\&quot;, where $$$p$$$ is the index of the maximum element in the array.\n\nYou can ask no more than 20 queries. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

In the second line output a permutation of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The position of $$$n$$$ in the permutation is the position of the maximum&quot;:1,&quot;Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nThen you can make no more than $$$n$$$ queries.\n\nTo make a query, output a line in the format \&quot;? $$$d$$$\&quot; (without quotes) ($$$0 \\le d \\le n - 1$$$). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.\n\nWhen you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format \&quot;! $$$v_1\\ v_2 \\ldots v_n$$$\&quot; (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as one of the $$$n$$$ queries. After solving one test case, the program should immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program should be terminated immediately.\n\nIf your program makes more than $$$n$$$ queries for one test case or makes an incorrect query, then the response to the query will be $$$-1$$$, and after receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nThe interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the interaction.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nEach of the following $$$(n - 2)$$$ lines should contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph. Each edge must not occur more than once.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$10^5$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;First, read an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 600$$$) — the number of vertices in Bob's graph.\n\nTo make a query, print two lines. First of which should be in the format \&quot;? k\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$), where $$$k$$$ is the size of the set to be queried. The second line should contain $$$k$$$ space separated distinct integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq n$$$) — the vertices of the queried set.\n\nAfter each query read a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$) — the number of edges between the vertices of the set $$$\\{s_i\\}$$$.\n\nYou are not allowed to ask more than $$$20000$$$ queries.\n\nIf $$$m = -1$$$, it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. Your program should immediately terminate (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive Wrong Answer; it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to print end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nWhen you know the answer, you need to print it.\n\nThe format of the answer depends on whether the graph is bipartite or not.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, print two lines. The first should contain the letter \&quot;Y\&quot; (short for \&quot;YES\&quot;) followed by a space, and then a single integer $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\leq s \\leq n$$$) — the number of vertices in one of the partitions. Second line should contain $$$s$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_s$$$ — vertices belonging to the first partition. All $$$a_i$$$ must be distinct, and all edges in the main graph must have exactly one endpoint in the set $$$\\{a_i\\}$$$.\n\nIf the graph is not bipartite, print two lines. The first should contain the letter \&quot;N\&quot; (short for \&quot;NO\&quot;) followed by a space, and then a single integer $$$l$$$ ($$$3 \\leq l \\leq n$$$) — the length of one simple cycle of odd length. Second line should contain $$$l$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_l$$$ — the vertices along the cycle. It must hold that for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq l$$$, there is an edge $$$\\{c_i, c_{(i \\mod l)+1}\\}$$$ in the main graph, and all $$$c_i$$$ are distinct.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nHacks format For hacks, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m~(1 \\leq n \\leq 600, 0 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$ — the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i~(1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n)$$$ mean that there is an edge between $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. There must not be any multiple edges, no loops, and the graph must be connected.\n\nFor example, you need to use this test to get the first sample:&quot;:1,&quot;Once you have read the description of the test case, you can make queries. Queries can be of three types:\n\n1. \&quot;- $$$x$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\le x \\le m$$$). In this case the road with the number $$$x$$$ is blocked if it has not already been blocked.\n2. \&quot;+ $$$x$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\le x \\le m$$$). In this case the road with the number $$$x$$$ is unblocked. Note that road $$$x$$$ must be blocked beforehand. All roads are initially unblocked.\n3. \&quot;? $$$y$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\le y \\le n$$$). In this case the jury program chooses some city $$$s$$$. If you can get from town $$$s$$$ to town $$$y$$$ by unblocked repaired roads, the jury program will output $$$1$$$, otherwise the jury program will output $$$0$$$. Note that city $$$s$$$ will be selected before getting information about city $$$y$$$, but your previous requests may be taken into account when selecting city $$$s$$$.\n\nIn total, you can make no more than $$$100 \\cdot m$$$ queries for each set of input data.\n\nAfter you have found all repaired roads, output \&quot;! $$$c_1,\\ c_2,\\ c_3,\\ \\ldots,\\ c_m$$$\&quot;, where $$$c_i$$$ is $$$1$$$ if road $$$i$$$ is repaired, and $$$0$$$ if road is not repaired. This output will not count in the total number of queries. The jury program will output $$$1$$$ if your answer is correct, and $$$0$$$ if the answer is not correct. If you received $$$0$$$, your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise you can get any verdict, because the program will continue reading from the closed stream. If you read $$$1$$$, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there is none.\n\nNote that you do not have to unblock all roads before outputting the answer. It is guaranteed that all repaired roads are fixed initially and will not be changed by the jury program depending on queries.\n\nAfter outputting a query or the answer do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nYou can't do hacks on this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;For each test case, begin the interaction by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nTo make a query, output \&quot;$$$\\texttt{?}\\;l\\;r$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) without quotes. Afterwards, you should read in $$$r-l+1$$$ integers — the integers $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r$$$, in increasing order. You can make at most $$$15$$$ such queries in a single test case.\n\nIf you receive the integer $$$-1$$$ instead of an answer or the integer $$$n$$$, it means your program has made an invalid query, has exceed the limit of queries, or has given incorrect answer on the previous test case. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you are ready to give the final answer, output \&quot;$$$\\texttt{!}\\;x$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$) without quotes — the element that did not change position. Giving this answer does not count towards the limit of $$$15$$$ queries. Afterwards, your program must continue to solve the remaining test cases, or exit if all test cases have been solved.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format. The first line must contain an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case must contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n < 10^4$$$; $$$n$$$ is odd) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\n\nThe second line of each test case must contain $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$. The array $$$a$$$ should be the result of $$$\\frac{n-1}{2}$$$ disjoint swaps on the array $$$[1,2,\\dots,n]$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question, print it in one of the formats above:\n\n- d $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\le u \\le n$$$), or\n- s $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\le u \\le n$$$).\n\nAfter each question, you should read the answer: either the distance or the second vertex on the path, as mentioned in the legend.\n\nIf we answer with $$$-1$$$ instead of a valid answer, that means you exceeded the number of queries, made an invalid query, or violated the condition in the second type of queries. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks:\n\nThe first line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$).\n\nEach of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u,v \\le n$$$) that mean there is an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. The edges must form a tree.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with reading $$$n$$$.\n\nThen you can make one type of query:\n\n- \&quot;$$$? \\enspace l \\enspace r$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) where $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are the bounds of the subarray that you wish to query.\n\nThe answer to each query will be in the form \&quot;$$$x \\enspace f$$$\&quot; where $$$x$$$ is the mode of the subarray and $$$f$$$ is the number of times $$$x$$$ appears in the subarray.\n\n- $$$x$$$ satisfies ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$).\n- $$$f$$$ satisfies ($$$1 \\leq f \\leq r-l+1$$$).\n- If you make more than $$$4k$$$ queries or violate the number range in the query, you will get an output \&quot;-1.\&quot;\n- If you terminate after receiving the response \&quot;$$$-1$$$\&quot;, you will get the \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nTo output your answer, print:\n\n- \&quot;$$$! \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \\ldots \\enspace a_{n-1} \\enspace a_n$$$\&quot; which is an exclamation point followed by the array with a space between every element.\n\nAnd quit after that. This query is not counted towards the $$$4k$$$ queries limit.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, output $$$1$$$ integer on the first line, $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). On the second line output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, a_n$$$ separated by a space such that there are at most $$$25000$$$ distinct numbers and $$$a_j \\le a_{j+1}$$$ for all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;Firstly, the jury sends one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 250$$$) which should be read — the number of players. After that, your program may ask queries or report an answer.\n\nTo ask a query, print \&quot;? $$$i \\; s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_n$$$\&quot; (without quotes), where $$$i$$$ is the index of the player who will play against some of the other players in the simul. $$$s$$$ is a binary string that denotes the players they play against. $$$i$$$ plays against every player $$$j$$$ for which $$$s_j = 1$$$ holds (and $$$s_j = 1$$$ should hold for at least one $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$). Please note that $$$s_i = 0$$$ must hold since a player cannot play against themselves, otherwise, the query is considered to be incorrect.\n\nAfter this, you should read an integer — the number of games player $$$i$$$ has won.\n\nWhen you have identified the answer, you must print \&quot;! $$$c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_n$$$\&quot; (without quotes) and terminate your program. $$$c$$$ is a binary string which represents the candidate masters. Player $$$i$$$ is a candidate master if $$$c_i=1$$$ holds, otherwise, they are not.\n\nIf you ask more than $$$2n$$$ queries or if one of the queries is malformed, the interaction terminates immediately and your program receives verdict Wrong Answer.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks are disabled in this problem.&quot;:1,&quot;In this task, interaction consists of several phases.\n\nIn the first phase, the interactor gives as an input to your program three integers $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\le N \\le 1000$$$), $$$M$$$ ($$$0 \\le M \\le 100\\,000$$$), $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 2000$$$): the number of vertices and edges in the initial graph, and the number of times Ginny has to guess the chosen vertex. The next $$$M$$$ lines contain pairs of vertices $$$a_i$$$ $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le N$$$): beginning and end of corresponding graph edges. The graph is guaranteed to be acyclic and all of its edges to be distinct.\n\nThe solution should print an integer $$$K$$$ ($$$0 \\le K \\le 4242$$$): the number of edges to change in the graph. The next $$$K$$$ lines should contain either \&quot;+ $$$a_i$$$ $$$b_i$$$\&quot; or \&quot;- $$$a_i$$$ $$$b_i$$$\&quot;: the beginning and the end of an edge that Ginny has to add or remove accordingly. You are allowed to add preexisting edges to the graph. Operations are performed in the order of appearance, so Ginny is allowed to remove an edge added by the solution. You can only remove an existing edge. The operations can create cycles in the graph.\n\nThe next $$$T$$$ phases are dedicated to guessing the chosen vertices. In each phase, the solution can make at most 20 queries and then print the answer. To query a multiset $$$S$$$, the solution should print \&quot;? $$$|S|~S_1~S_2~\\dots~S_{|S|}$$$\&quot;. The total size of all multisets in a single phase should not exceed 20. The interactor will reply with one of the following words:\n\n- \&quot;Win\&quot;, if the winner of a combinatorial game with tokens in multiset $$$S$$$ and the selected vertex is the first player.\n- \&quot;Lose\&quot;, if the winner of a combinatorial game with tokens in multiset $$$S$$$ and the selected vertex is the second player.\n- \&quot;Draw\&quot;, if a combinatorial game with tokens in multiset $$$S$$$ and selected vertex ends in a draw.\n- \&quot;Slow\&quot;, if the solution made a 21-st request, or the total size of all multisets in a single phase exceeded 20. In this case, the solution should terminate and receive Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAs soon as the selected vertex is guessed, that solution should print \&quot;! v\&quot;. If the chosen vertex is guessed correctly, the interactor will print Correct and the solution should either move on to the next phase of guessing or finish its execution if it's the last phase. Otherwise, the interactor will print Wrong, which means that the solution should terminate and will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nThe interactor can change the chosen vertex based on graph changes and solution actions, but at every given moment of time, at least one vertex that corresponds to all given interactor answers will exist.\n\nHack format\n\nHacks have the following extra limitations:\n\n- $$$T = 1$$$\n- you need to specify a single vertex, chosen by the interactor.\n\nHack test format. The first line of input contains three integers $$$N~M~1$$$. The next $$$M$$$ lines on input contain edge description in the same format as in the input. The next line contains a single integer $$$v$$$: the number of the chosen vertex. The hack will be successful even if the solution guesses the vertex right, but the vertex will not be the single one to match all performed queries.&quot;:1,&quot;You begin the interaction by reading $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.\n\nTo ask a question about elements on positions $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k$$$, in a separate line output\n\n$$$?$$$ $$$x_1$$$ $$$x_2$$$ $$$x_3$$$ ... $$$x_k$$$\n\nNumbers in the query have to satisfy $$$1 \\le x_i \\le n$$$, and all $$$x_i$$$ have to be different. Don't forget to 'flush', to get the answer.\n\nIn response, you will receive two integers $$$pos$$$ and $$$a_{pos}$$$ — the position in the array $$$a$$$ of the $$$m$$$-th in ascending order element among $$$a_{x_1}, a_{x_2}, \\dots, a_{x_k}$$$, and the element on this position.\n\nIn case your query is invalid or you asked more than $$$n$$$ queries, the program will print $$$-1$$$ and will finish interaction. You will receive a Wrong answer verdict. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nWhen you determine $$$m$$$, output\n\n$$$!$$$ $$$m$$$\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack format\n\nFor the hacks use the following format:\n\nThe first line has to contain three integers $$$n, k, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le k < n \\le 500$$$) — the length of the array, number of elements in the query, and which in the ascending order number the device returns.\n\nIn the next line output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. They have to be pairwise different.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$6 \\le n,m \\le 40$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are even) — the dimensions of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line contains four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1, x_2 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_1, y_2 \\le m$$$) — the positions of the white and the black knight. It is guaranteed that the two knights have different starting positions. It is also guaranteed that none of the knights are in their own target square in the beginning of the game (however, they can be on the opponent's target position).\n\nYour program should reply with either \&quot;WHITE\&quot; or \&quot;BLACK\&quot;, depending on the knight you want to play with. In case you select the white knight, you start the game.\n\nDuring every your turn, you need to print two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, the position to move the knight. If you won the game by this turn, you must terminate your program immediately.\n\nAfter every turn of the opponent, you will receive two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, the position where Bob moved his knight.\n\nIf your last move was illegal or you lost the game after jury's turn, or you made $$$350$$$ moves, and haven't won, you will receive \&quot;-1 -1\&quot;. In such cases, you should terminate your program and then you will get a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing anything, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you might get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks are disabled for this problem.\n\nJury's program is adaptive: the moves of jury may depend on the moves made by your program.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\nAfter reading, print a single line containing either First or Second, denoting who you want to play as. The interaction then varies depending on who you chose to play as.\n\nIf you chose to play as First, print a single line containing $$$2n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{2n}$$$, denoting that the number $$$i$$$ belongs to the $$$p_i$$$-th pair for $$$1\\le i \\le 2n$$$. Thus, $$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, and every number between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive should appear exactly twice.\n\nIf you chose to play as Second, the interactor will print $$$2n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{2n}$$$, denoting that the number $$$i$$$ belongs to the $$$p_i$$$-th pair. As a response, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ in a single line. These should contain exactly one number from each pair.\n\nRegardless of who you chose to play as the interactor will finish by printing a single integer: $$$0$$$ if your answer for the test case is correct (that is, you are playing as First and it cannot choose adequate numbers from your pairs, or you are playing as Second and your chosen numbers add up to a multiple of $$$2n$$$), or $$$-1$$$ if it is incorrect. In particular, the interactor will not print the chosen numbers if you choose to play First and lose. In either case, your program should terminate immediately after reading this number.\n\nIf at any point you make an invalid interaction, the interactor will print $$$-1$$$ and finish the interaction. You will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Make sure to terminate immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nAfter printing something do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\nThe second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{2n}$$$, denoting that the number $$$i$$$ belongs to the $$$p_i$$$-th pair if the solution being hacked chooses to play as Second. If the solution being hacked chooses to play as First, those pairs don't matter but the $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{2n}$$$ must still form a valid partition of $$$1, 2, \\dots, 2n$$$ into $$$n$$$ disjoint pairs.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question, print \&quot;? $$$x_q$$$\&quot; $$$(0 \\le x_q < 10^6 + 3)$$$. The judge will respond with a single integer $$$f(x_q) \\mod (10^6 + 3)$$$. If you ever get a result of $$$−1$$$ (because you printed an invalid query), exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print \&quot;! $$$x_0$$$\&quot; where $$$x_0$$$ is the answer or $$$-1$$$ if there is no such $$$x_0$$$.\n\nYou can ask at most $$$50$$$ questions per test case.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format.\n\nThe only line should contain $$$11$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{10}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 10^6 + 3$$$, $$$\\max\\limits_{0 \\le i \\le 10}{a_i} > 0$$$) — corresponding coefficients of the polynomial.&quot;:1,&quot;The first line of the standard input stream contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) — the number of points your program should name.\n\nThen n times your program must print two integer coordinates x and y (0 ≤ x ≤ 109, 0 ≤ y ≤ 109). All points you print must be distinct.\n\nIn response to each coordinate pair your program will receive the string \&quot;black\&quot;, if the point is black, or \&quot;white\&quot;, if the point is white.\n\nWhen all n points are processed, you need to print four integers x1, y1, x2 and y2 (0 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 109, 0 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 109) — coordinates of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), which form a line, which separates n points into black and white. Points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) should not coincide.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack solution use the following format. The first line must contain word \&quot;hack\&quot;, the second line should contain the number n and the last line should contain the sequence of 0 and 1 — colors of points, which will be reported to the solution. Unlike the jury tests, colors of points in hacks are always fixed in advance. Of course, the hacked solution wouldn't be able to get the information about the colors in advance.\n\nFor example, the hack corresponding to sample test will look like this:&quot;:1,&quot;The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the chessboard, and then the interaction begins.\n\nTo ask a question, print \&quot;? $$$r$$$ $$$c$$$\&quot; (without quotes, $$$1 \\leq r \\leq n, 1 \\leq c \\leq m$$$). Then you should input the response from standard input — the minimum steps the king needs to move to the chosen cell.\n\nIf your program has asked an invalid question or has run out of questions, the interactor will terminate immediately and your program will get a verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo give the final answer, print \&quot;! $$$r$$$ $$$c$$$\&quot; (without the quotes, $$$(r,c)$$$ is the king's initial coordinate). Note that giving this answer is not counted towards the limit of $$$3$$$ questions.\n\nAfter asking a question do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$).\n\nThe first and only line of each test case should contain four integers $$$n,m,r,c$$$ ($$$1\\le r\\le n\\le 10^9,1\\le c\\le m\\le 10^9$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query, print \&quot;? A B\&quot; $$$(1 \\leq A,B \\leq N, A\\neq B)$$$. The judge will respond \&quot;Yes\&quot; if house B is reachable from house A, or \&quot;No\&quot; otherwise.\n\nTo output the final answer, print \&quot;! A B\&quot;, where A and B are bi-reachable with the maximum possible value of $$$|k_A - k_B|$$$. If there does not exist such pair of houses A and B, output \&quot;! 0 0\&quot;.\n\nAfter outputting the final answer, your program must terminate immediately, otherwise you will receive Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nYou cannot ask the same query twice. There is no upper limit to the number of queries you ask, but, you cannot ask more queries after the judge answers \&quot;Yes\&quot; to any of your queries. Your program must now output the final answer (\&quot;! A B\&quot; or \&quot;! 0 0\&quot;) and terminate.\n\nIf you ask a query in incorrect format or repeat a previous query, you will get Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the Idleness limit exceeded error. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a query print a single line:\n\n- In the beginning print \&quot;? c \&quot; (without quotes) where $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\leq c \\leq n)$$$ denotes the number of nodes being queried, followed by $$$c$$$ distinct integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the indices of nodes from the list.\n\nFor each query, you will receive two integers $$$x$$$, $$$d$$$ — the node (among the queried nodes) with the minimum sum of distances to the hidden nodes and the sum of distances from that node to the hidden nodes. If the subset of nodes queried is invalid or you exceeded the number of queries then you will get $$$x = d = -1$$$. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nWhen you have guessed the hidden nodes, print a single line \&quot;! \&quot; (without quotes), followed by two integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the hidden nodes. You can output the hidden nodes in any order.\n\nAfter this, you should read a string. If you guess the nodes correctly, you will receive the string \&quot;Correct\&quot;. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases or terminate the program, if all test cases were solved. Otherwise, you will receive the string \&quot;Incorrect\&quot;. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.\n\nGuessing the hidden nodes does not count towards the number of queries asked.\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive. The hidden nodes do not change with queries.\n\nDo not forget to read the string \&quot;Correct\&quot; / \&quot;Incorrect\&quot; after guessing the hidden nodes.\n\nYou need to solve each test case before receiving the input for the next test case.\n\nThe limit of $$$14$$$ queries applies to each test case and not to the entire input.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack the solution, use the following test format:\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 1000)$$$ — the number of nodes in the tree. The second line should contain two distinct integers in the range $$$[1, n]$$$  — the hidden nodes. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\le u, v \\le n, u \\ne v)$$$  — the edges of the tree.&quot;:1,&quot;For each test case, you need to output a single line containing either \&quot;Alice\&quot; or \&quot;Bob\&quot;, representing the player you choose.\n\nThen for each of the following $$$n$$$ rounds, the following two-step process happens:\n\n1. Alice (either you or the interactor) will output two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 3$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$) — the colors chosen by Alice.\n2. Bob (either you or the interactor) will output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$c = a$$$ or $$$c = b$$$) — the vertex and the color chosen by Bob. Vertex $$$i$$$ must be a previously uncolored vertex.\n\nIf any of your outputs are invalid, the jury will output \&quot;-1\&quot; and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nAt the end of all $$$n$$$ turns, if you have lost the game, the jury will output \&quot;-1\&quot; and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nIf your program has received a $$$-1$$$ instead of a valid value, it must terminate immediately. Otherwise, you may receive an arbitrary verdict because your solution might be reading from a closed stream.\n\nNote that if you are playing as Alice, and there already exists an edge connected two vertices of the same color, the interactor will not terminate early and you will keep playing all $$$n$$$ rounds.\n\nAfter outputting, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

Fields Referee and Time may be absent, then $$$-1$$$ will be passed instead.\n- In response to this, your program must print one of four lines: \&quot;HOME\&quot;, \&quot;DRAW\&quot;, \&quot;AWAY\&quot; or \&quot;SKIP\&quot;. \&quot;HOME\&quot; — home team bet, \&quot;DRAW\&quot; — draw bet, \&quot;AWAY\&quot; — away team bet, \&quot;SKIP\&quot; — don't make a bet. After that, your program should print the line feed and flush the output buffer.\n- After that, post-match characteristics will be given to your program.

It is guaranteed that the graph is connected, does not contain multiple edges and the degrees of all vertices do not exceed 50.\n\nYou can find map descriptions for all tests in the archive 'map_descriptions.zip' which you can find in any of the archives 'problem-X-materials.zip' in the section \&quot;Contest materials\&quot; — they are all the same.\n\nAfter that the interaction begins. The interactor prints vertex descriptions in the following format: $$$$$$R~d~deg_1~flag_1~deg_2~flag_2 \\ldots deg_d~flag_d,$$$$$$ where $$$d$$$ is the degree of the current vertex, $$$deg_i$$$ is the degree of the $$$i$$$-th vertex adjacent to the current one, and $$$flag_i$$$ (0 or 1) is an indicator if the $$$i$$$-th adjacent vertex contains a flag. The order of neighbors in the vertex description is chosen by the interactor uniformly at random independently each time. Please keep in mind that you are not given the actual labels of adajacent vertices.\n\nIn response to the description of the vertex you should print a single integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq d$$$), which means that you have chosen the vertex with description $$$deg_i~flag_i$$$. Remember to use the flush operation after each output. If your output is invalid, you will get a \&quot;Wrong Answer\&quot; verdict.\n\nWhen you have visited all the vertices of the graph at least once, the interactor prints the string \&quot;AC\&quot; instead of the vertex description. If you use more than $$$2 \\cdot base\\_move\\_count$$$ moves, the interactor prints the string \&quot;F\&quot;. In both cases, you have to either start reading the description of the next map, or terminate the program, if it has been the last map in the test.\n\nBelow the example of interaction is presented. Note that the test from the example is not the same that your solution will be tested on.&quot;:1,&quot;To flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 200 queries, or if you print an incorrect coordinates.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\n\nHacking.\n\nThe first line should contain an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 216).\n\nThe second line should contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (1 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ n) — the description of the first rectangle.\n\nThe third line contains the description of the second rectangle in the similar way.&quot;:1,&quot;Begin the interaction by reading $$$n,m$$$.\n\nTo make a query, print \&quot;? $$$s$$$\&quot; (without quotes, $$$s$$$ is a string of length $$$m$$$, consisting of characters 0 and/or 1). Then you should read our response from standard input — the maximum capacity of the system in the simulated state.\n\nIf your program has made an invalid query or has run out of tries, the interactor will terminate immediately and your program will get a verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo give the final answer, print \&quot;! $$$L$$$\&quot; (without the quotes, $$$L$$$ is the minimum capacity of the system with all tracks functional). Note that giving this answer is not counted towards the limit of $$$2m$$$ queries.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nThe first line of input must contain two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$, $$$1\\le m \\le 500$$$) — the number of stations and tracks.\n\nThe next $$$m$$$ lines of input must contain exactly $$$3$$$ space-separated integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i\\ne v_i$$$, $$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq 10^6$$$) — the endpoints and the length of the $$$i$$$-th track.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question print character \&quot;?\&quot; (without quotes), an integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ n), and c distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pc (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the indexes of icicles that you want to know about. Note that \&quot;?\&quot; and c should be separated by a space; the indexes should be separated by a space too.\n\nAfter you asked the question, read a single integer — the answer.\n\nNote that you can't ask more than 19 questions. If you ask more than 19 questions or at least one incorrect question, your solution will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.\n\nIf at some moment your program reads  - 1 as an answer, it should immediately exit (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot; in this case, it means that you asked more than 19 questions, or asked an invalid question. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution will get \&quot;Idleness Limit Exceeded\&quot;, if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output, including for the final answer .\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- For other languages see the documentation.\n\nHacking\n\nFor hacking use the following format:\n\nn x y p1 p2\n\nHere 1 ≤ p1 < p2 ≤ n are the indexes of the special icicles.\n\nContestant programs will not be able to see this input.&quot;:1,&quot;In the beginning, your program should read one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of vertices of the tree which encrypts the device ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$).\n\nAfter that, you can make several operations in the following format. To do operation print a symbol\&quot;?\&quot; (without quotes) and $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$$$, separated by spaces after it. Please note, that for all $$$i$$$ you can only use the numbers, satisfying the inequality $$$0 \\leq d_i < n$$$. After that, you should read a string $$$s$$$ with length $$$n$$$, consisting of symbols \&quot;0\&quot; and \&quot;1\&quot; (without quotes). For all $$$i$$$ the symbol $$$s_i$$$ is equal to \&quot;0\&quot;, if the lamp on the device, connected with $$$i$$$-th vertex of the tree is switched off and \&quot;1\&quot; otherwise.\n\nAfter several operations, you should print guessed tree. To do it print the only symbol \&quot;!\&quot; (without quotes). In the next $$$n-1$$$ lines print $$$2$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ — indexes of the vertices connected by $$$i$$$-th edge of the tree. This numbers should satisfy the conditions $$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$$$ and $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$. This edges should form a tree, which is equal to the hidden tree. After that, your program should terminate.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that in each test the tree is fixed before and won't change depending on your program's operations.\n\nYour program can make from $$$0$$$ to $$$80$$$ operations with the device and after that guess the tree equal with the hidden.\n\nIf your program will make more than $$$80$$$ operations it can get any verdict, because it will continue reading from closed input. If your program will make operation or print the answer in the incorrect format, it can get any verdict too. Be careful.\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing questions and answers.\n\nTo flush the output, you can use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++.\n- System.out.flush() in Java.\n- stdout.flush() in Python.\n- flush(output) in Pascal.\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks:\n\nThe first line should contain one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of vertices in the tree ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$). Next $$$n-1$$$ lines should contain $$$2$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ — indexes of the vertices connected by $$$i$$$-th edge of the tree ($$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$). All edges should form a tree. Be careful, extra spaces or line breaks are not allowed.&quot;:1,&quot;Print each query in three lines. In the first line print the sizes of subset in the following format: \&quot;? $$$k_a$$$ $$$k_b$$$\&quot; where $$$k_a$$$ and $$$k_b$$$ ($$$1 \\le k_a, k_b \\le n$$$; $$$k_a + k_b \\le n$$$) — the corresponding sizes.\n\nIn the second line print $$$k_a$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{k_a}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$; $$$a_i \\neq a_j$$$ if $$$i \\neq j$$$) — indexes of boxes in the first subset.\n\nIn the third line print $$$k_b$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_{k_b}$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$; $$$b_i \\neq b_j$$$ if $$$i \\neq j$$$) — indexes of boxes in the second subset.\n\nThe subsets shouldn't intersect, i. e. $$$a_i \\neq b_j$$$ for all $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.\n\nYou'll receive one of four responses described above. In the case of WASTED stop your program to avoid getting random verdict instead of Wrong Answer.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction starts with a line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 300$$$, $$$0 \\leq t \\leq n$$$) — the length of the sequence and the number of $$$1$$$s in it.\n\nAfter that, you can make queries.\n\nTo make a query, print a line \&quot;? l r\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$), then flush the output.\n\nAfter each query, read a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$-1 \\leq t \\leq n$$$).\n\n- If $$$t=-1$$$, it means that you're out of queries, you should terminate your program immediately, then you will get Wrong Answer, otherwise the judging result would be undefined because you will interact with a closed stream.\n- If $$$t \\geq 0$$$, it represents the current number of $$$1$$$s in the sequence.\n\nWhen you found the original sequence, print a line \&quot;! s\&quot;, flush the output and terminate. Print $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ as a binary string and do not print spaces in between.\n\nYour solution will get Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output.\n\nTo flush you need to do the following right after printing a query and a line end:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nFor hacks, use the following format:\n\nIn the first and only line, print a non-empty binary string. Its length will be $$$n$$$ and it will be treated as $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$.\n\nFor example, the the test corresponding to the example contains a line \&quot;0011\&quot;.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction between your program and the jury's program begins with reading a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$) — the length of the hidden permutation.\n\nTo make a query, output a line in the format \&quot;? i\&quot;, where $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$.\n\nAs an answer, you will receive:\n\n- \&quot;>\&quot;, if $$$a_i$$$ > $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will increase by $$$1$$$.\n- \&quot;<\&quot;, if $$$a_i$$$ < $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$.\n- \&quot;=\&quot;, if $$$a_i$$$ = $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will remain unchanged.\n\nYou can make no more than $$$40n$$$ queries. To output the answer, you need to print \&quot;! a_1 a_2 ... a_n\&quot;, where $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$, and all of them are distinct. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nIf your program makes more than $$$40n$$$ queries for one test case, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be -1. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to print a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Presentation Error. To flush the buffer, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.\n\nThe interactor in this problem is not adaptive.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of each test case should consist of two lines. The first line contains the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$) — the length of the hidden permutation and the initial value of the number $$$x$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the permutation that the jury should choose in this test case.\n\nSum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$2000$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;In each test your program should guess a single array.\n\nThe input starts with a line containing integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the length of the array. Your program should read it at first.\n\nAfter that your program should print to the standard output the requests about the sum of two elements or inform that the array is guessed.\n\n- In case your program is making a request to ask the sum of two elements, it should print line in the format \&quot;? i j\&quot; (i and j are distinct integers between 1 and n), where i and j are indices in the array a.\n- In case your program informs that the array is guessed, it should print line in the format \&quot;! a1 a2 ... an\&quot; (it is guaranteed that all ai are positive integers not exceeding 105), where ai is the i-th element of the array a.\n\nThe response on a request is a single integer equal to ai + aj, printed on a separate line.\n\nYour program can do at most n requests. Note that the final line «! a1 a2 ... an» is not counted as a request.\n\nDo not forget about flush operation after each printed line.\n\nAfter you program prints the guessed array, it should terminate normally.&quot;:1,&quot;Initially, the jury program sends one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nAt the start of each test case, the jury program sends one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the length of the string.\n\nAfter that, your program can submit queries to the jury program by printing one of the following lines (do not forget to flush the output after printing a line!):\n\n- $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ — the query \&quot;what is the value of $$$p_i$$$?\&quot;;\n- $$$2$$$ $$$i$$$ — the query \&quot;what is the value of $$$q_i$$$?\&quot;.\n\nFor every query, the jury prints one integer on a separate line. It is either:\n\n- the answer for your query, if the query is correct and you haven't exceeded the query limit;\n- or the integer $$$-1$$$, if your query is incorrect (for example, the constraint $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ is not met) or if you have asked too many queries while processing the current test case.\n\nTo submit the answer, your program should send a line in the following format (do not forget to flush the output after printing a line!):\n\n- $$$0$$$ $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1.\n\nIf your guess is correct, the jury program will print one integer $$$1$$$ on a separate line, indicating that you may proceed to the next test case (or terminate the program, if it was the last test case) and that the number of queries you have asked is reset. If it is not correct, the jury program will print one integer $$$-1$$$ on a separate line.\n\nAfter your program receives $$$-1$$$ as the answer, it should immediately terminate. This will lead to your submission receiving the verdict \&quot;Wrong Answer\&quot;. If your program does not terminate, the verdict of your submission is undefined.&quot;:1,&quot;After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square $$$(i,j)$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid.\n\nIf you recieve $$$-1$$$ instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than $$$40$$$ queries.\n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \&quot;! $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ $$$p$$$ $$$q$$$\&quot; $$$(1 \\leq x \\leq p\\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq y \\leq q\\leq 10^9)$$$, where $$$(x, y)$$$ is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ coordinates, and $$$(p, q)$$$ is the square inside the enemy base with the largest $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

Each of the $$$N$$$ lines consists of $$$N$$$ characters. The $$$c$$$-th character of the $$$r$$$-th line represents the colour of cell $$$(r, c)$$$ in your paper. The character should be 1 if $$$(r, c)$$$ is coloured black, or 0 if coloured white.\n\nThe demon will reply with one line consisting of a string, which can be read through standard input.\n\n- If the string is CORRECT, then you win the current round and the next round (if exists) will immediately start.\n- If the string is INCORRECT, then the demon will give you $$$N - 2$$$ more lines which can be read through standard input. Each of the $$$N - 2$$$ lines consists of $$$N - 2$$$ characters, representing the binary result grid as explained in the description.\n\nThe demon prepares the secret paper before the start of each round. In other words, the grader is NOT adaptive. There will be at least one hole in the secret paper.\n\nThe total number of queries across all $$$333$$$ rounds should not exceed $$$999$$$. If you exceed the maximum number of queries, you should terminate your program with $$$0$$$ to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. If you do not terminate, the judging result would be undefined because your program is reading from a closed stream.\n\nDo not forget to flush output buffers after each output. In C you can use fflush(stdout). In C++ you can use fflush(stdout) or cout « flush. In Java you can use method flush for output stream, for example, System.out.flush().

Note that if you exceed $$$d$$$ queries, the interaction will continue normally unless you also exceed the $$$500$$$ query hard limit, though you will still receive a Wrong Answer verdict either way.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack a solution, use the following format.\n\nThe first line contains the integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$).\n\nThe second line contains the the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).&quot;:1,&quot;In each test case, you should print the queen's starting cell immediately. If you placed the queen at the king's cell, you will win immediately.\n\nAfter that, you may make at most $$$130$$$ moves. Each move is made in the format $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$, where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are two integers ($$$1 \\leq x,y \\leq 8$$$) that denote the new row and column of the queen respectively. Your move should be a valid queen move.\n\nAfter the initial queen placement and after each move you will receive a string $$$s$$$ that represents the direction of the king's move. It will be one of the following: \&quot;Right\&quot;, \&quot;Left\&quot;, \&quot;Up\&quot;, \&quot;Down\&quot;, \&quot;Down-Right\&quot;, \&quot;Down-Left\&quot;, \&quot;Up-Left\&quot;, \&quot;Up-Right\&quot;, or \&quot;Done\&quot; if you win the game.

The next line should contain $$$n$$$ space-separated integers in the range $$$[0, n-1]$$$ — the array $$$a$$$.&quot;:2,&quot;In each round, your program needs to read one line containing a single integer pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ c), indicating the number given to Chtholly.\n\nYour program should then output a line containing an integer between 1 and n, indicating the number of sheet to write down this number in.\n\nAfter outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. For example:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C/C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nIf Chtholly wins at the end of a round, no more input will become available and your program should terminate normally. It can be shown that under the constraints, it's always possible for Chtholly to win the game.&quot;:1,&quot;To ask a question use the format \&quot;? s\&quot; (without quotes), where s is a query string.

The answer to this question is the number of cards player $$$q$$$ has now ($$$1 \\le q \\le n$$$). The shuffling process starts immediately after your first question, so the answer to the first one is always equal to $$$k$$$.\n\nOnce you have identified the impostor, you can output the answer by printing \&quot;! $$$p$$$\&quot;, where $$$p$$$ is the player who is the impostor ($$$1 \\le p \\le n$$$). Then you have to terminate your program.\n\nYou have to find the impostor by asking no more than $$$1000$$$ questions.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

The i-th integer in this line represents the minimum value of Mi, wj where j is between 1 and k.\n\nYou may only ask a question at most 20 times, otherwise, you will get Wrong Answer.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacking To hack someone, use the following format\n\nOf course, contestant programs will not be able to see this input.&quot;:1,&quot;Before giving the answer, you may submit no more than $$$2$$$ queries. To ask a query, print one line in the following format: $$$?$$$ $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ ... $$$a_{100}$$$, where every $$$a_j$$$ should be an integer from the range $$$[0, 2^{14} - 1]$$$. The line should be ended with a line break character. After submitting a query, flush the output and read the answer to your query — the value of $$$a_i \\oplus x$$$ for some $$$i \\in [1, 100]$$$. No integer can be used in queries more than once.\n\nIf you submit an incorrect query (or ask more than $$$2$$$ queries), the answer to it will be one integer $$$-1$$$. After receiving such an answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict \&quot;Runtime error\&quot;, \&quot;Time limit exceeded\&quot; or some other verdict instead of \&quot;Wrong answer\&quot;.&quot;:1,&quot;If the operation is a query, you should output the result of the query and flush the output stream before proceeding to the next operation. Otherwise, you may get the verdict Idleness Limit Exceed.\n\nFor flushing the output stream, please refer to the documentation of your chosen programming language. The flush functions of some common programming languages are listed below:\n\n- C: fflush(stdout);\n- C++: cout « flush;\n- Java: System.out.flush();&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $$$n$$$.\n\nTo make a query, output \&quot;? a b\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq 2^n$$$) without quotes. Afterwards, you should read one single integer — the answer for your query. You can make at most $$$\\left \\lceil \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2^{n + 1} \\right \\rceil$$$ such queries in each test case.\n\nIf you receive the integer $$$-1$$$ instead of an answer or a valid value of $$$n$$$, it means your program has made an invalid query, has exceed the limit of queries, or has given incorrect answer on the previous test case. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you are ready to give the final answer, output \&quot;! x\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 2^n$$$) without quotes — the winner of the tournament. Giving this answer does not count towards the limit of queries. After solving a test case, your program should move to the next one immediately. After solving all test cases, your program should be terminated immediately.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

There should be a sequence of matches that is consistent with the number of wins.\n\nThe sum of $$$2^n$$$ should not exceed $$$2^{17}$$$.&quot;:1,&quot;To make a query of the first type, print ? i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), where i is the index of element you want to know information about.\n\nAfter each query of type ? read two integers valuei and nexti (0 ≤ valuei ≤ 109,  - 1 ≤ nexti ≤ n, nexti ≠ 0).\n\nIt is guaranteed that if nexti ≠  - 1, then valuenexti > valuei, and that the array values give a valid singly linked list with start being the first element.\n\nNote that you can't ask more than 1999 queries of the type ?.\n\nIf nexti =  - 1 and valuei =  - 1, then it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. Your program should immediately terminate (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive \&quot;Wrong Answer\&quot;, it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution will get \&quot;Idleness Limit Exceeded\&quot;, if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output, including the final answer.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing a query and line end):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- For other languages see documentation.\n\nHacks format\n\nFor hacks, use the following format:\n\nIn the first line print three integers n, start, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ start ≤ n, 0 ≤ x ≤ 109).\n\nIn the next n lines print the description of the elements of the list: in the i-th line print two integers valuei and nexti (0 ≤ valuei ≤ 109,  - 1 ≤ nexti ≤ n, nexti ≠ 0).\n\nThe printed structure should be a valid singly linked list. In particular, it should be possible to reach all elements from start by following links nexti, and the last element end should have -1 in the nextend.&quot;:1,&quot;The interaction between your program and the jury's program begins with reading two positive even integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq k^2 \\leq 2500$$$) – the length of the chosen array and the length of the query subarray, respectively.\n\nTo find the value of $$$a_i \\oplus a_{i + 1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{i + k - 1}$$$, print the query in the format $$$?$$$ $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - k + 1$$$). Then read a single integer – the answer to your query.\n\nYou can make no more than $$$100$$$ queries. When you are ready to print the answer, output it in the format $$$!$$$ $$$x$$$. After that, proceed to process the next test case or terminate the program if it was the last test case. Printing the answer does not count as one of the $$$100$$$ queries.\n\nIf your program makes more than $$$100$$$ queries for one set of input data, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be -1. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

The first line contains the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ – the length of the chosen array and the length of the query subarray, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ – the array that the jury should choose for this test case.&quot;:1,&quot;First, your program must read two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le t \\le \\min(n, 10^4)$$$).\n\nThen $$$t$$$ lines follow, each of which contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that at the moment of the request the array contains at least $$$k$$$ zeros. In order to get the next value of $$$k$$$, you must output the answer for the previous value of $$$k$$$.\n\nAfter that, you can make no more than $$$6 \\cdot 10^4$$$ requests in total.\n\nUse the following format to output the answer (it is not a request, it doesn't count in $$$6 \\cdot 10^4$$$):\n\n- ! $$$x$$$ — position of the $$$k$$$-th zero.\n\nPositions in the array are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ inclusive.\n\nAfter printing $$$t$$$ answers, your program should exit immediately.\n\nIn this task, the interactor is not adaptive. This means that within the same test, the hidden array and the queries do not change.\n\nIn case of an incorrect query, -1 will be displayed. When this value is received, your program must immediately exit normally (for example, by calling exit(0)), otherwise, the testing system may issue an arbitrary verdict.\n\nIf the number of requests is exceeded, the verdict wrong answer will be displayed.\n\nYour solution may get the verdict Idleness limit exceeded if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output buffer.\n\nTo flush the output buffer, you need to do the following immediately after the query output and the end-of-line character:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C ++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nUse the following format for hacks:\n\nOn the first line print the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of zeros and ones, and an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le \\min(|s|, 10^4)$$$) — hidden array and number of requests, respectively. In the next $$$t$$$ lines output the number $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le |s|$$$).\n\nThe hacked solution will not have direct access to the hidden array.&quot;:1,&quot;You will be given multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 5$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of coins. If you read in a value of $$$-1$$$ here, that means that you printed an invalid answer in the previous case and exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nTo ask a question, print \&quot;Q $$$k\\ x_1\\ y_1\\ \\ldots\\ x_k\\ y_k$$$\&quot; ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n/2, 1 \\leq x_i,y_i \\leq n, x_i \\neq y_i$$$). $$$k$$$ denotes the number of pairs in the batch, and $$$x_i, y_i$$$ denote the $$$i$$$-th pair of coins in the batch. A coin can only appear at most once in a batch. All $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ should be distinct.\n\nThe judge will respond with a bitstring of length $$$k$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th character is \&quot;1\&quot; if $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are the same color, and \&quot;0\&quot; otherwise. The judge will respond with $$$-1$$$ if you ever ask an invalid query. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print four lines.\n\nThe first line contains \&quot;A $$$k_1\\ k_2\\ k_3$$$\&quot; ($$$0 \\leq k_1,k_2,k_3$$$ and $$$k_1+k_2+k_3 = n$$$). These denote the sizes of the three piles.\n\nThe next line has $$$k_1$$$ integers, the labels of the coins in the first pile.\n\nThe next line has $$$k_2$$$ integers, the labels of the coins in the second pile.\n\nThe next line has $$$k_3$$$ integers, the labels coins in the third pile.\n\nEach coin must appear in exactly one pile.\n\nYou may only ask at most $$$7$$$ batches per test case.\n\nAfter printing a query and the answer do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

After that, rats $$$a_m$$$ and $$$b_m$$$, $$$a_{m-1}$$$ and $$$b_{m-1}$$$, ..., $$$a_1$$$ and $$$b_1$$$ bite each other. When two rats bite each other, they have a union of their infections.\nI claim that the number of infections of $$$i$$$-th vertex, in the end, is equal to the required value.\nSo on the tree, it is easy to see that the infections are not intersecting when two rats bite each other, so they just change the number to sum.\nBut on the cactus, they may have some non-empty intersection.\nNow, it is easy to see that:\n• Let's say that $$$f_i$$$ is equal to the number of infections of $$$a_i$$$ (same as the number of infections of $$$b_i$$$) after the moment when you meet this edge.\n• Similar to the tree case, when $$$i$$$-th edge connects different connected components, $$$f_i$$$ is just equal to the sum of the number of infections.\n• When $$$i$$$-th edge connects same connected components, $$$f_i$$$ is equal to the sum of the number of infections (let's call this value $$$x$$$). Or $$$f_i$$$ is equal to $$$x - f_e$$$ where $$$e$$$ is some edge on the path between $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ (note that it is a cactus, so this path is unique).\n• This $$$e$$$ is always the largest edge on the path, and it is subtracted if and only if the path from it to $$$a_i$$$ and from it to $$$b_i$$$ is decreasing.\nSo, we can solve the problem in $$$O(n+m)$$$.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819/A&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;820/C&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;820/C\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Codeforces Round 421 (Div. 1)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1498574100,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,498,574,100&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2017,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,017&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mister B and Boring Game&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sometimes Mister B has free evenings when he doesn't know what to do.

Mister B moves first.\n\nMister B must append exactly b letters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly a letters on each move.\n\nMister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of string s of length a and generates a string t of length a such that all letters in the string t are distinct and don't appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants of t lexicographically minimal is chosen (if a = 4 and the suffix is \&quot;bfdd\&quot;, the computer chooses string t equal to \&quot;aceg\&quot;). After that the chosen string t is appended to the end of s.\n\nMister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in string s on the segment between positions l and r, inclusive.

At first all di = 0.\nThen pk affects it in following way:\n• d0 +  = |pk - k|,\n• d1 +  = |pk - (k + 1)|,\n• ...\n• dn - k +  = |pk - n|,\n• dn - k + 1 +  = |pk - 1|,\n• ...\n• dn - 1 +  = |pk - (k - 1)|.\nThen there are 2 cases: pk ≥ k or not.\nIf pk ≥ k after removing modules we will get 3 query:\n• to add pk - (k + i) to di where 0 ≤ i ≤ pk - k,\n• to add (k + i) - pk to di where pk - k < i ≤ n - k and\n• to add pk - i to dn - k + i where 0 < i < k.\nElse if pk < k we need to perform next operation:\n• to add (k + i) - pk to di where 0 ≤ i ≤ n - k,\n• to add pk - i to dn - k + i where 1 ≤ i ≤ pk and\n• to add i - pk to dn - k + i where pk < i < k.\nBut in both cases we must add 3 arithmetic progression to the segment of array d. Or make operation of adding k·(x - l) + b to segment [l, r]. Its known task, which can be done by adding/subtracting values in start and end of segment offline.\nTo make such operation we need to remember, how to add value b to segment [l, r] of array d offline. We can just do next operations: d[l] +  = b and d[r + 1] -  = b. Now value in position i $$ans_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{j=i} d[j]$$.\nSo what is adding progression with coef k? it's only adding to array d value k to all positions in segment [l, r]. That's why we need other array, for example df and making df[l] +  = k and df[r + 1] -  = k. In result, $$d[i] = d[i] + \\sum_{j=0}^{j=i-1} df[j]$$.\nSo algorithm to add k·(x - l) + b to segment [l, r] is next:\n• d[l] +  = b,\n• d[r + 1] -  = k·(r - l + 1),\n• df[l] +  = k,\n• df[r + 1] -  = k.\nAfter all queries we need recover array d with formula $$d[i] = d[i] + \\sum_{j=0}^{j=i-1} df[j]$$. And after that get answer with formula $$ans_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{j=i} d[j]$$.\nSo complexity is O(n).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819/C&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;820/E&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;820/E\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Codeforces Round 421 (Div. 1)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1498574100,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,498,574,100&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2017,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,017&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;C&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mister B and Beacons on Field&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mister B has a house in the middle of a giant plain field, which attracted aliens life. For convenience, aliens specified the Cartesian coordinate system on the field in such a way that Mister B's house has coordinates (0, 0). After that they sent three beacons to the field, but something went wrong. One beacon was completely destroyed, while the other two landed in positions with coordinates (m, 0) and (0, n), respectively, but shut down.\n\nMister B was interested in this devices, so he decided to take them home. He came to the first beacon, placed at (m, 0), lifted it up and carried the beacon home choosing the shortest path.

Moreover, Mister B learned that the star shines once in exactly T seconds. The problem is that the star is yet to be discovered by scientists.\n\nThere are n astronomers numerated from 1 to n trying to detect the star. They try to detect the star by sending requests to record the sky for 1 second.\n\nThe astronomers send requests in cycle: the i-th astronomer sends a request exactly ai second after the (i - 1)-th (i.e. if the previous request was sent at moment t, then the next request is sent at moment t + ai); the 1-st astronomer sends requests a1 seconds later than the n-th. The first astronomer sends his first request at moment 0.\n\nMister B doesn't know the first moment the star is going to shine, but it's obvious that all moments at which the star will shine are determined by the time of its shine moment in the interval [0, T). Moreover, this interval can be split into T parts of 1 second length each of form [t, t + 1), where t = 0, 1, 2, ..., (T - 1).\n\nMister B wants to know how lucky each astronomer can be in discovering the star first.\n\nFor each astronomer compute how many segments of form [t, t + 1) (t = 0, 1, 2, ..., (T - 1)) there are in the interval [0, T) so that this astronomer is the first to discover the star if the first shine of the star happens in this time interval.&quot;},&quot;input_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The first line contains two integers T and n (1 ≤ T ≤ 109, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).&quot;},&quot;output_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Print n integers: for each astronomer print the number of time segments describer earlier.&quot;},&quot;interaction_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In the first sample test the first astronomer will send requests at moments t1 = 0, 5, 10, ..., the second — at moments t2 = 3, 8, 13, ....

We can see, that, at first, all operation with time are modulo T and the i - th astronomer checks moments sti, (sti + s)%T, (sti + 2s)%T ..., where $$st_i = \\sum_{j=2}^{i} a_j$$. More over, every astronomer, who checks moment t will check moment (t + S)%T by next time.\nSo we now constructed functional graph with T vertices. But this graph has very special type, since it can be divided on some cycles. More specifically, This graph consists of gcd(T, s) oriented cycles and each cycle has length exactly $$\\frac{T}{gcd(T,s)}$$. Even more, vertices u and v belong to same cycle iff u ≡ v (mod gcd(T, s)).\nSo we can work with cycles independently.\nLet's look closely on one cycle. It's obviously, that all astronomers will walk on their cycles from their starting positions sti % T. But what the answer for them.\nAnswer for the i - th astronomer is number of vertices, including starting vertex, to the nearest starting vertex of any other astronomer if count along the orientation of cycle, because if two astronomers came to same vertex, lucky is one, who came first. Other astronomer has this vertex as start, his time is stj, i - th time is sti + k·s, k ≥ 1 and sti + k·s > stj. If sti ≡  stj (mod T) and sti < stj then answer for the j - th astronomer is always 0.\nSo we must effectively calculate distance between two positions on cycle.\nFor that, let's numerate vertices along the orientation of cycle using vertex with minimal label as 0. If we will know position of sti% T for every astronomer calculation of distance between consecutive is trivial (sort, or set or other).\nFor the i - th astronomer let's denote vertex with label 0 in his cycle as zi. zi = sti % gcd(T, s). But cycles very specific, because vertex with label 0 is zi, vertex with label 1 is (zi + s) % T, vertex with label 2 is (zi + 2s) % T. In other words, vertex with label k is (zi + k·s) % T.\nIf we want to know position k of sti, we need to find v such, that v ≡  (v% gcd(T, s)) + k·s(mod T) which is diofant equation and can be calculated in O(log(T)) time.\nResult complexity is O(n·log(T)).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819/E&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;819&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Codeforces Round 421 (Div. 1)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1498574100,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,498,574,100&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2017,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,017&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;E&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mister B and Flight to the Moon&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In order to fly to the Moon Mister B just needs to solve the following problem.\n\nThere is a complete indirected graph with n vertices.

Instead of triangle 1-2-x let's add triangle 1-a-2-x, square 1-a-2-b and square 1-2-b. The same with 3-4-y, 5-6-z and so on. Only one edge a-b is remaining, we should add it twice. To do this let's replace the square 1-a-2-b with triangles a-b-1 and a-b-2. Easy to see that the condition on triangles is satisfied, so we can proceed to adding two more vertices and so on.\nTo deal with odd n let's keep triangles 2-3-x, 4-5-y and so on. To add two more vertices replace each of these triangles with two squares and one triangle in the same way as for even n, and also add two triangles 1-a-b.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;465/A&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;465&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Codeforces Round 265 (Div. 2)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1410103800,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,410,103,800&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2014,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,014&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;inc ARG&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sergey is testing a next-generation processor.

Because we can \&quot;remove\&quot; exactly one non-zero digit in $$$n$$$ using exactly one round number (so we need at most this amount of round numbers) and, on the other hand, the sum of two round numbers has at most two non-zero digits (the sum of three round numbers has at most three non-zero digits and so on) so this is useless to try to remove more than one digit using the sum of several round numbers.\nSo we need to find all digits of $$$n$$$ and print the required number for each of these digits. For example, if $$$n=103$$$ then $$$n=1 \\cdot 10^2 + 0 \\cdot 10^1 + 3 \\cdot 10^0$$$, so we need two round numbers: $$$1 \\cdot 10^2$$$ and $$$3 \\cdot 10^0$$$.\nBecause the last digit of $$$n$$$ is $$$n \\% 10$$$ (the remainder of $$$n$$$ modulo $$$10$$$) and we can remove the last digit of the number by integer division on $$$10$$$, we can use the following code to solve the problem:&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1347/D&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;1352/D&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;1352/D\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1347&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Kotlin Heroes: Practice 4&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ICPC&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1590154500,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,590,154,500&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2020,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,020&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;D&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alice, Bob and Candies&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There are $$$n$$$ candies in a row, they are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

If there are not enough candies to make a move this way, then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends.\n\nFor example, if $$$n=11$$$ and $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$$$, then:\n\n- move 1: Alice eats one candy of size $$$3$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$$$.\n- move 2: Alice ate $$$3$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$4$$$ or more. Bob eats one candy of size $$$5$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3]$$$.\n- move 3: Bob ate $$$5$$$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $$$6$$$ or more. Alice eats three candies with the total size of $$$1+4+1=6$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[5,9,2,6,5,3]$$$.\n- move 4: Alice ate $$$6$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$7$$$ or more. Bob eats two candies with the total size of $$$3+5=8$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[5,9,2,6]$$$.\n- move 5: Bob ate $$$8$$$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $$$9$$$ or more. Alice eats two candies with the total size of $$$5+9=14$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[2,6]$$$.\n- move 6 (the last): Alice ate $$$14$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$15$$$ or more. It is impossible, so Bob eats the two remaining candies and the game ends.\n\nPrint the number of moves in the game and two numbers:\n\n- $$$a$$$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Alice during the game;\n- $$$b$$$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Bob during the game.&quot;},&quot;input_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input.

I'll describe $$$O(n)$$$ solution anyway.\nFirstly, we need to maintain several variables: $$$cnt$$$ (initially $$$0$$$, the number of moves passed), $$$l$$$ (the position of the leftmost remaining candy, initially $$$0$$$), $$$r$$$ (the position of the rightmost remaining candy, initially $$$n-1$$$), $$$ansl$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Alice, initially $$$0$$$), $$$ansr$$$ (the sum of candied eaten by Bob, initially $$$0$$$), $$$suml$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Alice during her last move, initially $$$0$$$) and $$$sumr$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Bob during his last move, initially $$$0$$$).\nSo, let's just simulate the following process while $$$l \\le r$$$: if the number of moves $$$cnt$$$ is even then now is Alice's move and we need to maintain one more variable $$$nsuml = 0$$$ — the sum of candies Alice eats during this move. How to calculate it? While $$$l \\le r$$$ and $$$nsuml \\le sumr$$$, let's eat the leftmost candy, so variables will change like this: $$$nsuml := nsuml + a_l, l := l + 1$$$. After all, let's add $$$nsuml$$$ to $$$ansl$$$, replace $$$suml$$$ with $$$nsuml$$$ (assign $$$suml := nsuml$$$) and increase $$$cnt$$$ by $$$1$$$. If the number of moves $$$cnt$$$ is odd then the process is the same but from the Bob's side.\nI'll also add a simply implemented $$$O(n^2)$$$ solution written by Gassa below :)&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1347/E&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;1352/G&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;1352/G\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1347&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Kotlin Heroes: Practice 4&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ICPC&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1590154500,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,590,154,500&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2020,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,020&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;E&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Special Permutation&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$p=[p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n]$$$, which contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once.

You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.\n\nNote, that you have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.&quot;},&quot;input_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.\n\nThe second line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ over all queries does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.&quot;},&quot;output_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;For each test case print one integer in single line — the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $$$a$$$.&quot;},&quot;interaction_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $$$a_{1 \\ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \\ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \\ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \\ldots 5} = [2, 2]$$$.\n\nIn the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarray — $$$a_{3 \\ldots 4}$$$.\n\nIn the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $$$a_{1 \\ldots 8}, a_{2 \\ldots 5}, a_{2 \\ldots 7}, a_{2 \\ldots 9}, a_{3 \\ldots 4}, a_{6 \\ldots 7}, a_{6 \\ldots 9}, a_{8 \\ldots 9}$$$.&quot;},&quot;examples&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;input&quot;:&quot;3\n5\n2 1 1 2 2\n6\n1 2 1 1 3 2\n9\n3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3&quot;,&quot;output&quot;:&quot;4\n1\n8&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;input\&quot;: \&quot;3\\n5\\n2 1 1 2 2\\n6\\n1 2 1 1 3 2\\n9\\n3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3\&quot;,\n    \&quot;output\&quot;: \&quot;4\\n1\\n8\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;editorial&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Let's understand how calculate the array $$$nxt$$$, such that $$$nxt_l$$$ is equal to the minimum index $$$r > l$$$ such that subarray $$$a_{l \\dots r}$$$ is stack exterminable. If there is no such index, then $$$nxt_l = -1$$$.\nIf we calculate this array then we solve this task by simple dynamic programming.\nLet's calculate it in order $$$nxt_n, nxt_{n-1}, \\dots , nxt_1$$$ by dynamic programming. At first consider simple case. If $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$, then $$$nxt_i = i + 1$$$. Otherwise we have to \&quot;add\&quot; the block $$$a_{i+1} \\dots a_{nxt_{i+1}}$$$ (of course, $$$nxt_{i + 1}$$$ should be not equal to $$$-1$$$) and check that $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{i + 1}}$$$. If this ($$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{i + 1}}$$$) also is not true, then you have to add a new block $$$a_{1 + nxt_{i+1}} \\dots a_{nxt_{1 + nxt_{i+1}}}$$$ and check the condition $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{1 + nxt_{i+1}}}$$$. If this condition also is not try, then you have to add a new block and so on.\nIt is correct solution, but it can be too slowly. Let's understand, that we add blocks to $$$a_i$$$ until condition $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{\\dots}}$$$ is holds. Let's assume, that we have an array $$$nxtX$$$ (this array contains a hashMaps, for example you can use map in C++), such that $$$nxtX_{i, x}$$$ is is equal to the minimum index $$$r > l$$$ such that subarray $$$a_{l \\dots r}$$$ is stack exterminable and $$$x = a_{r + 1}$$$. Then we can easily calculate the value $$$nxt_i = nxtX_{i+1, a_i} + 1$$$. Remains to understand, how to calculate $$$nxtX_{i}$$$. For this we just can make an assignment $$$nxtX_{i} = nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$. And then update $$$nxtX_{i, a_{nxt_i + 1}} = nxt_{i} + 1$$$.\nBut I deceived you a little. We can't make an assignment $$$nxtX_{i} = nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$ because it is to slow. Instead that you need to swap elements $$$nxtX_{i}$$$ and $$$nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$, this can be done using the function $$$swap$$$ in C++ or Java (time complexity of $$$swap$$$ if $$$O(1)$$$).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1223/G&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;1240/E&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;1240/E\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1223&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Technocup 2020 - Elimination Round 1&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1570374300,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,570,374,300&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2019,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,019&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;G&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Wooden Raft&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Suppose you are stuck on a desert island.

Such raft would have the area equal to $$$x \\cdot y$$$. Both $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ must be integers since it's the only way you can measure the lengths while being on a desert island.

And let's try to find the best answer for a fixed $$$y$$$ in $$$O(\\frac{A}{y})$$$ time.\nHow to do so? At first, we can quite easily calculate the total number of logs of length $$$y$$$ we can acquire (denote it as $$$cntY$$$): since all $$$a_i \\in [ky, ky + y)$$$ give the same number of logs which is equal to $$$k$$$, then let's just count the number of $$$a_i$$$ in $$$[ky, ky + y)$$$ for each $$$k$$$. We can do so using frequency array and prefix sums on it.\nThere are two cases in the problem: both logs of length $$$x$$$ lies in the same log $$$a_i$$$ or from the different logs $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. In the first case it's the same as finding one log of length $$$2x$$$. But in both cases we will divide all possible values of $$$x$$$ ($$$2x$$$) in segments $$$[ky, ky + y)$$$ and check each segment in $$$O(1)$$$ time.\nLet's suppose that $$$2x \\in [ky, ky + y)$$$ and there is $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$a_i \\ge 2x$$$ and $$$(a_i \\mod y) \\ge (2x \\mod y)$$$. In that case it's optimal to cut $$$2x$$$ from $$$a_i$$$ and, moreover, it's optimal to increase $$$2x$$$ while we can. It leads us straight to the solution, let's keep $$$\\max(a_i \\mod y)$$$ over $$$a_i \\ge ky$$$ and check only $$$2x = ky + \\max(a_i \\mod y)$$$ (maybe minus one in case of wrong parity). We can maintain this max iterating $$$k$$$ in descending order. And since $$$\\max(a_i \\mod y)$$$ for all $$$a_i \\in [ky, ky + y)$$$ is just a $$$\\max(a_i~|~a_i < ky + y)$$$. We can find such $$$a_i$$$ in $$$O(1)$$$ using precalc. To check the chosen $$$2x$$$ is trivial: the number of remaining logs $$$y$$$ is equal to $$$cntY - k$$$ and the plot will have the area $$$y \\cdot \\min(x, cntY - k)$$$.\nThe case with cutting $$$x$$$-s from different $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is based on the same idea, but we need to maintain two maximums $$$mx1$$$ and $$$mx2$$$ ($$$mx1 \\ge mx2$$$). But in this case $$$x$$$ can be equal to both $$$mx1$$$ or $$$mx2$$$.\nIf $$$x = ky + mx2$$$ then everything is trivial: the number of logs $$$y$$$ is $$$cntY - 2 \\cdot k$$$ and so on. If $$$x = ky + mx1$$$ then we need to additional check the existence of $$$a_i \\ge x$$$ and $$$a_j \\ge x$$$. Remaining number of logs $$$y$$$ will be equal to $$$cntY - 2 \\cdot k - 1$$$ and so on.\nIn result, for each $$$y$$$ we can calculate the answer in $$$O(\\frac{A}{y})$$$, so the total time complexity is $$$O(n + \\sum_{y = 2}^{A}{O(\\frac{A}{y})}) = O(n + A \\log A)$$$.\nP.S.: We decided to allow the $$$O(A \\log^2 A)$$$ solution which binary search $$$x$$$ for each $$$y$$$ to pass if it's carefully written.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;501/A&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;501&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Codeforces Round 285 (Div. 2)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1421053200,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,421,053,200&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2015,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,015&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Contest&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Misha and Vasya participated in a Codeforces contest.

Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms.\n\nGreg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself).

The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k.\n\nAlso Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides.

First, output the integer $$$\\alpha$$$ — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot).\n\nThen output $$$k$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the $$$i$$$-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be $$$\\alpha + a_i$$$.&quot;},&quot;input_format&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.\n\nThen follow $$$k$$$ lines, each containing two numbers $$$r_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le c_i \\le m$$$) — the coordinates of the cell with the $$$i$$$-th fountain.

It was the leftmost corner that came before fountain $$$j$$$, and the next corner in sorted order will be strictly higher.\nThus, we need to do the following: for each corner, calculate the area without considering it until the next corner, and this will be helped by the precalculation we did when calculating the area.

This can be done by depth-first traversal in $$$O(n)$$$.\nNow let's learn how to solve the problem in $$$O(n)$$$ for each query. The first type of query can be executed straightforwardly. Notice that due to the properties of the xor operation, the values will only change for vertices at odd depth (the depth of the root is $$$0$$$). At the same time, they will change trivially: they will be xored with $$$y$$$. To answer the second query, it is necessary to realize that the xor on a simple cycle $$$v \\to \\text{lca}(v, u) \\to u \\to v$$$ is equal to $$$d_v \\oplus d_u \\oplus x$$$. Indeed, the path from $$$\\text{lca(v, u)}$$$ to the root will be counted twice, so it will turn into $$$0$$$, and no other extra edges will be included in this xor. With due skill, you can try to speed up such a solution with AVX instructions, but the time constraints were chosen strictly.\nFor a complete solution to the problem, you can use the data structure prefix tree (trie). With its help, you can find in $$$O(\\log x)$$$ for the number $$$x$$$ such a $$$y$$$ in the set, that $$$x \\oplus y$$$ is maximal. Since $$$d_v$$$ change differently, you will have to use two tries — for vertices at even and odd heights. Operations of the first type can be accumulated in the variable $$$w_\\text{odd}$$$ and added to the xor expression. In addition, you must not forget to remove $$$d_v$$$ from the necessary trie when answering the second query, and then insert it back. To do this, you can maintain a counter of terminal leaves in each vertex and use this information during descent.\nThus, the final asymptotic is $$$O((n + m) \\log 10^9)$$$.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:53,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1498/A&quot;},&quot;aliases&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;null&quot;},&quot;contest_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1498&quot;},&quot;contest_name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CodeCraft-21 and Codeforces Round 711 (Div. 2)&quot;},&quot;contest_type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CF&quot;},&quot;contest_start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1617028500,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,617,028,500&quot;},&quot;contest_start_year&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2021,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,021&quot;},&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A&quot;},&quot;time_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;memory_limit&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:256,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;256&quot;},&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;GCD Sum&quot;},&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The $$$\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of a positive integer is the $$$gcd$$$ of that integer with its sum of digits.

If a particle has decay age equal to $$$1$$$, it will NOT produce a copy.\n\nFor example, if there are two planes and a particle is shot with decay age $$$3$$$ (towards the right), the process is as follows: (here, $$$D(x)$$$ refers to a single particle with decay age $$$x$$$)\n\n1. the first plane produces a $$$D(2)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(3)$$$ continue on to the right;\n2. the second plane produces a $$$D(2)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(3)$$$ continue on to the right;\n3. the first plane lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the left and produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the right;\n4. the second plane lets $$$D(1)$$$ continue on to the right ($$$D(1)$$$ cannot produce any copies).\n\nIn total, the final multiset $$$S$$$ of particles is $$$\\{D(3), D(2), D(2), D(1)\\}$$$.

Note that the vertical spacing between reflected particles is for visual clarity only (as mentioned before, no two distinct particles collide with each other)\n\nTest case 2: ($$$n = 2$$$, $$$k = 2$$$) is explained as follows:\n\n1. the first plane produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the right;\n2. the second plane produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the right;\n3. the first plane lets $$$D(1)$$$ continue on to the left ($$$D(1)$$$ cannot produce any copies).\n\nTotal size of multiset obtained $$$\\{D(1), D(1), D(2)\\}$$$ is equal to three.\n\nTest case 3: ($$$n = 3$$$, $$$k = 1$$$), there are three planes, but decay age is only one. So no new copies are produced while the one particle passes through the planes. Hence, the answer is one.\n\nTest case 4: ($$$n = 1$$$, $$$k = 3$$$) there is only one plane.

There is  exactly one directed road between every pair of houses. For example, consider two houses A and B, then there is a directed road either from A to B or from B to A but not both. The number of roads leading to the $$$i$$$-th house is $$$k_i$$$.\n\nTwo houses A and B are bi-reachable if A is reachable from B and B is reachable from A. We say that house B is reachable from house A when there is a path from house A to house B.\n\nDixit wants to buy two houses in the city, that is, one for living and one for studying. Of course, he would like to travel from one house to another. So, he wants to find a pair of bi-reachable houses A and B. Among all such pairs, he wants to choose one with the maximum value of $$$|k_A - k_B|$$$, where $$$k_i$$$ is the number of roads leading to the house $$$i$$$. If more than one optimal pair exists, any of them is suitable.\n\nSince Dixit is busy preparing CodeCraft, can you help him find the desired pair of houses, or tell him that no such houses exist?\n\nIn the problem input, you are not given the direction of each road. You are given — for each house — only the number of incoming roads to that house ($$$k_i$$$).\n\nYou are allowed to ask only one type of query from the judge: give two houses A and B, and the judge answers whether B is reachable from A. There is no upper limit on the number of queries. But, you cannot ask more queries after the judge answers \&quot;Yes\&quot; to any of your queries.

He wrote a very big positive integer A0 on a piece of paper. The number is less than 10200000 . In each step, Jack is allowed to put ' + ' signs in between some of the digits (maybe none) of the current number and calculate the sum of the expression. He can perform the same procedure on that sum and so on. The resulting sums can be labeled respectively by A1, A2 etc. His task is to get to a single digit number.

The problem is that there is not much blank space on the paper. There are only three lines of space, so he can't perform more than three steps. Since he wants to fill up the paper completely, he will perform exactly three steps.

Jack must not add leading zeros to intermediate results, but he can put ' + ' signs in front of digit 0. For example, if the current number is 1000100, 10 + 001 + 00 is a valid step, resulting in number 11.</span></div></div>

There are exactly L layers, each having N cities. Let us look at the two adjacent layers L1 and L2. Each city from the layer L1 is connected to each city from the layer L2 with the traveling cost cij for $$i,j\in\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$$, and each pair of adjacent layers has the same cost in between their cities as any other pair (they just stacked the same layers, as usual). Also, the traveling costs to each city from the layer L2 are same for all cities in the L1, that is cij is the same for $$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$$, and fixed j.

Thanks to his revolutionary math discoveries he was able to make enough money to build a beautiful house. Unfortunately, for not paying property tax on time, court decided to punish Bill by making him lose a part of his property.

Bill’s property can be observed as a convex regular 2n-sided polygon A0 A1... A2n - 1 A2n,  A2n =  A0, with sides of the exactly 1 meter in length.

Court rules for removing part of his property are as follows:

- Split every edge Ak Ak + 1,  k = 0... 2n - 1 in n equal parts of size 1 / n with points P0, P1, ..., Pn - 1
- On every edge A2k A2k + 1,  k = 0... n - 1 court will choose one point B2k =  Pi for some i = 0, ...,  n - 1 such that $$\bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{2i} = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} P_i$$
- On every edge A2k + 1A2k + 2,  k = 0...n - 1 Bill will choose one point B2k + 1 =  Pi for some i = 0, ...,  n - 1 such that $$\bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{2i+1} = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} P_i$$
- Bill gets to keep property inside of 2n-sided polygon B0 B1... B2n - 1

Luckily, Bill found out which B2k points the court chose. Even though he is a great mathematician, his house is very big and he has a hard time calculating. Therefore, he is asking you to help him choose points so he maximizes area of property he can keep.</span></div></div>

After exploring the map of Serbia for a while, the competitors came up with the following facts: the country has V cities which are indexed with numbers from 1 to V, and there are E bi-directional roads that connect the cites. Each road has a weight (the time needed to cross that road). There are N teams at the Bubble Cup and the competitors came up with the following plan: each of the N teams will start their journey in one of the V cities, and some of the teams share the starting position.

They want to find the shortest time T, such that every team can move in these T minutes, and the number of different cities they end up in is at least K (because they will only get to know the cities they end up in). A team doesn't have to be on the move all the time, if they like it in a particular city, they can stay there and wait for the time to pass.

Please help the competitors to determine the shortest time T so it's possible for them to end up in at least K different cities or print -1 if that is impossible no matter how they move.

Note that there can exist multiple roads between some cities.</span></div></div>

The second line contains N integers, the cities where the teams start their journey.

Next E lines contain information about the roads in following format: Ai Bi Ti (1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ V,  1 ≤ Ti ≤ 10000), which means that there is a road connecting cities Ai and Bi, and you need Ti minutes to cross that road.</span></div></div>

John first has to select from which city he will start his journey. After that, he spends one day in a city and then travels to a randomly choosen city which is directly connected to his current one and which he has not yet visited. He does this until he can't continue obeying these rules.

To select the starting city, he calls his friend Jack for advice. Jack is also starting a big casino business and wants to open casinos in some of the cities (max 1 per city, maybe nowhere). Jack knows John well and he knows that if he visits a city with a casino, he will gamble exactly once before continuing his journey.

He also knows that if John enters a casino in a good mood, he will leave it in a bad mood and vice versa. Since he is John's friend, he wants him to be in a good mood at the moment when he finishes his journey. John is in a good mood before starting the journey.

In how many ways can Jack select a starting city for John and cities where he will build casinos such that no matter how John travels, he will be in a good mood at the end? Print answer modulo 109 + 7.</span></div></div>

If Jack selects city 2 for start, everything is symmetrical, so the answer is 4.

Example 2: If Jack tells John to start from city 1, he can either build casinos in 0 or 2 cities (total 4 possibilities). If he tells him to start from city 2, then John's journey will either contain cities 2 and 1 or 2 and 3. Therefore, Jack will either have to build no casinos, or build them in all three cities.

Bob got a task to invite N famous singers who would sing on the fest. He was too busy placing stages for their performances that he totally forgot to write the invitation e-mails on time, and unfortunately he only found K available singers. Now there are more stages than singers, leaving some of the stages empty. Bob would not like if citizens of BubbleLand noticed empty stages and found out that he was irresponsible.

Because of that he decided to choose exactly K stages that form a convex set, make large posters as edges of that convex set and hold festival inside. While those large posters will make it impossible for citizens to see empty stages outside Bob still needs to make sure they don't see any of the empty stages inside that area.

Since lots of people are coming, he would like that the festival area is as large as possible. Help him calculate the maximum area that he could obtain respecting the conditions. If there is no such area, the festival cannot be organized and the answer is 0.00.</span></div></div>

I claim that the Young diagram can be partitioned into domino if and only if the number of white cells inside it is equal to the number of black cells inside it.
If the Young diagram has two equal rows (or columns) you can delete one domino, and the diagram will still have an equal number of white and black cells.
If all rows and columns are different, it means that the Young diagram is a "basic" diagram, i.e have lengths of columns $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$.

But in a "basic" diagram the number of white and black cells is different! So, we have a contradiction!
But what if the number of black and white cells are not the same?
I claim that the answer is $$$\min($$$ the number of white cells, the number of black cells $$$)$$$.
Just because if you have more white cells (case with more black case is symmetrical), and there are no equal rows and columns, you can take the first column with more white cells than black cells and delete the last cell of this column, in the end, you will have a Young diagram with an equal number of black and white cells, so you can find the answer by algorithm described below.</span></div></div>

After that, let's say that $$$x \leq k$$$ is one, and $$$x > k$$$ is zero.
Then you need to calculate the smallest number of swaps to make segment $$$1,1,\ldots,1$$$ of length $$$k$$$ appear in the permutation.
For this, let's call $$$p_i$$$ the number of ones on the prefix.
For all $$$s_i=0$$$ we need to add $$$\min{(p_i, k - p_i)}$$$ to the answer (it is an obvious lower bound, and it is simple to prove that we always can do one operation to reduce this total value by one).
How to calculate this for each $$$k$$$?
Let's move $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can maintain number of inversions with BIT. To calculate the second value, you can note that you just need to find $$$\frac{k}{2}$$$-th number $$$\leq k$$$ and add values at the left and add the right with different coefficients. To maintain them, you can recalculate everything when you are moving the median (in heap). But also it is possible to maintain the segment tree by $$$p_i$$$ and just take some sum.</span></div></div>

• Start by proving that for $$$n \geq 4$$$ in the strongly connected tournament it is possible to invert one vertex so it will remain strongly connected, it is possible by induction.
• If there is a big SCC (with at least four vertices), invert good vertex in it.
• If there are at least three strongly connected components, invert random vertex in the middle one.
• If there are two SCCs, then all of them have size $$$\leq 3$$$, so the number of vertices is $$$\leq 6$$$.
So you can check each vertex in $$$O(\frac{n^2}{32})$$$ with bitset. But also it is possible to check that tournament is strongly connected by degree sequence in $$$O(n)$$$. For this, you can note that the degree of each vertex in the rightest SCC is smaller than degrees of all other vertices. So in the sorted by degree order you can check for the prefix of length $$$k$$$, that the number of edges outgoing from them (sum of degrees) is $$$\frac{k(k-1)}{2}+k(n-k)$$$ if there exists $$$k&lt;n$$$ which satisfy this constraint, then it is simple to prove that the graph is not strongly connected.
So, you can solve this problem in $$$O(n^2)$$$ or in $$$O(\frac{n^3}{32})$$$.</span></div></div>

Let's look at edges in the order of decreasing weight.
How $$$dp$$$ is changing when you are looking at edge $$$i$$$?
I claim that $$$dp'_v = dp_v$$$ for $$$v \neq a_i $$$and $$$v \neq b_i$$$.
And $$$dp'_{a_i} = dp'_{b_i} = dp_{a_i} + dp_{b_i}$$$.
Why? I like this thinking about this problem: in each vertex sitting a rat, initially $$$i$$$-th rat is infected by $$$i$$$-th type of infection. After that, rats $$$a_m$$$ and $$$b_m$$$, $$$a_{m-1}$$$ and $$$b_{m-1}$$$, ..., $$$a_1$$$ and $$$b_1$$$ bite each other. When two rats bite each other, they have a union of their infections.
I claim that the number of infections of $$$i$$$-th vertex, in the end, is equal to the required value.
So on the tree, it is easy to see that the infections are not intersecting when two rats bite each other, so they just change the number to sum.
But on the cactus, they may have some non-empty intersection.
Now, it is easy to see that:
• Let's say that $$$f_i$$$ is equal to the number of infections of $$$a_i$$$ (same as the number of infections of $$$b_i$$$) after the moment when you meet this edge.
• Similar to the tree case, when $$$i$$$-th edge connects different connected components, $$$f_i$$$ is just equal to the sum of the number of infections.
• When $$$i$$$-th edge connects same connected components, $$$f_i$$$ is equal to the sum of the number of infections (let's call this value $$$x$$$). Or $$$f_i$$$ is equal to $$$x - f_e$$$ where $$$e$$$ is some edge on the path between $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ (note that it is a cactus, so this path is unique).
• This $$$e$$$ is always the largest edge on the path, and it is subtracted if and only if the path from it to $$$a_i$$$ and from it to $$$b_i$$$ is decreasing.
So, we can solve the problem in $$$O(n+m)$$$.</span></div></div>

All characters in this game are lowercase English letters. There are two players: Mister B and his competitor.

Initially the players have a string s consisting of the first a English letters in alphabetical order (for example, if a = 5, then s equals to "abcde").

The players take turns appending letters to string s. Mister B moves first.

Mister B must append exactly b letters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly a letters on each move.

Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of string s of length a and generates a string t of length a such that all letters in the string t are distinct and don't appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants of t lexicographically minimal is chosen (if a = 4 and the suffix is "bfdd", the computer chooses string t equal to "aceg"). After that the chosen string t is appended to the end of s.

Mister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in string s on the segment between positions l and r, inclusive. Letters of string s are numerated starting from 1.</span></div></div>

If pk ≥ k after removing modules we will get 3 query:
• to add pk - (k + i) to di where 0 ≤ i ≤ pk - k,
• to add (k + i) - pk to di where pk - k &lt; i ≤ n - k and
• to add pk - i to dn - k + i where 0 &lt; i &lt; k.
Else if pk &lt; k we need to perform next operation:
• to add (k + i) - pk to di where 0 ≤ i ≤ n - k,
• to add pk - i to dn - k + i where 1 ≤ i ≤ pk and
• to add i - pk to dn - k + i where pk &lt; i &lt; k.
But in both cases we must add 3 arithmetic progression to the segment of array d. Or make operation of adding k·(x - l) + b to segment [l, r]. Its known task, which can be done by adding/subtracting values in start and end of segment offline.
To make such operation we need to remember, how to add value b to segment [l, r] of array d offline. We can just do next operations: d[l] +  = b and d[r + 1] -  = b. Now value in position i $$ans_i = \sum_{j=0}^{j=i} d[j]$$.
So what is adding progression with coef k? it's only adding to array d value k to all positions in segment [l, r]. That's why we need other array, for example df and making df[l] +  = k and df[r + 1] -  = k. In result, $$d[i] = d[i] + \sum_{j=0}^{j=i-1} df[j]$$.
So algorithm to add k·(x - l) + b to segment [l, r] is next:
• d[l] +  = b,
• d[r + 1] -  = k·(r - l + 1),
• df[l] +  = k,
• df[r + 1] -  = k.
After all queries we need recover array d with formula $$d[i] = d[i] + \sum_{j=0}^{j=i-1} df[j]$$. And after that get answer with formula $$ans_i = \sum_{j=0}^{j=i} d[j]$$.
So complexity is O(n).</span></div></div>

After that they sent three beacons to the field, but something went wrong. One beacon was completely destroyed, while the other two landed in positions with coordinates (m, 0) and (0, n), respectively, but shut down.

Mister B was interested in this devices, so he decided to take them home. He came to the first beacon, placed at (m, 0), lifted it up and carried the beacon home choosing the shortest path. After that he came to the other beacon, placed at (0, n), and also carried it home choosing the shortest path. When first beacon was lifted up, the navigation system of the beacons was activated.

Partially destroyed navigation system started to work in following way.

At time moments when both survived beacons are at points with integer coordinates the system tries to find a location for the third beacon. It succeeds if and only if there is a point with integer coordinates such that the area of the triangle formed by the two survived beacons and this point is equal to s. In this case the system sends a packet of information with beacon positions to aliens, otherwise it doesn't.

But at first we need factorization of n and s. Since n and s are product of integers  ≤ 106, it can be done in O(log(n) + log(s)) time by "Sieve of Eratosthenes".
Start from second stage, when second beacon is moving:
Position of beacons will look like pair of points: (0, 0), (0, k), where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
We need to check existing of point (x, y) such, that area of triangle (0, 0), (0, k), (x, y) equals to s. Using cross product |((0, k) - (0, 0))·((x, y) - (0, 0))| = 2·s. After simplifying we get |k·x| = 2·s where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
So we can iterate all divisors of 2·s, using factorization of s and recursive algorithm.
Complexity of second stage is O(σ (s)), where σ (s) — number of divisors of s and for s ≤ 1018 σ (s) ≤  ≈ 105.
In the first stage we have such points: (k, 0), (0, n), where 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
We need to check existing of point (x, y) such, that area of triangle (k, 0), (0, n), (x, y) equals to s. Using cross product |((k, 0) - (0, n))·((x, y) - (0, n))| = 2·s we can get next equation: |k·(y - n) + n·x| = 2·s. Then solution exists iff gcd(k, n) | 2·s (2s % gcd(k, n) = 0).
And we need to calculate how many 1 ≤ k ≤ m such, that gcd(k, n) | 2·s.
We will solve it in next way: let's n = p1n1p2n2... plnl and 2s = p1s1p2s2... plsl (ni, si ≥ 0).
Look at all pi, that ni > si. It's obvious, that if pisi + 1 is divisor of k, then 2s doesn't divide at gcd(k, n).
In result, we have some constrains on k, like k doesn't divide at aj = pijsij + 1.
Finally, we have next task: calculate number of k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) such, that k doesn't divide any of ai. It can be done with inclusion-exclusion principle, where number of k which divides ai1, ai2 ... aib is $$\frac{n}{a_{i_1}a_{i_2}\ldots a_{i_b}}$$.
Complexity of first stage is O(2z(n)), where z(x) — number of prime divisors of x, z ≤ 15 for integers up to 1018.
Result complexity is O(σ (s) + 2z(n)) per test.</span></div></div>

Moreover, Mister B learned that the star shines once in exactly T seconds. The problem is that the star is yet to be discovered by scientists.

There are n astronomers numerated from 1 to n trying to detect the star. They try to detect the star by sending requests to record the sky for 1 second.

The astronomers send requests in cycle: the i-th astronomer sends a request exactly ai second after the (i - 1)-th (i.e. if the previous request was sent at moment t, then the next request is sent at moment t + ai); the 1-st astronomer sends requests a1 seconds later than the n-th. The first astronomer sends his first request at moment 0.

Mister B doesn't know the first moment the star is going to shine, but it's obvious that all moments at which the star will shine are determined by the time of its shine moment in the interval [0, T). Moreover, this interval can be split into T parts of 1 second length each of form [t, t + 1), where t = 0, 1, 2, ..., (T - 1).

Mister B wants to know how lucky each astronomer can be in discovering the star first.

For each astronomer compute how many segments of form [t, t + 1) (t = 0, 1, 2, ..., (T - 1)) there are in the interval [0, T) so that this astronomer is the first to discover the star if the first shine of the star happens in this time interval.</span></div></div>

Let's denote $$s = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$$. We can see, that, at first, all operation with time are modulo T and the i - th astronomer checks moments sti, (sti + s)%T, (sti + 2s)%T ..., where $$st_i = \sum_{j=2}^{i} a_j$$. More over, every astronomer, who checks moment t will check moment (t + S)%T by next time.
So we now constructed functional graph with T vertices. But this graph has very special type, since it can be divided on some cycles. More specifically, This graph consists of gcd(T, s) oriented cycles and each cycle has length exactly $$\frac{T}{gcd(T,s)}$$. Even more, vertices u and v belong to same cycle iff u ≡ v (mod gcd(T, s)).
So we can work with cycles independently.
Let's look closely on one cycle. It's obviously, that all astronomers will walk on their cycles from their starting positions sti % T. But what the answer for them.
Answer for the i - th astronomer is number of vertices, including starting vertex, to the nearest starting vertex of any other astronomer if count along the orientation of cycle, because if two astronomers came to same vertex, lucky is one, who came first. Other astronomer has this vertex as start, his time is stj, i - th time is sti + k·s, k ≥ 1 and sti + k·s > stj. If sti ≡  stj (mod T) and sti &lt; stj then answer for the j - th astronomer is always 0.
So we must effectively calculate distance between two positions on cycle.
For that, let's numerate vertices along the orientation of cycle using vertex with minimal label as 0. If we will know position of sti% T for every astronomer calculation of distance between consecutive is trivial (sort, or set or other).
For the i - th astronomer let's denote vertex with label 0 in his cycle as zi. zi = sti % gcd(T, s). But cycles very specific, because vertex with label 0 is zi, vertex with label 1 is (zi + s) % T, vertex with label 2 is (zi + 2s) % T. In other words, vertex with label k is (zi + k·s) % T.
If we want to know position k of sti, we need to find v such, that v ≡  (v% gcd(T, s)) + k·s(mod T) which is diofant equation and can be calculated in O(log(T)) time.
Result complexity is O(n·log(T)).</span></div></div>

For n  =  4 it's easy to construct such a solution. Then let's add two vertices at a time: a  =  n  -  1 and b  =  n.

It equals the number of non-zero digits in $$$n$$$. Why? Because we can "remove" exactly one non-zero digit in $$$n$$$ using exactly one round number (so we need at most this amount of round numbers) and, on the other hand, the sum of two round numbers has at most two non-zero digits (the sum of three round numbers has at most three non-zero digits and so on) so this is useless to try to remove more than one digit using the sum of several round numbers.
So we need to find all digits of $$$n$$$ and print the required number for each of these digits. For example, if $$$n=103$$$ then $$$n=1 \cdot 10^2 + 0 \cdot 10^1 + 3 \cdot 10^0$$$, so we need two round numbers: $$$1 \cdot 10^2$$$ and $$$3 \cdot 10^0$$$.
Because the last digit of $$$n$$$ is $$$n \% 10$$$ (the remainder of $$$n$$$ modulo $$$10$$$) and we can remove the last digit of the number by integer division on $$$10$$$, we can use the following code to solve the problem:</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">There are $$$n$$$ candies in a row, they are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The size of the $$$i$$$-th candy is $$$a_i$$$.

Alice and Bob play an interesting and tasty game: they eat candy. Alice will eat candy from left to right, and Bob — from right to left. The game ends if all the candies are eaten.

The process consists of moves. During a move, the player eats one or more sweets from her/his side (Alice eats from the left, Bob — from the right).

Alice makes the first move. During the first move, she will eat $$$1$$$ candy (its size is $$$a_1$$$). Then, each successive move the players alternate — that is, Bob makes the second move, then Alice, then again Bob and so on.

On each move, a player counts the total size of candies eaten during the current move. Once this number becomes strictly greater than the total size of candies eaten by the other player on their previous move, the current player stops eating and the move ends. In other words, on a move, a player eats the smallest possible number of candies such that the sum of the sizes of candies eaten on this move is strictly greater than the sum of the sizes of candies that the other player ate on the previous move. If there are not enough candies to make a move this way, then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends.

For example, if $$$n=11$$$ and $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$$$, then:

- move 1: Alice eats one candy of size $$$3$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$$$.
- move 2: Alice ate $$$3$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$4$$$ or more. Bob eats one candy of size $$$5$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3]$$$.
- move 3: Bob ate $$$5$$$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $$$6$$$ or more. Alice eats three candies with the total size of $$$1+4+1=6$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[5,9,2,6,5,3]$$$.
- move 4: Alice ate $$$6$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$7$$$ or more. Bob eats two candies with the total size of $$$3+5=8$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[5,9,2,6]$$$.
- move 5: Bob ate $$$8$$$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $$$9$$$ or more. Alice eats two candies with the total size of $$$5+9=14$$$ and the sequence of candies becomes $$$[2,6]$$$.
- move 6 (the last): Alice ate $$$14$$$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $$$15$$$ or more. It is impossible, so Bob eats the two remaining candies and the game ends.

Print the number of moves in the game and two numbers:

- $$$a$$$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Alice during the game;
- $$$b$$$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Bob during the game.</span></div></div>

I'll describe $$$O(n)$$$ solution anyway.
Firstly, we need to maintain several variables: $$$cnt$$$ (initially $$$0$$$, the number of moves passed), $$$l$$$ (the position of the leftmost remaining candy, initially $$$0$$$), $$$r$$$ (the position of the rightmost remaining candy, initially $$$n-1$$$), $$$ansl$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Alice, initially $$$0$$$), $$$ansr$$$ (the sum of candied eaten by Bob, initially $$$0$$$), $$$suml$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Alice during her last move, initially $$$0$$$) and $$$sumr$$$ (the sum of candies eaten by Bob during his last move, initially $$$0$$$).
So, let's just simulate the following process while $$$l \le r$$$: if the number of moves $$$cnt$$$ is even then now is Alice's move and we need to maintain one more variable $$$nsuml = 0$$$ — the sum of candies Alice eats during this move. How to calculate it? While $$$l \le r$$$ and $$$nsuml \le sumr$$$, let's eat the leftmost candy, so variables will change like this: $$$nsuml := nsuml + a_l, l := l + 1$$$. After all, let's add $$$nsuml$$$ to $$$ansl$$$, replace $$$suml$$$ with $$$nsuml$$$ (assign $$$suml := nsuml$$$) and increase $$$cnt$$$ by $$$1$$$. If the number of moves $$$cnt$$$ is odd then the process is the same but from the Bob's side.
I'll also add a simply implemented $$$O(n^2)$$$ solution written by Gassa below :)</span></div></div>

You have $$$n$$$ tickets to sell. The price of the $$$i$$$-th ticket is $$$p_i$$$. As a teller, you have a possibility to select the order in which the tickets will be sold (i.e. a permutation of the tickets). You know that the cinema participates in two ecological restoration programs applying them to the order you chose:

- The $$$x\%$$$ of the price of each the $$$a$$$-th sold ticket ($$$a$$$-th, $$$2a$$$-th, $$$3a$$$-th and so on) in the order you chose is aimed for research and spreading of renewable energy sources.
- The $$$y\%$$$ of the price of each the $$$b$$$-th sold ticket ($$$b$$$-th, $$$2b$$$-th, $$$3b$$$-th and so on) in the order you chose is aimed for pollution abatement.

If the ticket is in both programs then the $$$(x + y) \%$$$ are used for environmental activities. Also, it's known that all prices are multiples of $$$100$$$, so there is no need in any rounding.

For example, if you'd like to sell tickets with prices $$$[400, 100, 300, 200]$$$ and the cinema pays $$$10\%$$$ of each $$$2$$$-nd sold ticket and $$$20\%$$$ of each $$$3$$$-rd sold ticket, then arranging them in order $$$[100, 200, 300, 400]$$$ will lead to contribution equal to $$$100 \cdot 0 + 200 \cdot 0.1 + 300 \cdot 0.2 + 400 \cdot 0.1 = 120$$$. But arranging them in order $$$[100, 300, 400, 200]$$$ will lead to $$$100 \cdot 0 + 300 \cdot 0.1 + 400 \cdot 0.2 + 200 \cdot 0.1 = 130$$$.

Nature can't wait, so you decided to change the order of tickets in such a way, so that the total contribution to programs will reach at least $$$k$$$ in minimum number of sold tickets. Or say that it's impossible to do so. In other words, find the minimum number of tickets which are needed to be sold in order to earn at least $$$k$$$.</span></div></div>

Let's define $$$cont(len)$$$ as the maximum contribution we can get selling exactly $$$len$$$ tickets.
Note, in general case sold ticket can be one of $$$4$$$ types:
• tickets with $$$(x + y)\%$$$ of the price are contributed; the number of such tickets is $$$cXY$$$;
• tickets with $$$x\%$$$ of the price are contributed; the number of such tickets is $$$cX$$$;
• tickets with $$$y\%$$$ of the price are contributed; the number of such tickets is $$$cY$$$;
• tickets which are not in both programs.
All values $$$cXY$$$, $$$cX$$$, $$$cY$$$ can be easily counted by iterating over indices $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$len$$$ and checking whenever $$$i$$$ is divisible by $$$a$$$ or by $$$b$$$ or both.
Now we can understand that it's always optimal to choose in the first group $$$cXY$$$ maximums from $$$p$$$, in the second group next $$$cX$$$ maximums and in the third — next $$$cY$$$ maximums.
Using the algorithm above we can calculate $$$cont(len)$$$ in linear time (just sort $$$p$$$ beforehand).
The final step is to understand that function $$$cont(len)$$$ is non decreasing, so we can just binary search the minimal $$$len$$$ with $$$cont(len) \ge k$$$.
The time complexity is $$$O(n \log{n})$$$, but $$$O(n \log^2{n})$$$ can pass too.</span></div></div>

For example, if $$$a = [2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2]$$$, you can get the following sequences in one operation (for convenience, denote elements equal to $$$x$$$ as $$$x$$$-elements):

Sequence $$$m$$$ contains integers which were used in some operation in the optimal answer. Sequence $$$d$$$ contains integers which were not used.
For example, if $$$a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, then optimal answer is move all $$$1$$$-elements to the beginning and then move all $$$5$$$-elements to the end, so $$$m = [1, 5]$$$ and $$$d = [2, 3, 4]$$$.
Two important conditions are held for these sequences:
1. $$$maxInd(d_{i-1}) &lt; minInd(d_i)$$$ for every $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$l$$$. $$$minInd(x)$$$ is the minimum index $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = x$$$, and $$$maxInd(x)$$$ is the maximum index $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = x$$$;
2. for each $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$l$$$ there is no such integer $$$x$$$, that $$$d_i &lt; x &lt; d_{i + 1}$$$ and sequence $$$m$$$ contains this integer $$$x$$$.
Since the answer is equal to $$$|m| = k$$$, we want to minimize this value. So we want to maximize the length of sequence $$$d$$$.
For each integer $$$l$$$ we want to find the maximum integer $$$dp_l = len$$$ such that we can sort sequence $$$a$$$ without moving elements in range $$$l \dots l + len - 1$$$. We can do it with dynamic programming.
Let's consider all integers occurring in sequence $$$a$$$ in descending order $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_t$$$ ($$$s_{i - 1} > s_{i}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$t$$$). If $$$maxInd(s_i) &lt; minInd(s_{i+1})$$$ then $$$dp_i = dp_{i + 1} + 1$$$, otherwise $$$dp_i = 1$$$.
The answer is equal to $$$t - \max\limits_{i=1 \dots t} dp_i$$$, there $$$t$$$ is the number of distinct integers in sequence $$$a$$$.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $$$s$$$ of the length $$$l$$$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $$$s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$$$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack.

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $$$s$$$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:

- $$$[1, 1]$$$;
- $$$[2, 1, 1, 2]$$$;
- $$$[1, 1, 2, 2]$$$;
- $$$[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$$$;
- $$$[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$$$;
- $$$[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$;
- $$$[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$$$;

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $$$s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$$$ (the top of stack is highlighted).

1. after pushing $$$s_1 = 5$$$ the stack turn into $$$[\textbf{5}]$$$;
2. after pushing $$$s_2 = 1$$$ the stack turn into $$$[5, \textbf{1}]$$$;
3. after pushing $$$s_3 = 2$$$ the stack turn into $$$[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$$$;
4. after pushing $$$s_4 = 2$$$ the stack turn into $$$[5, \textbf{1}]$$$;
5. after pushing $$$s_5 = 1$$$ the stack turn into $$$[\textbf{5}]$$$;
6. after pushing $$$s_6 = 4$$$ the stack turn into $$$[5, \textbf{4}]$$$;
7. after pushing $$$s_7 = 4$$$ the stack turn into $$$[\textbf{5}]$$$;
8. after pushing $$$s_8 = 5$$$ the stack is empty.

You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.</span></div></div>

If there is no such index, then $$$nxt_l = -1$$$.
If we calculate this array then we solve this task by simple dynamic programming.
Let's calculate it in order $$$nxt_n, nxt_{n-1}, \dots , nxt_1$$$ by dynamic programming. At first consider simple case. If $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$, then $$$nxt_i = i + 1$$$. Otherwise we have to "add" the block $$$a_{i+1} \dots a_{nxt_{i+1}}$$$ (of course, $$$nxt_{i + 1}$$$ should be not equal to $$$-1$$$) and check that $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{i + 1}}$$$. If this ($$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{i + 1}}$$$) also is not true, then you have to add a new block $$$a_{1 + nxt_{i+1}} \dots a_{nxt_{1 + nxt_{i+1}}}$$$ and check the condition $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{1 + nxt_{i+1}}}$$$. If this condition also is not try, then you have to add a new block and so on.
It is correct solution, but it can be too slowly. Let's understand, that we add blocks to $$$a_i$$$ until condition $$$a_i = a_{1 + nxt_{\dots}}$$$ is holds. Let's assume, that we have an array $$$nxtX$$$ (this array contains a hashMaps, for example you can use map in C++), such that $$$nxtX_{i, x}$$$ is is equal to the minimum index $$$r > l$$$ such that subarray $$$a_{l \dots r}$$$ is stack exterminable and $$$x = a_{r + 1}$$$. Then we can easily calculate the value $$$nxt_i = nxtX_{i+1, a_i} + 1$$$. Remains to understand, how to calculate $$$nxtX_{i}$$$. For this we just can make an assignment $$$nxtX_{i} = nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$. And then update $$$nxtX_{i, a_{nxt_i + 1}} = nxt_{i} + 1$$$.
But I deceived you a little. We can't make an assignment $$$nxtX_{i} = nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$ because it is to slow. Instead that you need to swap elements $$$nxtX_{i}$$$ and $$$nxtX_{nxt_i + 1}$$$, this can be done using the function $$$swap$$$ in C++ or Java (time complexity of $$$swap$$$ if $$$O(1)$$$).</span></div></div>

How to do so? At first, we can quite easily calculate the total number of logs of length $$$y$$$ we can acquire (denote it as $$$cntY$$$): since all $$$a_i \in [ky, ky + y)$$$ give the same number of logs which is equal to $$$k$$$, then let's just count the number of $$$a_i$$$ in $$$[ky, ky + y)$$$ for each $$$k$$$. We can do so using frequency array and prefix sums on it.
There are two cases in the problem: both logs of length $$$x$$$ lies in the same log $$$a_i$$$ or from the different logs $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. In the first case it's the same as finding one log of length $$$2x$$$. But in both cases we will divide all possible values of $$$x$$$ ($$$2x$$$) in segments $$$[ky, ky + y)$$$ and check each segment in $$$O(1)$$$ time.
Let's suppose that $$$2x \in [ky, ky + y)$$$ and there is $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$a_i \ge 2x$$$ and $$$(a_i \mod y) \ge (2x \mod y)$$$. In that case it's optimal to cut $$$2x$$$ from $$$a_i$$$ and, moreover, it's optimal to increase $$$2x$$$ while we can. It leads us straight to the solution, let's keep $$$\max(a_i \mod y)$$$ over $$$a_i \ge ky$$$ and check only $$$2x = ky + \max(a_i \mod y)$$$ (maybe minus one in case of wrong parity). We can maintain this max iterating $$$k$$$ in descending order. And since $$$\max(a_i \mod y)$$$ for all $$$a_i \in [ky, ky + y)$$$ is just a $$$\max(a_i~|~a_i &lt; ky + y)$$$. We can find such $$$a_i$$$ in $$$O(1)$$$ using precalc. To check the chosen $$$2x$$$ is trivial: the number of remaining logs $$$y$$$ is equal to $$$cntY - k$$$ and the plot will have the area $$$y \cdot \min(x, cntY - k)$$$.
The case with cutting $$$x$$$-s from different $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is based on the same idea, but we need to maintain two maximums $$$mx1$$$ and $$$mx2$$$ ($$$mx1 \ge mx2$$$). But in this case $$$x$$$ can be equal to both $$$mx1$$$ or $$$mx2$$$.
If $$$x = ky + mx2$$$ then everything is trivial: the number of logs $$$y$$$ is $$$cntY - 2 \cdot k$$$ and so on. If $$$x = ky + mx1$$$ then we need to additional check the existence of $$$a_i \ge x$$$ and $$$a_j \ge x$$$. Remaining number of logs $$$y$$$ will be equal to $$$cntY - 2 \cdot k - 1$$$ and so on.
In result, for each $$$y$$$ we can calculate the answer in $$$O(\frac{A}{y})$$$, so the total time complexity is $$$O(n + \sum_{y = 2}^{A}{O(\frac{A}{y})}) = O(n + A \log A)$$$.
P.S.: We decided to allow the $$$O(A \log^2 A)$$$ solution which binary search $$$x$$$ for each $$$y$$$ to pass if it's carefully written.</span></div></div>

In addition, for each type we know the price of one roll of this type.

The wallpaper of each type contains strips running along the length of the roll. When gluing the strips must be located strictly vertically (so the roll cannot be rotated, even if the length is less than the width). Besides, a roll can be cut in an arbitrary manner, but the joints of glued pieces should also be vertical. In addition, each room should be papered by only one type of wallpaper. And pieces of the same roll cannot be used to paper different rooms. That is, for each room the rolls are purchased separately. Also, some rolls can be used not completely.

Overall there were n people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms.

Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k.

Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.

1. Move the pj-th point from position xpj to position xpj + dj. At that, it is guaranteed that after executing such query all coordinates of the points will be distinct.
2. Count the sum of distances between all pairs of points that lie on the segment [lj, rj] (lj ≤ rj). In other words, you should count the sum of: $$\sum_{l_j \leq x_p \leq x_q \leq r_j} (x_q - x_p)$$.

Help Yaroslav.</span></div></div>

Kristina has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ positive integers. She wants to count the GCD of each neighbouring pair of numbers to get a new array $$$b$$$, called GCD-sequence.

So, the elements of the GCD-sequence $$$b$$$ will be calculated using the formula $$$b_i = GCD(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$.

Determine whether it is possible to remove exactly one number from the array $$$a$$$ so that the GCD sequence $$$b$$$ is non-decreasing (i.e., $$$b_i \le b_{i+1}$$$ is always true).

For example, let Khristina had an array $$$a$$$ = [$$$20, 6, 12, 3, 48, 36$$$]. If she removes $$$a_4 = 3$$$ from it and counts the GCD-sequence of $$$b$$$, she gets:

- $$$b_1 = GCD(20, 6) = 2$$$

Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size $$$n \times m$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 10^9$$$), the rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is denoted as ($$$r, c$$$).

Bob has $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:

- To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.
- Alice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.
- Alice will own the part that includes the cell ($$$n, 1$$$).
- Bob will own the part that includes the cell ($$$1, m$$$).

Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.

There are three possible positions of the fountains relative to the boundary with Alice's plot:

The area of Alice's plot changes only when removing the third type of fountain position, which we will call the corner.

Let's use the solution of the easy version to precalculate the stored information on the prefix.
The fountain will stop being a corner only when it is removed, because the leftmost corner on the prefix could not become further left as a result of removal.
To calculate the change in area, let's make an important observation: if fountain $$$j$$$ is not a corner, then it either cannot become one, or will become one only after the removal of the last corner that comes before it in sorted order. It was the leftmost corner that came before fountain $$$j$$$, and the next corner in sorted order will be strictly higher.
Thus, we need to do the following: for each corner, calculate the area without considering it until the next corner, and this will be helped by the precalculation we did when calculating the area. Each fountain will be processed only once, so the time complexity is $$$O(n)$$$.</span></div></div>

Next to the tree, the girl found an ancient manuscript with $$$m$$$ queries written on it. The queries can be of two types.

The first type of query is described by the integer $$$y$$$. The weight of each edge in the tree is replaced by the bitwise exclusive OR of the weight of that edge and the integer $$$y$$$.

The second type is described by the vertex $$$v$$$ and the integer $$$x$$$. Yasya chooses a vertex $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le u \le n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) and mentally draws a bidirectional edge of weight $$$x$$$ from $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$ in the tree.

Then Yasya finds a simple cycle in the resulting graph and calculates the bitwise exclusive OR of all the edges in it. She wants to choose a vertex $$$u$$$ such that the calculated value is maximum. This calculated value will be the answer to the query. It can be shown that such a cycle exists and is unique under the given constraints (independent of the choice of $$$u$$$). If an edge between $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ already existed, a simple cycle is the path $$$v \to u \to v$$$.

Note that the second type of query is performed mentally, meaning the tree does not change in any way after it.

Help Yasya answer all the queries.</span></div></div>

This can be done by depth-first traversal in $$$O(n)$$$.
Now let's learn how to solve the problem in $$$O(n)$$$ for each query. The first type of query can be executed straightforwardly. Notice that due to the properties of the xor operation, the values will only change for vertices at odd depth (the depth of the root is $$$0$$$). At the same time, they will change trivially: they will be xored with $$$y$$$. To answer the second query, it is necessary to realize that the xor on a simple cycle $$$v \to \text{lca}(v, u) \to u \to v$$$ is equal to $$$d_v \oplus d_u \oplus x$$$. Indeed, the path from $$$\text{lca(v, u)}$$$ to the root will be counted twice, so it will turn into $$$0$$$, and no other extra edges will be included in this xor. With due skill, you can try to speed up such a solution with AVX instructions, but the time constraints were chosen strictly.
For a complete solution to the problem, you can use the data structure prefix tree (trie). With its help, you can find in $$$O(\log x)$$$ for the number $$$x$$$ such a $$$y$$$ in the set, that $$$x \oplus y$$$ is maximal. Since $$$d_v$$$ change differently, you will have to use two tries — for vertices at even and odd heights. Operations of the first type can be accumulated in the variable $$$w_\text{odd}$$$ and added to the xor expression. In addition, you must not forget to remove $$$d_v$$$ from the necessary trie when answering the second query, and then insert it back. To do this, you can maintain a counter of terminal leaves in each vertex and use this information during descent.
Thus, the final asymptotic is $$$O((n + m) \log 10^9)$$$.</span></div></div>

A particle can pass through a plane directly, however, every plane produces an identical copy of the particle going in the opposite direction with a decay age $$$k-1$$$. If a particle has decay age equal to $$$1$$$, it will NOT produce a copy.

For example, if there are two planes and a particle is shot with decay age $$$3$$$ (towards the right), the process is as follows: (here, $$$D(x)$$$ refers to a single particle with decay age $$$x$$$)

1. the first plane produces a $$$D(2)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(3)$$$ continue on to the right;
2. the second plane produces a $$$D(2)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(3)$$$ continue on to the right;
3. the first plane lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the left and produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the right;
4. the second plane lets $$$D(1)$$$ continue on to the right ($$$D(1)$$$ cannot produce any copies).

In total, the final multiset $$$S$$$ of particles is $$$\{D(3), D(2), D(2), D(1)\}$$$. (See notes for visual explanation of this test case.)

Gaurang is unable to cope up with the complexity of this situation when the number of planes is too large. Help Gaurang find the size of the multiset $$$S$$$, given $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.

Since the size of the multiset can be very large, you have to output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note: Particles can go back and forth between the planes without colliding with each other.</span></div></div>

Test case 1: ($$$n = 2$$$, $$$k = 3$$$) is already explained in the problem statement.

See the below figure of this simulation. Each straight line with a different color represents the path of a different particle. As you can see, there are four distinct particles in the multiset. Note that the vertical spacing between reflected particles is for visual clarity only (as mentioned before, no two distinct particles collide with each other)

Test case 2: ($$$n = 2$$$, $$$k = 2$$$) is explained as follows:

1. the first plane produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the right;
2. the second plane produces a $$$D(1)$$$ to the left and lets $$$D(2)$$$ continue on to the right;
3. the first plane lets $$$D(1)$$$ continue on to the left ($$$D(1)$$$ cannot produce any copies).

Total size of multiset obtained $$$\{D(1), D(1), D(2)\}$$$ is equal to three.

Test case 3: ($$$n = 3$$$, $$$k = 1$$$), there are three planes, but decay age is only one. So no new copies are produced while the one particle passes through the planes. Hence, the answer is one.

Test case 4: ($$$n = 1$$$, $$$k = 3$$$) there is only one plane. The particle produces a new copy to the left. The multiset $$$\{D(2), D(3)\}$$$ is of size two.</span></div></div>

There is a city in which Dixit lives. In the city, there are $$$n$$$ houses. There is  exactly one directed road between every pair of houses. For example, consider two houses A and B, then there is a directed road either from A to B or from B to A but not both. The number of roads leading to the $$$i$$$-th house is $$$k_i$$$.

Two houses A and B are bi-reachable if A is reachable from B and B is reachable from A. We say that house B is reachable from house A when there is a path from house A to house B.

Dixit wants to buy two houses in the city, that is, one for living and one for studying. Of course, he would like to travel from one house to another. So, he wants to find a pair of bi-reachable houses A and B. Among all such pairs, he wants to choose one with the maximum value of $$$|k_A - k_B|$$$, where $$$k_i$$$ is the number of roads leading to the house $$$i$$$. If more than one optimal pair exists, any of them is suitable.

Since Dixit is busy preparing CodeCraft, can you help him find the desired pair of houses, or tell him that no such houses exist?

In the problem input, you are not given the direction of each road. You are given — for each house — only the number of incoming roads to that house ($$$k_i$$$).

You are allowed to ask only one type of query from the judge: give two houses A and B, and the judge answers whether B is reachable from A. There is no upper limit on the number of queries. But, you cannot ask more queries after the judge answers "Yes" to any of your queries. Also, you cannot ask the same query twice.

Once you have exhausted all your queries (or the judge responds "Yes" to any of your queries), your program must output its guess for the two houses and quit.

Before beginning the game, a special integer $$$k$$$ is chosen. The game proceeds as follows:

- Alice begins the game, with moves alternating each turn;
- in any move, the current player may choose some node (for example, $$$i$$$) which has depth at least $$$k$$$. Then, the player picks some positive number of presents hanging from that node, let's call it $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \le m \le a_i)$$$;

Therefore, the only possible values of the triplets $$$(x,y,z)$$$ are of the form $$$(t,t+1,t+2)$$$ for positive integers $$$1 \le t \le n-2$$$, and we can iterate through all such triplets and find the best one.

The floors are numbered from top to bottom in increasing order. In the pyramid, the $$$i$$$-th floor consists of $$$i$$$ rooms.

Denote the $$$j$$$-th room on the $$$i$$$-th floor as $$$(i,j)$$$. For all positive integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \le j \le i &lt; n$$$, there are $$$2$$$ one-way staircases which lead from $$$(i,j)$$$ to $$$(i+1,j)$$$ and from $$$(i,j)$$$ to $$$(i+1,j+1)$$$ respectively.

In each room you can either put a torch or leave it empty. Define the brightness of a room $$$(i, j)$$$ to be the number of rooms with a torch from which you can reach the room $$$(i, j)$$$ through a non-negative number of staircases.

For example, when $$$n=5$$$ and torches are placed in the rooms $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(2,1)$$$, $$$(3,2)$$$, $$$(4,1)$$$, $$$(4,3)$$$, and $$$(5,3)$$$, the pyramid can be illustrated as follows:

In the above picture, rooms with torches are colored in yellow, and empty rooms are white. The blue numbers in the bottom-right corner indicate the brightness of the rooms.

The room $$$(4,2)$$$ (the room with a star) has brightness $$$3$$$. In the picture below, the rooms from where you can reach $$$(4,2)$$$ have red border. The brightness is $$$3$$$ since there are three torches among these rooms.

The pyramid is called nice if and only if for all floors, all rooms in the floor have the same brightness.

Define the brilliance of a nice pyramid to be the sum of brightness over the rooms $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(2,1)$$$, $$$(3,1)$$$, ..., $$$(n,1)$$$.

Find an arrangement of torches in the pyramid, such that the resulting pyramid is nice and its brilliance is maximized.

The configuration is as follows: Room $$$(i,j)$$$ contains a torch if and only if it is the leftmost room ($$$i=1$$$) or the rightmost room ($$$i=j$$$) on the $$$i$$$-th floor.
This is valid because for all rooms $$$(i,j)$$$, it can be reached from $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(2,1)$$$, $$$(3,1)$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$(i-j+1,1)$$$ and $$$(2,2)$$$, $$$(3,3)$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$(j,j)$$$.

Since removed elements stay removed, the above is only possible if all of $$$x,2x,\cdots (k-1)x$$$ does not belong to $$$T$$$.
For each $$$v$$$, let $$$f(v)$$$ be the smallest integer $$$x$$$ satisfying the above condition. As we can always remove $$$v$$$ using a $$$v$$$-cost operation, $$$f(v) \leq v$$$ and in particular $$$f(v)$$$ exists.
The total cost must be at least $$$\sum_{i \not \in T} f(i)$$$. We claim that this cost can be achieved.
To do so, we should remove the required elements in ascending order. When removing $$$v$$$, we assume all $$$w \not\in T$$$ with $$$w&lt;v$$$ have already been removed. At this state, an $$$f(v)$$$-cost operation would be able to remove $$$v$$$.
It remains to find the values $$$f(v)$$$. To do so efficiently, we can perform the above process in a bottom-up manner similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

		Dataset description
	</span>
</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a> is one of the most popular websites among competitive programmers, hosting regular contests where participants must solve challenging algorithmic optimization problems. The challenging nature of these problems makes them an interesting dataset to improve and test models’ code reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>While previous efforts such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests">DeepMind’s CodeContests dataset</a> have compiled a large amount of CodeForces problems, we have compiled more than <strong>10k unique problems</strong> covering the very first contests all the way to 2025, <strong>~3k</strong> of which were not included in DeepMind’s dataset. Additionally, for around 60% of problems, we have <strong>included the <em>editorial</em>,</strong>  which is an explanation, written by the contest organizers, explaining the correct solution. You will also find 3 correct solutions per problem extracted from the official website (soon).</p>
<p>You can load the dataset as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> datasets <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> load_dataset

ds = load_dataset(<span class="hljs-string">"open-r1/codeforces"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"train"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We are also releasing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hf.co/datasets/open-r1/codeforces-cots"><code>open-r1/codeforces-cots</code></a>, which contains chain of thought generations produced by DeepSeek-R1 on these problems, where we asked the model to produce solutions in C++ (the main language used in competitive programming) and Python, totaling close to <strong>100k</strong> samples.</p>
