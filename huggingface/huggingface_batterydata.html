Recently, the number of cases of contact allergic dermatitis among beauticians specialized in sculpting artificial nails has increased. Objective Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates in beauticians and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting artificial nails over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 beauticians and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32.2 years, and 26.7% had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients —2 beauticians and 1 client— presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7/15, 46.7%), 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%), and methyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%). Conclusions Acrylate monomers used for sculpting artificial nails are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ABSTRACT According to the Nernst–Planck equation, the transport of charged species in porous electrodes is mainly driven by diffusion and migration. Although a number of all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) models have been developed by several VRFB modeling groups, a comparative study of these two ion transport mechanisms has not been clearly reported in the literature. In this study, we develop a three-dimensional (3-D), transient VRFB model that rigorously accounts for both diffusion and migration mechanisms of charged species, including V2+, V3+, VO2+,VO2 + and H+. The VRFB model relies upon five principles of conservation: mass, momentum, species, electric charge, and thermal energy. Due to the general form of the conservation equations, both species migration effects on species transport and species diffusion effects on charge transport are considered in the source terms of the model equations. The model calculates species migration and diffusion fluxes through the membrane and compares their relative magnitudes under various charging and discharging stages. This paper clearly elucidates the role of species migration on vanadium crossover and the subsequent capacity losses, demonstrating that the present VRFB model is a valuable tool for optimizing the component design and operation of VRFBs.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Carbon-encapsulated nano-MnO composite with novel multiple structure loaded on N-doped carbon webs (CMNCWs) has been designed and fabricated by using polypyrrole webs as both template and precursor. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, CMNCWs exhibit a superhigh reversible capacity and excellent rate capability, delivering a capacity as high as 1268mAhg−1 after 700 cycles at a current density of 1.0Ag−1. Such superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique multiple structure, which cannot only effectively shorten the transport path of Li+ ions and enhance the conductivity, but also relieve the volume change and prevent agglomeration of Mn grains during the phase transformation in the conversion reaction.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Search for simple and economical electrocatalyst for the hydrogen gas evolution reaction (HER), which can resemble to the performance of Pt and other precious metals, is a challenging research interest. In this work, a systematic effect of pre-treatment potential of screen-printed carbon (SPCE) surface on the HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 was carried out. A new observation of a low potential HER (onset potential, E onset = −0.02 V vs. RHE) at a cathodic potential, −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl on 1 hr pre-treated screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE*, * = pre-treated) was observed. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations of the SPCE* by field emission scanning electron-microscope, Raman, IR and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopes reveals specific generation of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon surface and in turn for the enhanced HER on the modified electrode surface. Electrochemical characterization of SPCE* with Fe(CN)6 3− support the observation. A marked decrement in the peak current and significant increase in the peak-to-peak separation potential response due electrostatic repulsion between the anion sites of Fe(CN)6 3− and –COO– were noticed. This observation is in parallel with the reduced electrical double layer capacitance value of the SPCE* system. The E onset and Tafel value (54.7 mV dec−1) obtained here are comparable to those at Pt, MoS2, MoSe2 and superior over the N- and P-doped graphene/carbon electrocatalysts for HER. A prototype HER system was developed and demonstrated for H2 gas production at a rate of 0.0053 μM s−1 (Operating potential = −0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl), which is comparable to that of precious metal and metal compound electrocatalysts based HER performance.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The frequent occurrence of natural disasters is a major threat to the property and casualties of human beings in recent decades. Disaster prone points can be very closely monitored by augmenting the distribution of wireless sensor networks. However, replacing the battery of electronics regularly remains a significant challenge especially in a remote area. In this study, we report a wind-driven hybridized energy harvester which is designed for rotating energy harvesting and can be integrated with WSN technology to develop a self-powered natural disaster monitoring system. In this harvester, the rotator is directly driven by external rotational motion thus can easily hybridize the TENG with eighteen EMGs. Consequently, the fully packaged WH-EH device combining with the water-proof flexible solar cell can be completely isolated from the harsh wilderness environment. The output feature of TENG of high voltage but low current that perfectly compensate for the differing performance of EMG to achieve an excellent output power of the hybrid device with a broad frequency range. Moreover, the WH-EH is capable of lighting hundreds of LEDs and powering small electronics. The quick-acting charging ability of a capacitor by the WH-EH was conducted effectively in experimental tests. Finally, three self-powered sensor systems enabled by a single WH-EH were discussed and demonstrated, including a temperature sensor for forest fire detection, a vibration sensor for earthquake monitoring and a wireless transceiver for alarm information spreading. Obviously, the invention of the hybridized nanogenerator will be of great importance to promote the development of self-powered wireless sensor networks and provide a sustainable power-supply solution to long-term natural disaster monitoring stations in residential or remote areas.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Polymeric gel electrolytes (PGE), based on polyacrylonitrile blended with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-co-HFP)), which are reinforced with glass-fibre cloth (GFC) to increase the mechanical strength, are prepared for the practical use in lithium secondary batteries. The resulting electrolytes exhibit electrochemical stability at 4.5V against lithium metal and a conductivity value of (2.0–2.1)×10−3 Scm−1 at room temperature. The GFC–PGE electrolytes show excellent strength and flexibility when used in batteries even if they contain a plasticiser. A test cell with LiCoO2 as a positive electrode and mesophase pich-based carbon fibre (MCF) as a negative electrode display a capacity of 110mAhg−1 based on the positive electrode weight at the 0.2C rate at room temperature. Over 80% of the initial capacity is retained after 400 cycles.

The wires are prepared with a unique etching fabrication method, which allows to fabricate wires of very precise sizes. In order to investigate how good randomly oriented silicon wires perform in contrast to the perfect order of the array, the wires are embedded in a paste. This study reveals the fundamental correlation between geometry, mechanics and charge transfer kinetics of silicon electrodes. Using a suitable RC equivalent circuit allows to evaluate data from cyclic voltammetry and simultaneous FFT-Impedance Spectroscopy (FFT-IS), yielding in time-resolved resistances, time constants, and their direct correlation to the phase transformations. The change of the resistances during lithiation and delithiation correlates to kinetics and charge transfer mechanisms. This study demonstrates how the mechanical and physiochemical interactions at the silicon/paste interface inside the paste electrodes lead to void formation around silicon and with it to material loss and capacity fading.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Potassium-ion batteries attract tremendous attention for large scale application due to the abundance of K resources.

This hard carbon exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency (73%) and superior cycling stability and rate capability (253 mAh g−1 and 165 mAh g−1 at 40 mA g−1 and 4000 mA g−1, respectively) due to its unique porous architecture and large surface area.

However, offenders are not the only group with a high exposure to extrinsic morbidity-mortality. In the present study, we investigated the LH strategies employed by two groups of Polish men: incarcerated offenders (N = 84) as well as soldiers and firefighters (N = 117), whose professions involve an elevated risk of injury and premature death. The subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables. Although biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators should be closely linked with each other, the actual connection between them is unclear. Thus, this study was driven by two aims: comparing LH strategies in two groups of men with a high risk of premature morbidity-mortality and investigating the relationship between the biodemographic and psychosocial LH dimensions. The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators. The results strengthen the legitimacy of incorporating biodemographic LH traits into research models and indicate the need for further research on the accuracy of the Mini-K.

However, the development of anode materials is essential in order to achieve high power density as well as stable long-term cycle life of ASCs. In this study, functionalized graphene aerogel (GA) decorated with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles is used as an efficient ASC anode material.

ASCs assembled from manganese dioxide (cathode) and GA composite (anode) show stable extended cell voltage, fast charge–discharge capability, excellent cycle stability (89.6% retention after 3000 cycles), and high energy and power densities (average of 13.9Whkg−1 and 13.3kWkg−1).

High human Pb burdens are accompanied by elevated concentrations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in soils and house dust within the city, which has a long history of mining and metallurgy. In this study enrichment-levels for PHEs in soils are quantified and compared to environmental quality guidelines and a statistically-derived estimation of background concentration. In addition, Pb isotopes (207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) are used to characterise the isotopic signatures of potential point sources of Pb and a mixing model employed to quantify the contribution of sources to Pb present in soils, house dust, and the scalp hair of children and young people. Pb isotopic evidence suggests that Pb in surface soils and house-dust is predominantly sourced from historical deposition of Pb-containing aerosols from metal smelting, with lower contributions from wind-blown dispersal of metalliferous waste. Pb present in scalp hair is interpreted as the result of non-occupational exposure and the ingestion and/or inhalation of Pb-enriched surface soil and house dust.

In a sample of 379 adolescents (212 boys, 167 girls), resting RSA was assessed during a laboratory session, and adolescents reported on parental support, negative interaction with parents, empathic concern and externalizing behavior during a home visit. We found no support for high resting RSA predicting low externalizing behavior or high empathic concern. However, in line with our hypotheses, we did find several instances of RSA functioning as a moderator, although the interaction patterns varied. First, negative interaction with parents was a negative predictor of externalizing behavior for girls low in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls with high RSA. Second, higher negative interaction with parents predicted lower empathic concern for boys high in resting RSA, whereas the association was reversed for boys with low resting RSA. Third, parental support was a positive predictor of empathic concern for girls high in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls low in resting RSA. The findings suggest that adolescents with different levels of resting RSA respond differentially to relationship quality with parents.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This study investigated the effects of phonologic treatment for anomia in aphasia.

The aims of our study were: (a) to evaluate the effects of three solid industrial wastes (incineration ash, contaminated wood chips and contaminated soil) on three Oligochaeta species (enchytraeids Enchytraeus albidus, Enchytraeus crypticus and earthworm Eisenia fetida) in avoidance tests; (b) to compare the sensitivity among the species and to compare results of avoidance test to reproduction tests; (c) to elucidate if measuring the weight in the earthworm avoidance test could be reasonable additional endpoint. Avoidance mostly increased with the increasing percent of waste in the mixture showing a dose–response curve. E. fetida was the most sensitive species and E. crypticus the least one. An additional endpoint, (changes in weight after two-day exposure) was not found to be more sensitive than avoidance reaction, but it confirmed that earthworms staying in the highest concentrations of the waste mixture were affected showing apparent weight reduction.

Herein, we report a precious-metal-free and carbon-free O2 electrode synthesized via electrodeposition of manganese oxide (MnOx) on a stainless steel (SS) substrate followed by high-temperature calcination at 480 °C. The MnOx–SS electrode displays high oxygen reduction and water oxidation activities when tested in an electrochemical cell, comparable to that of a precious-metal based electrode, Pt/C–SS. Accelerated durability testing reveals the excellent stability of the MnOx–SS electrode compared to both the Pt/C–SS electrode and a carbon-based electrode with MnOx and Ni catalysts. This can be rationalized by the carbon-free nature of the MnOx–SS electrode which circumvents carbon corrosion at the high electrochemical potentials during water oxidation and O2 reduction. Integrating the MnOx–SS electrode as the O2 electrode into an anion exchange membrane (AEM) URFC produces round-trip efficiencies of 42–45% at 20 mA cm−2 over 10 cycles, and exhibits significantly enhanced durability compared to the carbon-based analogue. This work demonstrates the MnOx–SS electrode's potential for use as a high performance, scalable, precious-metal-free and carbon-free O2 electrode in AEM-URFCs and metal–air batteries.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Mental disorders (MD), such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, are highly prevalent in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

The electrosynthesized film (P(o-ASA)) was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance. The compensation of P(o-ASA) charge was evaluated using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance combined with cyclic voltammetry, which showed that the electroneutralization process mainly involves cations. Additionally, copolymers of aniline and o-ASA were electrosynthesized, using a metallic electrode modified with PANI also as a working electrode. The degree of sulfanation of copolymers has been modulated with the proportions of monomers in the electrosynthesis solution.

Healthy participants (n = 140) were randomly allocated to five combinations of training, including visual search training used as an active control training for the WMT; all five groups were compared to a sixth silent control group receiving no training. All groups were evaluated before and after training for resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral executive function measures. The participants in the silent control group were unaware of this procedure, and received one of the training protocols only after study has ended. Results demonstrated significant improvement in the practice tasks in all training groups including non-specific influence of NFT on resting-state EEG spectral topography. There was only a near transfer effect (improvement in working memory task) for WMT, which remained significant in the delayed post-test (after 1 month), in comparison to silent control group but not in comparison to active control training group. The NFT + WMT combined group showed improved mental rotation ability both in the post-training and in the follow-up evaluations. This improvement, however, did not differ significantly from that in the silent control group.

In this work, a more advanced mechanical constriction technique is applied on a solid-state battery constructed with Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) as the electrolyte and a lithium metal/graphite composite as the anode, where the graphite layer was applied to prevent (electro-)chemical reactions between Li metal and LGPS, as well as a short-circuit upon the application of pressure. The decomposition pathway of LGPS at the anode interface is modified by this mechanical constriction design, and the growth of lithium dendrites is inhibited, leading to excellent rate and cycling performances.

Depending on the intensity and time of milling alloys with different microstructure were obtained. The as-milled TiNi1−xMnx alloys contain substantial amount of amorphous phase, which crystallizes during annealing. Annealing of the as-milled fine nanocrystalline materials at 500 °C results only in slight coarsening of the microstructure, which remains still nanocrystalline. Fully crystalline material (with crystal size larger than 50 nm), consisting of mainly cubic TiNi was obtained by annealing the ball-milled alloys at T ≥ 700 °C. Electrochemical hydrogen charge/discharge cycling of the as-milled as well as of annealed alloys were carried out at galvanostatic conditions.

The subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables.

The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators.

High-temperature annealing enhanced the crystallinity of RF-sputtered cobalt oxide films due to rearrangement of cobalt and oxygen atoms. Electrochemical characterization of RF-sputtered films was carried out by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge tests in the voltage range of 0.3–3.0V. Cyclic voltammetry plots showed that the RF-sputtered Co3O4 thin films were electrochemically active.

The two cells have the same configuration consisting of a nanoporous gold (NPG) air electrode and a ceramic separator of fast sodium ion conductor, NASICON. Only the selection of catholyte, either alkyl carbonate-based nonaqueous solution of NaClO4 or aqueous solution of NaOH, is different. All performances are demonstrated to be better for the aqueous one. Lower overpotential of aqueous cell leads to better round-trip efficiency. A large resistance relevant to oxygen reduction reaction in the nonaqueous cell is relieved by changing the catholyte to the aqueous electrolyte, affording higher rate capability and power density. The aqueous electrolyte is also effective to remove the limitation of the discharge capacity defined by the volumetric amount of air electrode, as has been claimed in previous studies on aqueous Na-air cells. Furthermore, the aqueous cell is demonstrated to be robust and less sensitive and to atmosphere. The NPG electrode works reversibly in the half-cell reaction of the aqueous cell, while an electrodeposition of metallic Na on the anode during charging requires an improvement.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Solid-state batteries have recently attracted great interest as potentially safe and stable high-energy storage systems.

To elucidate this relationship, we conducted a multimodal fusion analysis on the functional network connectivity (FNC) and gray matter density from MRI data from 13 BD, 40 MDD, and 33 matched healthy controls (HC). A data-driven fusion method called mCCA+jICA was used to identify the co-altered FNC and gray matter components. Comparing to HC, BD exhibited reduced gray matter density in the parietal and occipital cortices, which correlated with attenuated functional connectivity within sensory and motor networks, as well as hyper-connectivity in regions that are putatively engaged in cognitive control. In addition, lower gray matter density was found in MDD in the amygdala and cerebellum.

A previous pilot study has shown that minocycline, a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline, is effective in treating for negative and/or cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Objectives The present study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of minocycline for the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Ninety-two patients with early stage schizophrenia treated with risperidone entered this 16-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive minocycline (200mg per day) or the placebo. The primary outcome was evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Secondary outcomes included the response rate of SANS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and cognitive tests. Results Subjects receiving minocycline had greater improvements on SANS total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores (P<0.001) when compared with those receiving the placebo. Rates of treatment response (43.6%) in the minocycline group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group (10.0%) after 16weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference between the seven cognitive domains (P>0.05), except for the attention domain (P=0.044). Conclusions The addition of minocycline to atypical antipsychotic drugs in early schizophrenia had significant efficacy on negative symptoms but had a slight effect on the attention domains of patients with schizophrenia. It may be considered as a new adjunct treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

With the right external stimulus, the need for human interaction, sensors, and batteries will be eliminated, and by using additive manufacturing, more complex devices and parts can be produced. With the current understanding of shape memory mechanisms and with improved design for additive manufacturing, reversibility in 4D printing has recently been proven to be feasible. Conventional one-way 4D printing requires human interaction in the programming (or shape-setting) phase, but reversible 4D printing, or two-way 4D printing, will fully eliminate the need for human interference, as the programming stage is replaced with another stimulus. This allows reversible 4D printed parts to be fully dependent on external stimuli; parts can also be potentially reused after every recovery, or even used in continuous cycles—an aspect that carries industrial appeal. This paper presents a review on the mechanisms of shape memory materials that have led to 4D printing, current findings regarding 4D printing in alloys and polymers, and their respective limitations. The reversibility of shape memory materials and their feasibility to be fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing are summarized and critically analyzed. For reversible 4D printing, the methods of 3D printing, mechanisms used for actuation, and strategies to achieve reversibility are also highlighted.

This strategy integrates the advantages of both interface particle doping and surface coating as the layered structure of LCO is stabilized by a binary hybrid surface treatment, and the modified layer promotes the surface Li+ diffusivity and protects the LCO cathode from steady corrosion induced by surface side reaction. On the basis of in-situ NMR characterizations, it is found that after the first electrochemical delithiation/lithiation the phase reversibly changes from O3–I-type in LCO@BT and back to O3–I-type LxCO@BT (0.98 ≤ x＜1) rather than to a two-phase domain of O3–I and O3-II phase in uncoated LxCO (x＜0.98).

Age estimates based on the intraallelic microsatellite variation indicate that the −13910*T allele, which is more tightly associated with lactase persistence, originated in Eurasia before the Neolithic and after the emergence of modern humans outside Africa. We detected significant departures from neutrality for the −13910*T variant in geographically and evolutionary distant populations from southern Europe (Portuguese and Italians) and Africa (Fulbe) by using a neutrality test based on the congruence between the frequency of the allele and the levels of intraallelic variability measured by the number of mutations in adjacent microsatellites. This result supports the role of selection in the evolution of lactase persistence, ruling out possible confounding effects from recombination suppression and population history. Reevaluation of the available evidence on variation of the −13910 and −22018 loci indicates that lactase persistence probably originated from different mutations in Europe and most of Africa, even if 13910*T is not the causal allele, suggesting that selective pressure could have promoted the convergent evolution of the trait. Our study shows that a limited number of microsatellite loci may provide sufficient resolution to reconstruct key aspects of the evolutionary history of lactase persistence, providing an alternative to approaches based on large numbers of SNPs.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:57,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Li2MnO3 coated LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode has been sucessfully synthesized through a PVP-chelation and syn-lithiation strategy.

The charge compensation in Li2−x TMSiO4 upon delithiation is found to be achieved first by a combined reversible TM and oxygen redox process, originating from the dynamic response of their electronic structures to the Li ions (or electrons) removal and the associated charge transfer from the O to Fe ions, and then by the irreversible formation of O vacancy (VO) that destroys the host stability of these materials.

The PSG apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) was evaluated according to standard criteria, and SleepCheck assessed the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) based on nasal cannula pressure fluctuations. Compared to the full-night PSG, SleepCheck systematically overscored respiratory events (the mean difference between SleepCheck RDI and PSG AHI was 27.4±13.3 events per hour). This overscoring was in part related to normal physiologic decreases in flow during rapid eye movement sleep or after an arousal.

In the present report, soft-X-ray XANES spectra of Li K-edge, P L2,3-edge, O K-edge and Fe L2,3-edge have been obtained for LiFePO4 in crystalline, disordered and amorphous forms and some possible “impurities”, including LiPO3, Li4P2O7, Li3PO4, Fe3(PO4)2, FePO4, and Fe2O3. The results indicate that each element from different pure reference compounds exhibits unique spectral features in terms of energy position, shape and intensity of the resonances in its XANES. In addition, inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) reveals the surface vs. bulk property of the specimens. Therefore, the spectral data provided here can be used as standards in the future for phase composition analysis.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:66,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In chemical regulation, e.g. the EU Water Framework Directive, REACH, or the Pesticide Directive, standardized ecotoxicological tests are applied to evaluate and rank the hazard of compounds and for deriving environmental quality standards (EQS). Standardized test methods prescribe fixed testing conditions e.g. specific temperature, pH, light intensity etc. However, environmental conditions under which the organisms live are rarely identical to the standard conditions. Thus, the ecotoxicity of compounds found in standard test is not only a function of the compounds inherent physico-chemical properties but is also affected by test conditions. It is therefore important to study the effect of changes in test conditions in order to get reliable input ecotoxicity data for assessing the potential risk posed by a compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the implications of changing test conditions on the toxicity of four sulfonylurea herbicides (SUs). The toxicity of the four SUs towards Lemna gibba was investigated at three pH levels (6, 7.5 and 9), at two temperatures (15 and 24 °C) and two light regimes (continuous and 12:12 h light:dark cycle) The EC50 increased twofold to tenfold for the four SUs when pH was increased from 6 to 9. Decreasing the temperature from 24 to 15 °C or introducing a dark:light cycle did not cause any trends in changes in toxicity. The results show that test conditions can have an effect on the toxicity and this should be considered when the standard test results are used for derivation of EQS.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:67,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The first part of this interview covers Frank Oppenheimer’s childhood, family background, and early education in New York City; his deep lifelong bond to his older brother Robert; his undergraduate years at Johns Hopkins University (1930–1933); his stays at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England, and at the University of Florence, Italy (1933–1935); his graduate studies at the California Institute of Technology (1935–1939); his postdoctoral assistantship at Stanford University (1939–1941); and the frequent summers he spent in New Mexico with his brother, family, and friends.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;We investigated the contribution of preschoolers’ executive function (EF) skills to the effectiveness of their spontaneous strategy production when learning.

Participants were asked to remember the locations of four toys representing one of two categories (animals or chairs) placed in a wooden box. Most participants spontaneously implemented a clustering strategy by removing and/or replacing the toys according to category membership.

After controlling for age and IQ, participants who performed better on EF tasks were more likely to benefit from having used the clustering strategy.

This paper found that the long-term potential of biofuels to contribute to GHG reduction goals will depend not only on the rates of technological development of the second generation biofuels but also on the development of other advanced vehicles. In the medium term, the potential contribution of biofuels to rural development and realising a recycle-based society could become significant depending on the progress of technology for both second generation biofuel production and the collection and transportation of their feedstocks. The potential contribution of biofuels to Japan’s energy security is constrained by the availability of imports and the potential of domestic production.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:70,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Detection of cognitive impairment in patients with brain metastases is important for both patient management and clinical trials.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a good candidate, shown to be sensitive in detecting mild cognitive impairment in the pre-dementia setting.

In many studies an inverse relationship has been observed, among both men and women, between 2D:4D ratio and measures of athletic ability. It has been further suggested that, in hunter-gatherer populations, 2D:4D ratio might also be negatively correlated with hunting ability, itself assumed to be contingent on athleticism. This hypothesis has been tested using endurance running performance among runners from a Western, educated, and industrialized population as a proximate measure of hunting ability. However, it has not previously been tested among actual hunter-gatherers using more ecologically valid measures of hunting ability and success. The current study addresses this question among Tanzanian Hadza hunter-gatherers. I employ a novel method of assessing hunting reputation that, unlike previous methods, allows granular distinctions to be made between hunters at all levels of perceived ability. I find no statistically significant relationship between digit ratio and either hunting reputation or two important hunting skills. I confirm that Hadza men have higher mean 2D:4D ratios than men in many Western populations. I discuss the notion that 2D:4D ratio may be the consequence of an allometric scaling relationship between relative and absolute finger lengths. Although it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from these results, the current study provides no support for the theorized relationship between 2D:4D ratio and hunting skill.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Physically-based Li-ion electrochemical cell models have been shown capable of predicting cell performance and degradation, but are computationally expensive for optimization-oriented design applications. Faster empirical models have been developed from experimental data, but are not generalizable to operating conditions outside of the range established by the calibration data. In this paper, a reduced-order capacity-loss model for graphite anodes is derived based upon the salient physical loss mechanisms to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model fidelity. This model captures the two primary degradation mechanisms that occur in the graphite anode of a typical lithium ion cell: a) capacity loss due to Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer growth, and b) capacity loss due to isolation of active material. The model is calibrated and validated for a commercial 2.3-Ah cell with a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cathode and graphite anode. One data set is used for calibration, another four experimental data sets are used for validation. The model matches experimental capacity degradation results within a 20% error. Moreover, the reported model is 2400× faster than currently existing more complex physically-based electrochemical models that are only slightly more accurate (in some cases).&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This work demonstrates a straightforward strategy to develop the copper-indium-sulfide (CIS) quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) consisting of ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolyte instead of any volatile solvent.

It exhibited long-term stability within 20% drops after 72 h-continuous photo-irradiation and subsequent storage for more than 1300 h in dark.

In this retrospective single-center study, all forensic autopsies between 2011 and 2017 were included. Injuries following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients treated with mCC or ACCD were investigated and statistically compared using a bivariate logistic regression. In the seven-year period with 4433 autopsies, 614 were analyzed following CPR (mCC vs. ACCD: n = 501 vs. n = 113). The presence of any type of trunk injury was correlated with longer resuscitation intervals (30 ± 15 vs. 44 ± 25 min, p < 0.05). In comparison with mCC, treatment with ACCD led to more frequent skin emphysema (5 vs 0%, p = 0.012), pneumothorax (6 vs. 1%, p = 0.008), lung lesions (19 vs. 4%, p = 0.008), hemopericardium (3 vs 1%, p = 0.025) and liver lesions (10 vs. 1%, p = 0.001), all irrespective of confounding aspects. Higher age and longer CPR durations statistically influenced frequency of sternal and rib fractures (p < 0.001). The mean number of fractured ribs did not vary significantly between the groups (6 ± 3 vs. 7 ± 2, p = 0.09). In this cohort with unsuccessful CPR, chest compression-related injuries were more frequent following ACCD application than in the mCC group, but with only minutely increased odds ratios. The severity of injuries did not differ between the groups, and no iatrogenic injury was declared by the forensic pathologist as being fatal.

A simple solvothermal method has been described in this article to synthesize carbon coated LFP (LFP/C) nanoplates with varying thickness from 20 to 500 nm by using different iron precursors. The influence of solvents on the morphology of the LFP in the solvothermal synthesis is also investigated. A uniform carbon coverage at the surfaces has been achieved by a selective chelating carbonising source, D-gluconic acid lactone. The smallest dimension of the nanoplates has been found to be the b-axis where the Li+ ion diffuses quickly. The overall capacity and rate performance have, in general, been found to increase with the decrease of thickness of the nanoplates. Hierarchical LFP/C with ∼30 nm thickness shows the best electrochemical performance of 167 mA h g−1, followed by spindle (<20 nm thickness but aggregated, 121 mA h g−1), plates (200–300 nm thickness, 110 mA h g−1) and diamond shaped LFP/C (300–500 nm thickness, 82 mA h g−1) at a current rate of 17mA g−1 (0.1C rate). The spindle shaped LFP/C shows unexpected electrochemical performance since the nanoplates are heavily agglomerated in the bulk which prevents access for the liquid electrolyte, as well as additive Super P carbon, between neighbouring nanoplates during the fabrication of the composite electrodes. Hence, only the peripheral plates of the spindle are actively involved in the insertion/extraction of Li+, while the core of the spindle shaped LFP/C is almost inactive, resulting in moderate storage behaviour.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:78,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A hybrid organic-inorganic porous material was successfully prepared through chemical modification of a non-ordered mesoporous silica, obtained by the sol-gel process, with 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium groups.

The presence of cationic imidazolium groups on the surface of the hybrid silica-based material allowed the electrochemical detection of these biomolecules without any other electron mediator or biomolecular recognition component. Such behavior highlights the potentiality of this material to be applied in the development of new electrochemical sensing devices.

The cathode with 1wt% SWCNT additives showed comparable active material capacity (185–188mAhg−1), at a low rate, and Coulombic efficiency to the cathode composite with 4wt% Super C65. At increased cycling rates, the cathode with SWCNT additives had higher capacity retention with more than three times the capacity at 10C (16.4mAcm−2). The thermal stability of the electrodes was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry after charging to 4.3V and float charging for 12h. A 40% reduction of the cathode exothermic energy released was measured when using 1wt% SWCNTs as the additive.

The origin of the poor electrochemical inactivity of LiCrO2 has not been clarified for decades. Here an irreversible phase transformation from the layered to the rock-salt structure is observed at atomic scale in partially electrochemical delithiated LiCrO2: Cr ions migrate from Cr layers into Li layers in the surface regions. The Cr ions at Li layers in the surface regions could block extraction of lithium from the interior regions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Cr ions in Li layers can stabilize the structure in the Li-poor area, but the diffusion energy barrier of Li ions will be greatly increased. It is proposed accordingly that the surface phase transformation and the blocking of diffusion channel are the main origin for the poor electrochemical reactivity of LiCrO2. Such a surface blocking phenomenon may be a common origin for inactivity of some cathode materials, in which cation mixing become significant after initial delithiation. In addition, Cr ions in LiCrO2 are oxidized only from Cr3+ to Cr4+ during electrochemical delithiation, instead of Cr6+ as usually expected, based on synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) studies.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:82,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;A novel series of cathode materials based on lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) for Li-ion batteries are synthesized by comprehensive utilization of solvothermal technique and high temperature calcination method.

SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were subsequently used to analyze the changes in the microstructure such as crystal orientation and pore size. From these tests, it was found that cathode and anode coatings have distinct deformation mechanisms. The cathode develops a number of micro cracks on the surface before reaching final failure, while the anode maintains its integrity until later stages of deformation. The separator also shows unique stages of deformation such as elongation of fibrils and formation of new pores until reaching final onset of failure.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:84,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Nickel cobalt (Ni–Co) molybdates with different stoichiometric nickel and cobalt ratios have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method.

The results have shown that the examined separator membranes, particularly those based on the PVdF co-polymers, are able to uptake large liquid amounts leading to high ionic conductivity values. Tests performed on Li/LiFePO4 and Li/Sn–C cells have revealed very good cycling performance even at high current rates and 100% of DOD, approaching the results achieved in liquid electrolytes. A capacity fading lower than 0.002% per cycle was observed. Particularly, the Li/LiFePO4 cathode cells have exhibited excellent rate capability, being still able to deliver at 2C above 89% of the capacity discharged at 0.1C. These results, in conjunction with the about 100% coulombic efficiency, suggest very good electrolyte/electrode compatibility, which results from the high purity and stability of the electrolyte and electrode materials and the cell manufacturing.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:90,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The development of improved State-of-Health (SoH) diagnostic methods is a current research topic for battery-powered applications. For instance, the current rapid development of Electric Vehicles (EV) creates a strong demand for an accurate and reliable on-board SoH indicator during operation. Such an indicator is a key parameter required to optimize battery energy management and to track the degradation of the system performance. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of an electrochemical system is a powerful lab-based diagnostic technique, usually measured using a frequency response analyzer. In this paper, we present an innovative diagnostic technique based on analysis of free voltage and current signals to give a so called “quasi-electrochemical impedance spectrum” (QEIS) and demonstrate its application on a Li-ion battery during a real EV duty cycle. It is worth noting that in our technique no additional signal is applied to the cell, since the current flowing into cells during use on-board is directly processed in the data treatment step. Commercial batteries (1.4Ah cylindrical LiFePO4/graphite cell) were selected in this study to validate the diagnostic method in the framework of an applied case study related to an electric school bus demonstrator. In order to study the capability of QEIS measurements as a diagnostic tool for SoH of Li-ion cells, a test procedure including ageing phases has been defined to characterise Li-ion cells before and during ageing. Voltage and current signals were treated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to determine the QEIS spectra of Li-ion cells under study. Then, SoH prediction algorithms have been obtained from a mathematical analysis of the impedance parameters sensitive to SoH.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:91,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;This paper uses a semiparametric latent variable transformation model for multiple outcomes to examine the effect of education and maternal education on female multidimensional well-being and proposes a procedure to build a well-being index that is less susceptible to functional form misspecification. We model multidimensional well-being as an unobserved common factor underlying the observed well-being outcomes. The semiparametric methodology allows us to alleviate misspecification bias by combining multiple indicators into a latent construct in an unspecified, data-driven way. Using data from female participants of the 1974–2010 waves of the US General Social Survey, we find that education, intelligence, and maternal education contribute positively to multidimensional well-being. However, the effects of education and maternal education on female multidimensional well-being declined steadily between the mid-1970s and the 1990s, and have not rebounded since.\n&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:92,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The aim of this paper is to optimize the number of collectors for PV/T hybrid active solar still. The number of PV/T collectors connected in series has been integrated with the basin of solar still. The optimization of number of collectors for different heat capacity of water has been carried out on the basis of energy and exergy. Expressions of inner glass, outer glass and water temperature have been derived for the hybrid active solar system. For the numerical computations data of a summer day (May 22, 2008) for Delhi climatic condition have been used. It has been observed that with increase of the mass of water in the basin increases the optimum number of collector. However the daily and exergy efficiency decreases linearly and nonlinearly with increase of water mass. It has been observed that the maximum yield occurs at N =4 for 50kg of water mass on the basis of exergy efficiency. The thermal model has also been experimentally validated.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;We determined the genotoxicity of 39 chemicals currently in use as food additives.

We tested groups of four male ddY mice once orally with each additive at up to 0.5×LD50 or the limit dose (2000mg/kg) and performed the comet assay on the glandular stomach, colon, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, brain, and bone marrow 3 and 24h after treatment. Of all the additives, dyes were the most genotoxic. Amaranth, Allura Red, New Coccine, Tartrazine, Erythrosine, Phloxine, and Rose Bengal induced dose-related DNA damage in the glandular stomach, colon, and/or urinary bladder. All seven dyes induced DNA damage in the gastrointestinal organs at a low dose (10 or 100mg/kg). Among them, Amaranth, Allura Red, New Coccine, and Tartrazine induced DNA damage in the colon at close to the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). Two antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)), three fungicides (biphenyl, sodium o-phenylphenol, and thiabendazole), and four sweeteners (sodium cyclamate, saccharin, sodium saccharin, and sucralose) also induced DNA damage in gastrointestinal organs.

The SAO structure is extracted using Python tools to identify the potential hotspots of technology demand, the domain dictionary and professional corpus are introduced, and the clustering of technology demand is realized by applying Word2Vec and HowNet to calculate the semantic similarity among the SAO structures. The layout of the technology demand in the different stages of the technical lifecycle is divided by constructing a technology map. The proposed model is validated as an example of the network technology demand text of the new energy and energy saving fields. Therefore, the hotspots of technology demand are the technology of new energy vehicle motor and its control system, technology of energy efficient and technology of wind power, and the new energy vehicle technology is still in the research and development (R&amp;D) stage. Moreover, solar energy products and production equipment are still in the technical application stage. This study provides an effective method for identifying potential technology demand and based on technology lifecycle to implement the layout and visualization of demand, which will make the decision support for guiding the direction of technology R&amp;D, optimizing the allocation of science and technology resources, and promoting the effective docking of technology supply and demand.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;non-battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mg-Al-Pb-Zn alloy is a typical anode material used for high-power seawater activated battery.

Microstructure characterization and half-cell test demonstrate that the selected optimal Mg-6%Al-7%Pb-0.5%Zn (wt%) alloy is a good candidate as an anode material for seawater activated battery application due to its high discharge activity, negative discharge potential in large current densities and comparatively higher anode utilization efficiency.

The morphological transition of the Mo microspheres to hierarchical MoS2 nanoflower architectures is observed to be accomplished with change in solvent from ethylenediamine to water. The resultant marigold flower-like MoS2 nanostructures are few layers thick with poor crystallinity while spherical ball-like molybdenum microspheres exhibit better crystalline nature. This is the first report pertaining to the synthesis of Mo microspheres and MoS2 nanoflowers without using any surfactant, template or substrate in hydro/solvothermal regime. It is opined that such nanoarchitectures of MoS2 are useful candidates for energy related applications such as hydrogen evolution reaction, Li ion battery and pseudocapacitors.

The copper nanowires were protected from corrosion and oxidation by the PANI nanotubes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was performed for the microanalysis of the copper deposition into the polyaniline nanotubes.

The carbon nanostructures were deposited onto a bare gold disc electrode by a vapor deposition process. In the next step, the fullerene was electrochemically polymerized under cyclic voltammetric conditions. The obtained composites are electrochemically active at negative potentials due to the reduction of the fullerene moieties. The voltammetric response corresponding to this electrochemical process depends on the type of nanostructure and the amount of material deposited at the electrode surface. Such systems exhibit promising electrochemical properties. The highest capacitance of about 1000Fg−1, with respect to mass of polymer, was obtained for the SWCNTs/C60-Pd composite. This value is about four times higher compared to the capacitance of the polymer deposited on a bare gold electrode surface. Lower values of the specific capacitance were obtained for composites containing other MWCNTs and ox-CNOs. For the C60-Pd/ox-CNOs composites the highest values of the specific capacitance were found to be about 280Fg−1.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;abstract&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Spinel lithium manganese oxides with a nominal composition of LiM0.05Mn1.95O4 (M=Mn, Li, Al, Co, Ni, or B) are prepared and their degradation mechanisms encountered in lithium secondary cells are investigated. Among the degradation mechanisms proposed in previous reports, those arising either from cation mixing or from the formation of oxygen-deficient spinels are negligible in these materials, but a certain amount of spinel dissolution is observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the spinel lattice experiences an appreciable change in volume during charge–discharge cycling. The extent of this change depends on the nature of dopant. Compared to the undoped spinel, the lattice expansion/contraction according to Li+ insertion/removal is more significant in the B-doped spinel, but it is smaller in the case of Ni-, Co-, Al-, or Li-doped spinels. Spinels experiencing a smaller volume change maintain their structural integrity, even after prolonged cell cycling, such that there is a better capacity retention. In the B-doped spinel, however, the spinel lattice is largely collapsed and new phases are formed after cell cycling. This results in poor cycleability. It is proposed that the structural breakdown due to the repeated change in lattice volume is the most important failure mode in these materials. Spinel dissolution plays a second major role.&quot;},&quot;label&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;battery&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:32663,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzAxNywic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL2JhdHRlcnlkYXRhL3BhcGVyLWFic3RyYWN0cyIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjYxNywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.XttAJ7-NYSnDcal4o35fx-MTanhGHJQjUdgGvLOz7xZ6KK3QdYbWuCoy1hxnmOqnzv4OAu5RRPHQS1J0xbK8Dg&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;batterydata/paper-abstracts&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;61958f36f73cb8ad8f5ce018&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/10dbd81a73ea7df1eed95bc378c58920.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Shu Huang&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;batterydata&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:18},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

Recently, the number of cases of contact allergic dermatitis among beauticians specialized in sculpting artificial nails has increased. Objective Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates in beauticians and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting artificial nails over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 beauticians and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32.2 years, and 26.7% had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients —2 beauticians and 1 client— presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7/15, 46.7%), 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%), and methyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%). Conclusions Acrylate monomers used for sculpting artificial nails are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention.</span></div></div>

Although a number of all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) models have been developed by several VRFB modeling groups, a comparative study of these two ion transport mechanisms has not been clearly reported in the literature. In this study, we develop a three-dimensional (3-D), transient VRFB model that rigorously accounts for both diffusion and migration mechanisms of charged species, including V2+, V3+, VO2+,VO2 + and H+. The VRFB model relies upon five principles of conservation: mass, momentum, species, electric charge, and thermal energy. Due to the general form of the conservation equations, both species migration effects on species transport and species diffusion effects on charge transport are considered in the source terms of the model equations. The model calculates species migration and diffusion fluxes through the membrane and compares their relative magnitudes under various charging and discharging stages. This paper clearly elucidates the role of species migration on vanadium crossover and the subsequent capacity losses, demonstrating that the present VRFB model is a valuable tool for optimizing the component design and operation of VRFBs.</span></div></div>

In this work, a systematic effect of pre-treatment potential of screen-printed carbon (SPCE) surface on the HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 was carried out. A new observation of a low potential HER (onset potential, E onset = −0.02 V vs. RHE) at a cathodic potential, −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl on 1 hr pre-treated screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE*, * = pre-treated) was observed. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations of the SPCE* by field emission scanning electron-microscope, Raman, IR and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopes reveals specific generation of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon surface and in turn for the enhanced HER on the modified electrode surface. Electrochemical characterization of SPCE* with Fe(CN)6 3− support the observation. A marked decrement in the peak current and significant increase in the peak-to-peak separation potential response due electrostatic repulsion between the anion sites of Fe(CN)6 3− and –COO– were noticed. This observation is in parallel with the reduced electrical double layer capacitance value of the SPCE* system. The E onset and Tafel value (54.7 mV dec−1) obtained here are comparable to those at Pt, MoS2, MoSe2 and superior over the N- and P-doped graphene/carbon electrocatalysts for HER. A prototype HER system was developed and demonstrated for H2 gas production at a rate of 0.0053 μM s−1 (Operating potential = −0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl), which is comparable to that of precious metal and metal compound electrocatalysts based HER performance.</span></div></div>

Disaster prone points can be very closely monitored by augmenting the distribution of wireless sensor networks. However, replacing the battery of electronics regularly remains a significant challenge especially in a remote area. In this study, we report a wind-driven hybridized energy harvester which is designed for rotating energy harvesting and can be integrated with WSN technology to develop a self-powered natural disaster monitoring system. In this harvester, the rotator is directly driven by external rotational motion thus can easily hybridize the TENG with eighteen EMGs. Consequently, the fully packaged WH-EH device combining with the water-proof flexible solar cell can be completely isolated from the harsh wilderness environment. The output feature of TENG of high voltage but low current that perfectly compensate for the differing performance of EMG to achieve an excellent output power of the hybrid device with a broad frequency range. Moreover, the WH-EH is capable of lighting hundreds of LEDs and powering small electronics. The quick-acting charging ability of a capacitor by the WH-EH was conducted effectively in experimental tests. Finally, three self-powered sensor systems enabled by a single WH-EH were discussed and demonstrated, including a temperature sensor for forest fire detection, a vibration sensor for earthquake monitoring and a wireless transceiver for alarm information spreading. Obviously, the invention of the hybridized nanogenerator will be of great importance to promote the development of self-powered wireless sensor networks and provide a sustainable power-supply solution to long-term natural disaster monitoring stations in residential or remote areas.</span></div></div>

The resulting electrolytes exhibit electrochemical stability at 4.5V against lithium metal and a conductivity value of (2.0–2.1)×10−3 Scm−1 at room temperature. The GFC–PGE electrolytes show excellent strength and flexibility when used in batteries even if they contain a plasticiser. A test cell with LiCoO2 as a positive electrode and mesophase pich-based carbon fibre (MCF) as a negative electrode display a capacity of 110mAhg−1 based on the positive electrode weight at the 0.2C rate at room temperature.

Geometry and sizes are the most important parameters of an anode to obtain batteries with high cycling stability without irreversible losses. The wires are prepared with a unique etching fabrication method, which allows to fabricate wires of very precise sizes. In order to investigate how good randomly oriented silicon wires perform in contrast to the perfect order of the array, the wires are embedded in a paste. This study reveals the fundamental correlation between geometry, mechanics and charge transfer kinetics of silicon electrodes. Using a suitable RC equivalent circuit allows to evaluate data from cyclic voltammetry and simultaneous FFT-Impedance Spectroscopy (FFT-IS), yielding in time-resolved resistances, time constants, and their direct correlation to the phase transformations. The change of the resistances during lithiation and delithiation correlates to kinetics and charge transfer mechanisms. This study demonstrates how the mechanical and physiochemical interactions at the silicon/paste interface inside the paste electrodes lead to void formation around silicon and with it to material loss and capacity fading.</span></div></div>

The study shows that a simple soaking treatment in hydrochloric acid for the skimmed cotton before its high-temperature carbonization can critically impact the structure and the electrochemical properties of the obtained hard carbon significantly. This hard carbon exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency (73%) and superior cycling stability and rate capability (253 mAh g−1 and 165 mAh g−1 at 40 mA g−1 and 4000 mA g−1, respectively) due to its unique porous architecture and large surface area. The full cell by coupling the hard carbon with a cathode material, i.e. potassium-rich iron hexacyanoferrate shows an outstanding electrochemical performance.

In the present study, we investigated the LH strategies employed by two groups of Polish men: incarcerated offenders (N = 84) as well as soldiers and firefighters (N = 117), whose professions involve an elevated risk of injury and premature death. The subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables. Although biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators should be closely linked with each other, the actual connection between them is unclear. Thus, this study was driven by two aims: comparing LH strategies in two groups of men with a high risk of premature morbidity-mortality and investigating the relationship between the biodemographic and psychosocial LH dimensions. The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators. The results strengthen the legitimacy of incorporating biodemographic LH traits into research models and indicate the need for further research on the accuracy of the Mini-K. The possible explanations for the intergroup differences in LH strategies are discussed.</span></div></div>

While both anode and cathode materials are important for high performance ASCs, more research effort has been devoted to developing cathode materials because the energy source of an ASC is mostly attributed to the cathode. However, the development of anode materials is essential in order to achieve high power density as well as stable long-term cycle life of ASCs. In this study, functionalized graphene aerogel (GA) decorated with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles is used as an efficient ASC anode material. The high surface area (328m2 g−1) and low electrical resistivity (50 times lower than one without Pd) of the GA composite grants a high specific capacitance (175.8Fg−1 at 5mVs−1), excllent rate capability (48.3% retention after a 10 fold increase of scan rate), and remarkable reversibility. ASCs assembled from manganese dioxide (cathode) and GA composite (anode) show stable extended cell voltage, fast charge–discharge capability, excellent cycle stability (89.6% retention after 3000 cycles), and high energy and power densities (average of 13.9Whkg−1 and 13.3kWkg−1).

High human Pb burdens are accompanied by elevated concentrations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in soils and house dust within the city, which has a long history of mining and metallurgy. In this study enrichment-levels for PHEs in soils are quantified and compared to environmental quality guidelines and a statistically-derived estimation of background concentration. In addition, Pb isotopes (207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) are used to characterise the isotopic signatures of potential point sources of Pb and a mixing model employed to quantify the contribution of sources to Pb present in soils, house dust, and the scalp hair of children and young people. Pb isotopic evidence suggests that Pb in surface soils and house-dust is predominantly sourced from historical deposition of Pb-containing aerosols from metal smelting, with lower contributions from wind-blown dispersal of metalliferous waste. Pb present in scalp hair is interpreted as the result of non-occupational exposure and the ingestion and/or inhalation of Pb-enriched surface soil and house dust. This study represents one of the very few instances where this type of geochemical tracing technique has been successfully applied to definitively identify the source of Pb present within biological samples. The results of this study are of particular relevance to environmental management and highlight the human health risk posed by the legacy of now inactive mining and metallurgy in addition to the challenge posed in mitigating the risk posed by diffuse soil pollution.</span></div></div>

The paper reports results of the technical–economic optimization study of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage in Algeria. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the appropriate dimension of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel with battery storage that guarantee the energy autonomy of typical remote consumer with lowest cost of energy. A secondary aim is to study the impact of renewable energy potential quality on the system size. The optimum dimensions of the system are defined for six sites in Algeria. In this context, a complete sizing model is developed in Matlab/Simulink V.6.5, able to predict the optimum system configuration. The simulation results indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study. Thus, it provides higher system performance than photovoltaic or wind alone. It s shown that the principal advantage of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage are used all together, the reliability of the system is enhanced. The economic analysis has resulted in the calculation of kWh cost of energy for different types of resources and optimized cost of hybrid energy system. It s revealed too that the energy cost depends largely on the renewable energy potential quality. So, our objective for the optimization parameters is not the production cost but the offered service.</span></div></div>

In this situation, there are higher possibilities of placing the wrong cassettes back to the wrong positions, so that the human errors will lead to a crucial impact on total inpatients undoubtedly. Therefore, this study aims to design the RFID (Radio frequency identification) position based system (PBS) for the ATPM with passive high frequency (HF) model. At first, we placed the HF tags on each cassette and installed the HF readers on the cabinets for each position. Then, the system works on the reading loop to verify ID numbers and positions on each cassette. Next, the system would detect whether the orbit opens or not and controls the readers’ working power consumption for drug storage temperature. Finally, we use the RFID PBS of the ATPM to achieve the goal of avoiding the medication errors at any time for patient safety.</span></div></div>

In a sample of 379 adolescents (212 boys, 167 girls), resting RSA was assessed during a laboratory session, and adolescents reported on parental support, negative interaction with parents, empathic concern and externalizing behavior during a home visit. We found no support for high resting RSA predicting low externalizing behavior or high empathic concern. However, in line with our hypotheses, we did find several instances of RSA functioning as a moderator, although the interaction patterns varied. First, negative interaction with parents was a negative predictor of externalizing behavior for girls low in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls with high RSA. Second, higher negative interaction with parents predicted lower empathic concern for boys high in resting RSA, whereas the association was reversed for boys with low resting RSA. Third, parental support was a positive predictor of empathic concern for girls high in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls low in resting RSA. The findings suggest that adolescents with different levels of resting RSA respond differentially to relationship quality with parents.

Avoidance mostly increased with the increasing percent of waste in the mixture showing a dose–response curve. E. fetida was the most sensitive species and E. crypticus the least one. An additional endpoint, (changes in weight after two-day exposure) was not found to be more sensitive than avoidance reaction, but it confirmed that earthworms staying in the highest concentrations of the waste mixture were affected showing apparent weight reduction.

Various measures of mood (i.e., Profile of Mood States and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) were also assessed. Results Cerebral artery elasticity and BFV responsiveness to cognitive tests (neurovascular coupling) correlated with cognitive performance but not with depressive symptoms or mood states. Mood deficits were related to poor cognitive performance. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of adequate cerebral perfusion for optimized cognitive function in healthy postmenopausal women.

Herein, we report a precious-metal-free and carbon-free O2 electrode synthesized via electrodeposition of manganese oxide (MnOx) on a stainless steel (SS) substrate followed by high-temperature calcination at 480 °C. The MnOx–SS electrode displays high oxygen reduction and water oxidation activities when tested in an electrochemical cell, comparable to that of a precious-metal based electrode, Pt/C–SS. Accelerated durability testing reveals the excellent stability of the MnOx–SS electrode compared to both the Pt/C–SS electrode and a carbon-based electrode with MnOx and Ni catalysts. This can be rationalized by the carbon-free nature of the MnOx–SS electrode which circumvents carbon corrosion at the high electrochemical potentials during water oxidation and O2 reduction. Integrating the MnOx–SS electrode as the O2 electrode into an anion exchange membrane (AEM) URFC produces round-trip efficiencies of 42–45% at 20 mA cm−2 over 10 cycles, and exhibits significantly enhanced durability compared to the carbon-based analogue. This work demonstrates the MnOx–SS electrode's potential for use as a high performance, scalable, precious-metal-free and carbon-free O2 electrode in AEM-URFCs and metal–air batteries.

NFT targeted increasing the amplitude of individual’s upper Alpha frequency band at the parietal midline scalp location (Pz), and WMT consisted of an established computerized protocol with working memory updating and set-shifting components. Healthy participants (n = 140) were randomly allocated to five combinations of training, including visual search training used as an active control training for the WMT; all five groups were compared to a sixth silent control group receiving no training. All groups were evaluated before and after training for resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral executive function measures. The participants in the silent control group were unaware of this procedure, and received one of the training protocols only after study has ended. Results demonstrated significant improvement in the practice tasks in all training groups including non-specific influence of NFT on resting-state EEG spectral topography. There was only a near transfer effect (improvement in working memory task) for WMT, which remained significant in the delayed post-test (after 1 month), in comparison to silent control group but not in comparison to active control training group. The NFT + WMT combined group showed improved mental rotation ability both in the post-training and in the follow-up evaluations. This improvement, however, did not differ significantly from that in the silent control group. We conclude that the current training protocols, including their combination, have very limited influence on the executive functions that were assessed in this study.

The decomposition pathway of LGPS at the anode interface is modified by this mechanical constriction design, and the growth of lithium dendrites is inhibited, leading to excellent rate and cycling performances.

Depending on the intensity and time of milling alloys with different microstructure were obtained. The as-milled TiNi1−xMnx alloys contain substantial amount of amorphous phase, which crystallizes during annealing. Annealing of the as-milled fine nanocrystalline materials at 500 °C results only in slight coarsening of the microstructure, which remains still nanocrystalline.

Electrochemical hydrogen charge/discharge cycling of the as-milled as well as of annealed alloys were carried out at galvanostatic conditions. It was found that among the nanocrystalline Ti0.8M0.2Ni0.8N0.2 (M = Zr, V; N = Cu, Mn) alloys TiNi0.8Mn0.2 revealed the highest discharge capacity of 56 mAh g−1 in the as-milled state and 75 mAh g−1 after short-time annealing at 500 °C.

The as-milled TiNi1−xMnx alloys with x ≤ 0.4 reveal noticeably higher discharge capacity and better cycle life than the Mn-richer alloys. Based on potentiostatic experiments the diffusion coefficients of hydrogen into TiNi alloys in two different microstructural states (fine and coarser nanocrystalline) as well as in as-milled amorphous/nanocrystalline and nanocrystalline TiNi0.8Mn0.2 were determined. The hydrogen diffusion coefficients of the TiNi alloys are comparable (1.9–2.7 × 10−12 cm2 s−1). The diffusion coefficient in the as-milled amorphous/nanocrystalline TiNi0.8Mn0.2 was found to be 3–4 times higher than that of the as-milled nanocrystalline alloy.</span></div></div>

The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators.

A common option for accommodating the uncertain disturbances and their cumulative effects is to introduce battery into a properly structured system. However, by using an ad hoc approach, these schemes may be either overdesigned or inoperable. A generic mathematical programming model is thus adopted in the present study to compute a so-called temporal flexibility index for use as a performance measure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this assessment criterion, a large collection of photovoltaic–fuel cell (PVFC) systems can be configured for a specific application and then compared accordingly so as to identify the best combination of energy supply ratio and battery capacity.

The 700°C-annealed film exhibited excellent discharge capacity approximated to the theoretical capacity.</span></div></div>

The two cells have the same configuration consisting of a nanoporous gold (NPG) air electrode and a ceramic separator of fast sodium ion conductor, NASICON. Only the selection of catholyte, either alkyl carbonate-based nonaqueous solution of NaClO4 or aqueous solution of NaOH, is different. All performances are demonstrated to be better for the aqueous one. Lower overpotential of aqueous cell leads to better round-trip efficiency. A large resistance relevant to oxygen reduction reaction in the nonaqueous cell is relieved by changing the catholyte to the aqueous electrolyte, affording higher rate capability and power density. The aqueous electrolyte is also effective to remove the limitation of the discharge capacity defined by the volumetric amount of air electrode, as has been claimed in previous studies on aqueous Na-air cells. Furthermore, the aqueous cell is demonstrated to be robust and less sensitive and to atmosphere. The NPG electrode works reversibly in the half-cell reaction of the aqueous cell, while an electrodeposition of metallic Na on the anode during charging requires an improvement.</span></div></div>

To elucidate this relationship, we conducted a multimodal fusion analysis on the functional network connectivity (FNC) and gray matter density from MRI data from 13 BD, 40 MDD, and 33 matched healthy controls (HC). A data-driven fusion method called mCCA+jICA was used to identify the co-altered FNC and gray matter components. Comparing to HC, BD exhibited reduced gray matter density in the parietal and occipital cortices, which correlated with attenuated functional connectivity within sensory and motor networks, as well as hyper-connectivity in regions that are putatively engaged in cognitive control. In addition, lower gray matter density was found in MDD in the amygdala and cerebellum. High accuracy in discriminating across groups was also achieved by trained classification models, implying that features extracted from the fusion analysis hold the potential to ultimately serve as diagnostic biomarkers for mood disorders.</span></div></div>

To determine personal exposures to various particulate matter (PM) size fractions, a recently evaluated personal PM monitor capable of direct PM10–2.5 size fraction collection was used.

The median for this measurement from all participants (50th percentile) was 13.7μg/m3. A coefficient of determination (r 2) of 0.02 was established for community-based PM10–2.5 mass concentrations versus personal exposures.

A previous pilot study has shown that minocycline, a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline, is effective in treating for negative and/or cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Objectives The present study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of minocycline for the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Ninety-two patients with early stage schizophrenia treated with risperidone entered this 16-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive minocycline (200mg per day) or the placebo. The primary outcome was evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Secondary outcomes included the response rate of SANS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and cognitive tests. Results Subjects receiving minocycline had greater improvements on SANS total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores (P&lt;0.001) when compared with those receiving the placebo. Rates of treatment response (43.6%) in the minocycline group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group (10.0%) after 16weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference between the seven cognitive domains (P>0.05), except for the attention domain (P=0.044). Conclusions The addition of minocycline to atypical antipsychotic drugs in early schizophrenia had significant efficacy on negative symptoms but had a slight effect on the attention domains of patients with schizophrenia. It may be considered as a new adjunct treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT01493622.</span></div></div>

With the right external stimulus, the need for human interaction, sensors, and batteries will be eliminated, and by using additive manufacturing, more complex devices and parts can be produced. With the current understanding of shape memory mechanisms and with improved design for additive manufacturing, reversibility in 4D printing has recently been proven to be feasible. Conventional one-way 4D printing requires human interaction in the programming (or shape-setting) phase, but reversible 4D printing, or two-way 4D printing, will fully eliminate the need for human interference, as the programming stage is replaced with another stimulus. This allows reversible 4D printed parts to be fully dependent on external stimuli; parts can also be potentially reused after every recovery, or even used in continuous cycles—an aspect that carries industrial appeal. This paper presents a review on the mechanisms of shape memory materials that have led to 4D printing, current findings regarding 4D printing in alloys and polymers, and their respective limitations. The reversibility of shape memory materials and their feasibility to be fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing are summarized and critically analyzed. For reversible 4D printing, the methods of 3D printing, mechanisms used for actuation, and strategies to achieve reversibility are also highlighted. Finally, prospective future research directions in reversible 4D printing are suggested.</span></div></div>

The electrochemical anionic regulation process ensures general release of the regulation reagents for precise substitution of sulfur anions in pristine hydroxide.

Here, we employ a binary Ba and Ti-based hybrid surface treatment on LiCoO2 (LCO@BT) by facile wet chemical routes. This strategy integrates the advantages of both interface particle doping and surface coating as the layered structure of LCO is stabilized by a binary hybrid surface treatment, and the modified layer promotes the surface Li+ diffusivity and protects the LCO cathode from steady corrosion induced by surface side reaction. On the basis of in-situ NMR characterizations, it is found that after the first electrochemical delithiation/lithiation the phase reversibly changes from O3–I-type in LCO@BT and back to O3–I-type LxCO@BT (0.98 ≤ x＜1) rather than to a two-phase domain of O3–I and O3-II phase in uncoated LxCO (x＜0.98). The target material is achievable in displaying an initial discharge capacity of 190.5 mAh g−1 and delivers a high capacity retention of 90.29% (172 mAh g−1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles which is superior to most LiCoO2 cathodes that are operated at high cut-off voltage of 4.5V.</span></div></div>

Age estimates based on the intraallelic microsatellite variation indicate that the −13910*T allele, which is more tightly associated with lactase persistence, originated in Eurasia before the Neolithic and after the emergence of modern humans outside Africa. We detected significant departures from neutrality for the −13910*T variant in geographically and evolutionary distant populations from southern Europe (Portuguese and Italians) and Africa (Fulbe) by using a neutrality test based on the congruence between the frequency of the allele and the levels of intraallelic variability measured by the number of mutations in adjacent microsatellites. This result supports the role of selection in the evolution of lactase persistence, ruling out possible confounding effects from recombination suppression and population history. Reevaluation of the available evidence on variation of the −13910 and −22018 loci indicates that lactase persistence probably originated from different mutations in Europe and most of Africa, even if 13910*T is not the causal allele, suggesting that selective pressure could have promoted the convergent evolution of the trait.

The charge compensation in Li2−x TMSiO4 upon delithiation is found to be achieved first by a combined reversible TM and oxygen redox process, originating from the dynamic response of their electronic structures to the Li ions (or electrons) removal and the associated charge transfer from the O to Fe ions, and then by the irreversible formation of O vacancy (VO) that destroys the host stability of these materials. Whether the formation of VO in these materials upon delithiation would occur is demonstrated to be essentially determined by the energy level of their highest occupied electronic states and can be understood by the defect charge transition mechanism which provides a quantitative way to estimate to what extent the oxygen redox could be reversibly used in a cathode that being important for the future design of high-capacity cathode materials.</span></div></div>

Further development has been highly boosted by a large and enthusiastic effort up to a current maximum efficiency of 24.2%. The exceptionality of this class of materials resides in their soft character combined with long diffusion lengths of the photo-generated carriers, a wide absorption range and direct tunable bandgap. Nonetheless, the low structural stability of the hybrid perovskites, primary MAPbI3, risks to severely retard their wide-range applications in low-cost/high-yield devices. Focused research is currently relating instability sources and degradation mechanisms with the operation conditions, including temperature, illumination, humidity, contaminants and interfacing materials. Although the overall scenario is brighter than years ago, reliable and long-lasting solutions to avoid back-reaction of perovskites to the starting byproducts and indeed to extend cell durability are under spotlight. For the market uptake, moreover, device architectures to be produced via simple and sequential steps, free of contaminants and at low environmental impact, are warmly encouraged to catch the interest of investors. The paper will thus frame strengths and weaknesses of hybrid perovskites for next-generation photovoltaics in view of their extended use and dissemination in daily life.</span></div></div>

Given the costs of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), alternative ambulatory methods for accurate diagnosis are desirable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a simple device (SleepCheck) to identify patients with sleep apnea. A total of 30 consecutive patients with suspected OSA syndrome referred to the sleep clinic were prospectively evaluated with standard PSG and SleepCheck simultaneously during an in-laboratory, supervised full-night diagnostic study. The PSG apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) was evaluated according to standard criteria, and SleepCheck assessed the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) based on nasal cannula pressure fluctuations. Compared to the full-night PSG, SleepCheck systematically overscored respiratory events (the mean difference between SleepCheck RDI and PSG AHI was 27.4±13.3 events per hour). This overscoring was in part related to normal physiologic decreases in flow during rapid eye movement sleep or after an arousal. However, there was reasonable correlation between AHI and RDI (r=0.805). Receiver operating characteristic curves with threshold values of AHI of 10 and 20/h demonstrated areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.915 and 0.910, respectively. Optimum combinations of sensitivity and specificity for these thresholds were calculated as 86.4/75.0 and 88.9/81.0, respectively. Overall, the SleepCheck substantially overscored apneas and hypopneas in patients with suspected OSA. However, after correction of the bias, the SleepCheck had reasonable accuracy with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity similar to other ambulatory type 4 devices currently available.</span></div></div>

Previous studies have reported that adaptive shifts in behavior are accompanied by changes of neural activity in frontal cortex. However, neural and behavioral adaptations can occur at multiple time scales, and their relationship remains poorly defined. Here we developed an adaptive sensorimotor decision-making task for head-fixed mice, requiring them to shift flexibly between multiple auditory–motor mappings. Two-photon calcium imaging of secondary motor cortex (M2) revealed different ensemble activity states for each mapping. When adapting to a conditional mapping, transitions in ensemble activity were abrupt and occurred before the recovery of behavioral performance. By contrast, gradual and delayed transitions accompanied shifts toward repetitive responding. These results demonstrate distinct ensemble signatures associated with the start versus end of sensory-guided behavior and suggest that M2 leads in engaging goal-directed response strategies that require sensorimotor associations.

Different secondary or impurity phases, forming during either synthesis or subsequent redox process under normal operating conditions, can have a significant impact on the performance of the electrode. The exploration of the electronic and chemical structures of impurity phases is crucial to understand such influence. We have embarked on a series of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy studies for the element speciation in various impurity phase materials relevant to LiFePO4 for Li ion batteries. In the present report, soft-X-ray XANES spectra of Li K-edge, P L2,3-edge, O K-edge and Fe L2,3-edge have been obtained for LiFePO4 in crystalline, disordered and amorphous forms and some possible “impurities”, including LiPO3, Li4P2O7, Li3PO4, Fe3(PO4)2, FePO4, and Fe2O3. The results indicate that each element from different pure reference compounds exhibits unique spectral features in terms of energy position, shape and intensity of the resonances in its XANES. In addition, inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) reveals the surface vs. bulk property of the specimens. Therefore, the spectral data provided here can be used as standards in the future for phase composition analysis.

Standardized test methods prescribe fixed testing conditions e.g. specific temperature, pH, light intensity etc. However, environmental conditions under which the organisms live are rarely identical to the standard conditions. Thus, the ecotoxicity of compounds found in standard test is not only a function of the compounds inherent physico-chemical properties but is also affected by test conditions. It is therefore important to study the effect of changes in test conditions in order to get reliable input ecotoxicity data for assessing the potential risk posed by a compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the implications of changing test conditions on the toxicity of four sulfonylurea herbicides (SUs). The toxicity of the four SUs towards Lemna gibba was investigated at three pH levels (6, 7.5 and 9), at two temperatures (15 and 24 °C) and two light regimes (continuous and 12:12 h light:dark cycle) The EC50 increased twofold to tenfold for the four SUs when pH was increased from 6 to 9. Decreasing the temperature from 24 to 15 °C or introducing a dark:light cycle did not cause any trends in changes in toxicity. The results show that test conditions can have an effect on the toxicity and this should be considered when the standard test results are used for derivation of EQS.

This paper found that the long-term potential of biofuels to contribute to GHG reduction goals will depend not only on the rates of technological development of the second generation biofuels but also on the development of other advanced vehicles. In the medium term, the potential contribution of biofuels to rural development and realising a recycle-based society could become significant depending on the progress of technology for both second generation biofuel production and the collection and transportation of their feedstocks.

In many studies an inverse relationship has been observed, among both men and women, between 2D:4D ratio and measures of athletic ability. It has been further suggested that, in hunter-gatherer populations, 2D:4D ratio might also be negatively correlated with hunting ability, itself assumed to be contingent on athleticism. This hypothesis has been tested using endurance running performance among runners from a Western, educated, and industrialized population as a proximate measure of hunting ability. However, it has not previously been tested among actual hunter-gatherers using more ecologically valid measures of hunting ability and success. The current study addresses this question among Tanzanian Hadza hunter-gatherers. I employ a novel method of assessing hunting reputation that, unlike previous methods, allows granular distinctions to be made between hunters at all levels of perceived ability. I find no statistically significant relationship between digit ratio and either hunting reputation or two important hunting skills. I confirm that Hadza men have higher mean 2D:4D ratios than men in many Western populations. I discuss the notion that 2D:4D ratio may be the consequence of an allometric scaling relationship between relative and absolute finger lengths. Although it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from these results, the current study provides no support for the theorized relationship between 2D:4D ratio and hunting skill.</span></div></div>

In this paper, a reduced-order capacity-loss model for graphite anodes is derived based upon the salient physical loss mechanisms to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model fidelity. This model captures the two primary degradation mechanisms that occur in the graphite anode of a typical lithium ion cell: a) capacity loss due to Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer growth, and b) capacity loss due to isolation of active material. The model is calibrated and validated for a commercial 2.3-Ah cell with a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cathode and graphite anode. One data set is used for calibration, another four experimental data sets are used for validation. The model matches experimental capacity degradation results within a 20% error.

Higher age and longer CPR durations statistically influenced frequency of sternal and rib fractures (p &lt; 0.001). The mean number of fractured ribs did not vary significantly between the groups (6 ± 3 vs. 7 ± 2, p = 0.09). In this cohort with unsuccessful CPR, chest compression-related injuries were more frequent following ACCD application than in the mCC group, but with only minutely increased odds ratios. The severity of injuries did not differ between the groups, and no iatrogenic injury was declared by the forensic pathologist as being fatal. In the clinical routine after successful return of spontaneous circulation a computed tomography scan for CPR-associated injuries is recommended as soon as possible.

The influence of solvents on the morphology of the LFP in the solvothermal synthesis is also investigated. A uniform carbon coverage at the surfaces has been achieved by a selective chelating carbonising source, D-gluconic acid lactone. The smallest dimension of the nanoplates has been found to be the b-axis where the Li+ ion diffuses quickly. The overall capacity and rate performance have, in general, been found to increase with the decrease of thickness of the nanoplates. Hierarchical LFP/C with ∼30 nm thickness shows the best electrochemical performance of 167 mA h g−1, followed by spindle (&lt;20 nm thickness but aggregated, 121 mA h g−1), plates (200–300 nm thickness, 110 mA h g−1) and diamond shaped LFP/C (300–500 nm thickness, 82 mA h g−1) at a current rate of 17mA g−1 (0.1C rate). The spindle shaped LFP/C shows unexpected electrochemical performance since the nanoplates are heavily agglomerated in the bulk which prevents access for the liquid electrolyte, as well as additive Super P carbon, between neighbouring nanoplates during the fabrication of the composite electrodes. Hence, only the peripheral plates of the spindle are actively involved in the insertion/extraction of Li+, while the core of the spindle shaped LFP/C is almost inactive, resulting in moderate storage behaviour.

The dispersion of 1wt% high purity laser-produced SWCNTs in a LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 electrode created an improved percolation network over an equivalent composite electrode using 4wt% Super C65 carbon black; evidenced by additive connectivity in SEM images and an order of magnitude increase in electrode electrical conductivity. The cathode with 1wt% SWCNT additives showed comparable active material capacity (185–188mAhg−1), at a low rate, and Coulombic efficiency to the cathode composite with 4wt% Super C65. At increased cycling rates, the cathode with SWCNT additives had higher capacity retention with more than three times the capacity at 10C (16.4mAcm−2). The thermal stability of the electrodes was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry after charging to 4.3V and float charging for 12h. A 40% reduction of the cathode exothermic energy released was measured when using 1wt% SWCNTs as the additive. Thus, the results demonstrate that replacing traditional conductive carbon additives with a lower weight loading of SWCNTs is a simple way to improve the thermal transport, safety, power, and energy characteristics of cathode composites for lithium ion batteries.</span></div></div>

The origin of the poor electrochemical inactivity of LiCrO2 has not been clarified for decades. Here an irreversible phase transformation from the layered to the rock-salt structure is observed at atomic scale in partially electrochemical delithiated LiCrO2: Cr ions migrate from Cr layers into Li layers in the surface regions. The Cr ions at Li layers in the surface regions could block extraction of lithium from the interior regions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Cr ions in Li layers can stabilize the structure in the Li-poor area, but the diffusion energy barrier of Li ions will be greatly increased. It is proposed accordingly that the surface phase transformation and the blocking of diffusion channel are the main origin for the poor electrochemical reactivity of LiCrO2. Such a surface blocking phenomenon may be a common origin for inactivity of some cathode materials, in which cation mixing become significant after initial delithiation. In addition, Cr ions in LiCrO2 are oxidized only from Cr3+ to Cr4+ during electrochemical delithiation, instead of Cr6+ as usually expected, based on synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) studies.</span></div></div>

In this study, micro-scale deformation and failure of fully-discharged battery components including an anode, a cathode, and a separator were investigated at room temperature. Nanoindentation tests and in-situ tensile tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM) were carried out on the electrodes of a commercial battery cell in order to measure the elastic modulus of coating materials and the elastic–plastic and fracture behavior of the electrodes. Additionally, interrupted tests were conducted on a polypropylene separator and its deformation at each stage was investigated under SEM. Samples with the same size were loaded to different strains and then fully unloaded. SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were subsequently used to analyze the changes in the microstructure such as crystal orientation and pore size. From these tests, it was found that cathode and anode coatings have distinct deformation mechanisms. The cathode develops a number of micro cracks on the surface before reaching final failure, while the anode maintains its integrity until later stages of deformation. The separator also shows unique stages of deformation such as elongation of fibrils and formation of new pores until reaching final onset of failure.</span></div></div>

Forty medication-naïve children with ADHD (mean age 8.1 years) were evaluated with the Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting-Manuscript, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC), the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) and the Conner Global Index. An important subset (85.0%) exhibited manual dexterity difficulties. Handwriting performance was extremely variable in terms of speed and legibility. VMI was the most important predictor of legibility. Upper extremity coordination, as measured by the M-ABC ball skills subtest, was also a good predictor of word legibility.

The objective of this study is to assess whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurement can distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects. Sixty patients with schizophrenia and sixty age- and gender-matched healthy controls were divided into two sequential groups. The concentration change in oxygenated hemoglobin (Δ[oxy-Hb]) was measured in the bilateral prefrontal areas (Fp1-F7 and Fp2-F8) during the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) letter version and category version, Tower of Hanoi (TOH), Sternberg's (SBT) and Stroop Tasks. In the first group, schizophrenia patients showed poorer task performance on all tasks and less prefrontal cortex activation during all but the Stroop Task compared to healthy subjects. In the second group, schizophrenia patients showed poorer task performance and less prefrontal cortex activation during VFTs and TOH tasks than healthy subjects. We then performed discriminant analysis by a stepwise method using Δ[oxy-Hb] and task performance measures as independent variables. The discriminant analysis in the first group included task performance of TOH, VFT letter and VFT category and Δ[oxy-Hb] of VFT letter. As a result, 88.3% of the participants were correctly classified as being schizophrenic or healthy subjects in the first analysis. The discriminant function derived from the first group correctly assigned 75% of the subjects in the second group. Our findings suggest that NIRS measurement could be applied to differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy subjects.</span></div></div>

The results have shown that the examined separator membranes, particularly those based on the PVdF co-polymers, are able to uptake large liquid amounts leading to high ionic conductivity values. Tests performed on Li/LiFePO4 and Li/Sn–C cells have revealed very good cycling performance even at high current rates and 100% of DOD, approaching the results achieved in liquid electrolytes. A capacity fading lower than 0.002% per cycle was observed. Particularly, the Li/LiFePO4 cathode cells have exhibited excellent rate capability, being still able to deliver at 2C above 89% of the capacity discharged at 0.1C.

For instance, the current rapid development of Electric Vehicles (EV) creates a strong demand for an accurate and reliable on-board SoH indicator during operation. Such an indicator is a key parameter required to optimize battery energy management and to track the degradation of the system performance. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of an electrochemical system is a powerful lab-based diagnostic technique, usually measured using a frequency response analyzer. In this paper, we present an innovative diagnostic technique based on analysis of free voltage and current signals to give a so called “quasi-electrochemical impedance spectrum” (QEIS) and demonstrate its application on a Li-ion battery during a real EV duty cycle. It is worth noting that in our technique no additional signal is applied to the cell, since the current flowing into cells during use on-board is directly processed in the data treatment step. Commercial batteries (1.4Ah cylindrical LiFePO4/graphite cell) were selected in this study to validate the diagnostic method in the framework of an applied case study related to an electric school bus demonstrator. In order to study the capability of QEIS measurements as a diagnostic tool for SoH of Li-ion cells, a test procedure including ageing phases has been defined to characterise Li-ion cells before and during ageing. Voltage and current signals were treated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to determine the QEIS spectra of Li-ion cells under study. Then, SoH prediction algorithms have been obtained from a mathematical analysis of the impedance parameters sensitive to SoH.</span></div></div>

The semiparametric methodology allows us to alleviate misspecification bias by combining multiple indicators into a latent construct in an unspecified, data-driven way. Using data from female participants of the 1974–2010 waves of the US General Social Survey, we find that education, intelligence, and maternal education contribute positively to multidimensional well-being.

The carbon nanostructures were deposited onto a bare gold disc electrode by a vapor deposition process. In the next step, the fullerene was electrochemically polymerized under cyclic voltammetric conditions. The obtained composites are electrochemically active at negative potentials due to the reduction of the fullerene moieties. The voltammetric response corresponding to this electrochemical process depends on the type of nanostructure and the amount of material deposited at the electrode surface. Such systems exhibit promising electrochemical properties. The highest capacitance of about 1000Fg−1, with respect to mass of polymer, was obtained for the SWCNTs/C60-Pd composite. This value is about four times higher compared to the capacitance of the polymer deposited on a bare gold electrode surface. Lower values of the specific capacitance were obtained for composites containing other MWCNTs and ox-CNOs. For the C60-Pd/ox-CNOs composites the highest values of the specific capacitance were found to be about 280Fg−1.</span></div></div>

Among the degradation mechanisms proposed in previous reports, those arising either from cation mixing or from the formation of oxygen-deficient spinels are negligible in these materials, but a certain amount of spinel dissolution is observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the spinel lattice experiences an appreciable change in volume during charge–discharge cycling. The extent of this change depends on the nature of dopant. Compared to the undoped spinel, the lattice expansion/contraction according to Li+ insertion/removal is more significant in the B-doped spinel, but it is smaller in the case of Ni-, Co-, Al-, or Li-doped spinels. Spinels experiencing a smaller volume change maintain their structural integrity, even after prolonged cell cycling, such that there is a better capacity retention. In the B-doped spinel, however, the spinel lattice is largely collapsed and new phases are formed after cell cycling. This results in poor cycleability. It is proposed that the structural breakdown due to the repeated change in lattice volume is the most important failure mode in these materials. Spinel dissolution plays a second major role.</span></div></div>
