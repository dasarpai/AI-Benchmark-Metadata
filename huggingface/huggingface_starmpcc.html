Summary:\n\nPatient: 60-year-old male with moderate ARDS from COVID-19\n\nHospital Course:\n\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. During physical therapy on the acute ward, the patient experienced coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea with any change of position or deep breathing. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, a step-by-step approach was used for position changes. The breathing exercises were adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation, and with close monitoring, the patient managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level. Exercise progression was low initially but increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\n\nClinical Outcome:\n\nThe patient was discharged on day 10 to a rehabilitation clinic making satisfactory progress with all symptoms resolved.\n\nFollow-up:\n\nThe patient will receive follow-up care at the rehabilitation clinic, with regular monitoring of progress and further rehabilitation exercises until full recovery. Any new symptoms or concerns should be reported to the clinic immediately.\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThe patient responded well to treatment, and with appropriate medical intervention, was able to overcome the difficulties faced during hospitalization for ARDS from COVID-19. The patient's level of care was of a high standard, with all necessary therapy provided and monitoring of progress before discharge.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Can you provide a simplified paraphrase of the sentence, 'To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, a step-by-step approach was used for position changes' in the patient's discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The healthcare team used a gradual approach to changing the patient's position to avoid worsening of the respiratory status and prevent respiratory failure.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Paraphrasing&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;patient_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discharge Summary:\n\nAdmission Date: [Insert Date]\nDischarge Date: [Insert Date]\n\nPatient Name: [Insert Name]\nAge/Sex: 39-year-old Male\nMedical Record Number: [Insert Number]\n\nAdmission Diagnosis: Unspecified respiratory tract infection\nDischarge Diagnosis: Resolved respiratory tract infection\n\nHospital Course: The patient was hospitalized due to persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks, leading to reduced general health condition. On admission, the patient required 4 L/min of oxygen due to rapid shallow breathing at rest and severe breathlessness during minor physical activity. The initial physical therapy focused on educating the patient on dyspnea-relieving positions, mobilization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises. However, with time, the patient's anxiety-induced dyspnea became an issue, leading to the modification of therapy to relieve his dyspnea.\n\nThe patient positively responded to the therapy, evidenced by a reduction in respiratory rate from 30 to 22 breaths/min and an increase in oxygen saturation from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen. Over the next few days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate gradually, and the patient regained his self-confidence. The therapy was eventually shifted to walking and strength training, and the patient was able to walk for 350m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before discharge.\n\nHospital Outcome: The patient was discharged home in an improved condition, with resolved respiratory tract infection, showing no need for further hospitalization. The patient was advised to follow-up with his regular healthcare professional for further monitoring and management of his health status.\n\nDischarge Medications: None\n\nFollow-up: The patient was advised to follow-up with his regular healthcare professional regarding further monitoring and management of his health status. \n\nImpression: Resolved respiratory tract infection with successful physical therapy for dyspnea relief and anxiety reduction. The patient responded well to therapy and regained his self-confidence, able to walk independently before discharge.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Which coreferences were resolved in the hospital course section related to the patient's respiratory tract infection?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The hospital course section resolved the coreferences related to the patient's respiratory tract infection by providing information on the initial physical therapy, which focused on dyspnea-relieving positions, mobilization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises, and the modified therapy that targeted the patient's anxiety-induced dyspnea.

Physical therapy was initiated promptly after admission, which helped improve the patient's breathing frequency and oxygen saturation. The patient was guided to achieve a prone position resulting in a significant increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. The patient continued to receive intensive physical therapy, positioning, and oxygen therapy for the next few days. Although there were challenges in achieving the prone position due to the patient's profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and high risk of symptom exacerbation, the medical team succeeded in implementing a safe and individualized approach.\n\nAfter three days with this regime, the patient was transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists continued his rehabilitation, including walking and strength training. However, the patient's severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, after nine days from ICU admission, the patient was successfully discharged from the hospital as a pedestrian.\n\nDischarge Condition:\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient's medical condition had significantly improved, and he was considered stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The patient's oxygen saturation had returned to normal limits, and his breathing frequency had decreased significantly.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis course summary demonstrates that the patient responded positively to a physical therapy treatment regimen, including positioning, deep-breathing exercises, and walking. Although the patient's medical condition was quite severe during the initial ICU admission, his rehabilitation resulted in marked improvement, leading to a successful discharge from the hospital.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What were the key improvements in the patient's medical condition during the hospital course, and how was physical therapy utilized to achieve these results?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;During the hospital course, the patient's medical condition improved significantly, with his breathing frequency decreasing and oxygen saturation returning to normal limits.

Initially, he was given lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, and he remained stable. However, his condition worsened over the next days, and he developed hemodynamic instability and severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy because of these complications. Physical therapists were involved in this process, and they were responsible for ensuring the correct positioning of the patient's joints and preventing secondary complications, such as pressure ulcers, nerve lesions and contractures.\nAfter the tracheostomy, the patient underwent passive range-of-motion exercises and passive side-edge mobilization. However, asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability persisted, inhibiting active participation. After spending 24 days in the ICU, the patient showed severe signs of muscle loss and scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx). The patient died soon after the withdrawal of life support.\n\nHospital Stay:\nThe patient was in the ICU for 24 days, where he received treatment interventions, including passive range of motion and positioning, intermittent prone positioning, and continuous renal replacement therapy. While in the ICU, the patient showed severe signs of muscle loss and developed pressure ulcer on the forehead.\n\nDischarge Instruction:\nThe patient has been discharged in a stable condition.

One day later, he was diagnosed with pneumonia that progressed into moderate ARDS and required mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, the patient experienced disorientation and an inability to communicate verbally due to global weakness (CPAx 11/50), accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Specialized physical therapy with the Gugging Swallowing Screen confirmed severe dysphagia, with the patient showing insufficient protection against aspiration. Treatment included therapy for dysphagia, such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and protection mechanism training, while receiving no food or drink by mouth. Over the next few days, the patient was able to swallow pureÃ©d food and mildly thick liquids under supervision, although cough strength remained weak. The patient progressed gradually and became capable of independent food ingestion before discharge.\n\nDischarge:\nThe patient was discharged 25 days after admission to a rehabilitation clinic. The patient's respiratory condition stabilized, although dysphagia was still evident, with mild oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that continued to compromise paresthesia and needed ongoing regular oral care.

After being diagnosed, the patient was treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning. On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, resulting in a significant increase in the patient's level of consciousness and collaborative state. The patient's muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60. Despite the weakness, she was continuously encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity, and she was actively transferred to a chair each day. After successful extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia, which was closely monitored for secretion management and cough stimulation. Physical rehabilitation was continued, and the patient started walking with a walking aid on day 19. Her oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident at this point, and after 25 days, she was transferred to the institution's rehabilitation facilities where she received further treatment.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n\n- Moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance\n- Postextubation dysphagia\n- ICU-acquired weakness\n- Persistent physical function impairment\n\nPROCEDURES:\n\n- Immediate tracheal intubation\n- Sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) trial\n- Continuous physical therapy\n- Successful extubation\n- Close monitoring for secretion management and cough stimulation\n- Walking with a walking aid\n\nSUMMARY OF CARE:\n\nThis document serves as a summary of the hospital course of a 59-year-old female admitted due to dyspnea and diagnosed with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance.

Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a highly suggestive malignant breast mass, which was confirmed by a biopsy of the dominant lesion. The patient underwent a right breast simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation and her pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. She received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data, ovarian suppression was recommended to be considered as the patient had high-risk features. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression, the patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. Given the high-risk disease, the benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone was discussed, and the patient was hesitant about oophorectomy. She was started on triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days.\n\nSummary of Findings:\nThe patient is a premenopausal woman with a family history of cancers who was diagnosed with a highly suggestive malignant breast mass.

The computed tomography (CT) scan showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC that extended from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Due to the patientâ€™s history of advanced cirrhosis and large esophageal varices, anticoagulation was not an option. Palliative stenting of the IVC was performed to relieve the patientâ€™s pain and improve his quality of life.\n\nProcedure:\nRight internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. Initial attempts to cross the 100% occluded IVC with a Glidewire Advantage were unsuccessful. The IVC was successfully crossed with a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter. A multipurpose catheter was then advanced into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was replaced with a Glidewire Advantage. A 9 Ã— 80 Mustang balloon and then a 22 Ã— 70 mm Wallstent were used to perform IVC ballooning. Finally, an 18 Ã— 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was used to post-dilate the stent. Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare.\n\nCondition on Discharge:\nN/A\n\nInstructions at Discharge:\nN/A\n\nFollow-up Recommendations:\nN/A&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What coreferential expressions require resolution in the hospital course section related to the patient's diagnosis of an occlusive thrombus of the IVC and portal vein?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The coreferential expressions that require resolution in the hospital course section are the location of the thrombus, which extended from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction, and the presence of thrombus in the portal vein.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Coreference Resolution&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;patient_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:15,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;15&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient: 45-year-old woman with a medical history of type II diabetes and primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nHospital Course:\n\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in 2006, which was treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

She had a history of childhood trauma resulting in nasal septum deviation and external nasal deformity. Four months after a successful septorhinoplasty, she presented to the emergency department with blunt nasal trauma resulting in a septal hematoma, which was drained successfully; the patient was discharged with no adverse sequelae.\n\nFour months later, the patient sustained nasal trauma again, resulting in clear nasal discharge, raising suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was discharged from the hospital after managing the nasal injury, as the CT brain showed an intact cribriform plate with no evidence of a CSF leak. Ten days later, she presented at the emergency department with dizziness and an unstable gait.\n\nFindings:\n\nThe patient presented with additional symptoms such as paresthesia, starting in her right hand and progressing to the right shoulder, arm, and leg, and some difficulty in executing movements in the first and second finger of her right hand. She also had stiffness in her right leg and difficulty walking. On close inquiry, she gave a history of pain in the right eye and double vision many months earlier, which had resolved spontaneously. Examination showed a positive Rombergâ€™s and Lhermitteâ€™s sign, with right-sided sensory impairment.\n\nDiagnosis And Treatment:\n\nMRI of the brain, cervical, and thoracic spine demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the brain and cervical segment of the spinal cord. Some of the lesions showed enhancement on post gadolinium administration sequences, suggestive of active demyelinating diseases like MS. A lumbar puncture was performed revealing the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. The diagnosis of MS was confirmed by a neurologist, and treatment was initiated.\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe initial neurological symptoms have largely vanished, with only persistent light paresthesia in the right hand.

She also had constipation and urinary incontinence. A workup was initiated for an occult malignancy due to diffuse osteosclerotic lesions in visualized bones. CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary lesions but several subcutaneous lesions on the back. MRI of the brain and spine showed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brainstem extending along the entire spinal cord. Lumbar puncture showed increased protein and white blood cells in cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis. Finally, a right iliac bone biopsy was done that revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast.\n\nTreatment:\n\nThe patient was started on letrozole initially with dexamethasone taper, followed by palliative radiation therapy with 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the lumbosacral spine which improved her lower back pain. After completion of the radiation therapy, abemaciclib was added to letrozole as the systemic therapy and she showed excellent response to the treatment. She does continue to have sclerotic changes in her bones; however, she deferred from bone-targeted therapy.\n\nFollow-up:\n\nThe patient has been on abemaciclib and letrozole for about two years, her neurological symptoms have improved, and now she has a good quality of life.

She was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs, which progressed rapidly to quadriplegia. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She was diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) due to idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination. The patient was treated with sodium correction and pulse methylprednisolone and discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.\n\nOne year later, the patient presented to the neurology department with generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs, which made her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Clinical examination revealed pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. The patient was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities. Basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia, and arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive for anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies, and minor salivary gland biopsy was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation and subsequently shifted to oral liquid formulation. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone and referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.\n\nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n\nFollow-Up Appointments:\nThe patient was referred to a rheumatologist for further management.\n\nInstructions:\nThe patient should follow-up with her rheumatologist. The patient should continue taking oral potassium and sodium bicarbonate as prescribed. The patient should maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n1.

Primary Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition that affects the glands that make saliva and tears. In this case, it caused renal tubular acidosis (a kidney problem that causes an imbalance of acid in the body) and hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which led to weakness in all four limbs. The patient received treatment for their potassium deficiency and acidosis, as well as medication to manage their autoimmune condition. They will need to follow up with their rheumatologist and continue taking their prescribed medication to maintain proper electrolyte balance and manage their condition.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Paraphrasing&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;patient_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:29,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;29&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient Name: [REDACTED]\nDOB: [REDACTED]\nSex: Female\nAdmission Date: [REDACTED]\nDischarge Date: [REDACTED]\n\nReason for Admission:\nThe patient was admitted with shortness of breath, cough, myalgias, and malaise in the setting of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.\n\nHospital Course:\nUpon admission, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, dexamethasone, furosemide, azithromycin, and enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

The patient had a history of similar episodes in the past four years but was not diagnosed with any medical condition. Physical examination revealed mild to moderate tenderness in the right hip joint and a decreased range of motion. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits, and X-rays of the pelvis and right thigh were unremarkable. However, an MRI of the right thigh showed trochanteric bursa effusion and synovitis of the right hip joint. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol were started for management, and the patient showed excellent improvement in the first three months.\n\nFour months later, the patient complained of swelling in the right sternoclavicular joint. Laboratory investigations were normal, but MRI showed a patchy area of hyperintensity on T2 and hypointensity on T1 images close to the sternoclavicular junction. On post-contrast images, there was a mild accentuated heterogeneous enhancement. A trace of fluid was also noted in the joint space, and marrow edema was seen along the articular margin and body of the sternum. Imaging data and clinical history were indicative of SAPHO syndrome, and the patient was started on paracetamol and NSAIDs. At the one-month follow-up, the swelling had improved, and the patient was continued on the therapy which significantly resolved symptoms within three months.\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe condition of the patient significantly improved with treatment, and there were no further signs of recurrence. The patient was informed of lifestyle modifications to manage pain and inflammation, including maintaining physical fitness, minimizing joint strain, and adopting an anti-inflammatory diet.

Examination revealed a well-looking girl, vitally stable, with normal blood pressure. The patient had no vaginal bleeding, no pubic or axillary hair, and her Tanner staging was A1, P1, and B3. A bone age of 8 years was discovered through a left wrist X-ray. Hormonal evaluation showed elevated levels of estradiol E2 and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate with normal early morning cortisol level. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a right-sided hypoechoic suprarenal mass, and an abdominal CT scan showed a well-defined rounded focal lesion with no evidence of local tissue invasion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of a central cause of precocious puberty. A diagnosis of an estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor was made, and the patient underwent laparotomy during which a 3 cm diameter tumor in the right adrenal gland was excised. The histopathological examination revealed a benign adrenal cortical adenoma. The postoperative evaluation revealed normal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and the patient was started on monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist.\n\nDiagnosis:\n1. Estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor\n2. Precocious puberty\n3. Benign adrenal cortical adenoma\n\nPlan:\n1. Monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist\n2.

IHC and histopathologic observations confirmed the diagnosis of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. A 733-gene NGS panel indicated the presence of an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. NGS-based CNV analyses showed the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion, which are associated with secondary MDS. The physiological blood indexes and bone marrow aspiration test confirmed MDS.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was administered with gefitinib for the EGFR-positive mutation and azacitidine for four courses of treatment due to decreasing platelet counts. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and maximal tumor size did not decrease after seven monthsâ€™ treatment. Due to infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells in the fibrous tissue, the patient was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor with small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounting for about 40% and 60%, respectively. Positive PD-L1 expression and high TMB in the tissue sample led to the administration of toripalimab and bevacizumab. The patient's platelet counts gradually returned to near-normal levels, and the tumor lesion shrunk obviously. \n\nDischarge Plan:\nN/A.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What specific medical entities and treatments can the Named Entity Recognition identify in this discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Named Entity Recognition can identify the following medical entities and treatments in this discharge summary: \n- Medical entities: malignant tumor, distal obstructive inflammation, left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, bone metastases, lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation, TP53 p.H179L germline mutation, whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion, MDS, neuroendocrine tumor with small cell carcinoma, atypical carcinoid tumor, PD-L1 expression, high TMB. \n- Treatments: gefitinib, azacitidine, toripalimab, bevacizumab.

He had features of septicemia and blood investigations revealed low hemoglobin, raise leukocyte count, low albumin, raised serum creatinine, serum urea, and low sodium. He was managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and underwent multiple aggressive debridements of the neck and chest wall due to acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. After three weeks of anti-tubercular chemotherapy, a split-thickness graft was applied in multiple fractions and the patient was followed up for six months in good clinical condition after discharge.\nDischarge Instructions:\nThe patient is advised to avoid direct sun exposure and to keep the wound clean and dry. He is also advised to complete the full course of anti-tubercular chemotherapy as prescribed by the treating physician.

Her right hip had been more painful than her left hip.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\nThe patient had a history of iron-deficiency anemia that was diagnosed 2 years earlier. She had been treated with iron supplements but had not experienced any fracture episodes or other complications.\n\nHospital Course:\n\nDuring the hospital course, the patient underwent standard radiographs of both hips, which revealed no characteristic findings. MRI scans showed a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head, and a high signal region in all of the femoral head. DEXA values were low in both femoral necks.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified as stage 1 in both femoral heads, as per the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification. She was instructed to avoid bearing weight on the right side, which led to immediate symptom improvement.\n\nHowever, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly. Radiographic findings showed almost no change, but a slight signal change was observed in the medial subcapital region in the MRI scan. Her pain continued to worsen, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips, and MRI scans showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on both femoral necks.\n\nFurther examination revealed low DEXA values, an increase in TRACP-5b level, and a decrease in total P1NP; the patient was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. The fractures were stabilized by surgery with the use of sliding hip screws, and the femoral heads were decompressed. Eldecalcitol and teriparatide acetate were administered, and the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally.\n\nDischarge Plan:\n\nThe patient was discharged with close follow-up and instructions to continue the prescribed medications. Her walking ability improved gradually, and her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hips at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis. The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend regular follow-up visits.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the relationship between the patient's bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and the decrease in JOA hip score and the nondisplaced subcapital fracture on both femoral necks as seen in the MRI scans? (related to Relation Extraction)&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head led to the decrease in JOA hip score and the nondisplaced subcapital fracture on both femoral necks as seen in the MRI scans. The osteonecrosis weakened the bones, making the patient more prone to fractures and decreasing their hip score. Additionally, the patient's underlying vitamin D deficiency may have contributed to the development of both osteonecrosis and fractures.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Relation Extraction&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;patient_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:42,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;42&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient Name: [REDACTED]\n\nDate of Admission: [REDACTED]\n\nDate of Discharge: [REDACTED]\n\nHospital Course:\n\nThe 14-year-old male adolescent was admitted to the emergency department due to subfebrile temperatures and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa. Prior to these symptoms, the patient had been immobilized following a minor sports injury. The patient's medical history revealed an asymptomatic antithrombin deficiency (ATD) diagnosed 8 years ago and a maternal history of ATD. No other hereditary thrombophilic disorders were detected. The patient's blood analysis indicated elevated levels of D-dimers and C-reactive protein (CrP), and reduced antithrombin activity. The vascular ultrasound confirmed thrombosis of the right lower extremity. The patient received continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban. Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated.\n\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed complete deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, and extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. It also revealed occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals suggestive of IVC associated with ATD. Catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was initiated in both extremities. Anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon. The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission.\n\nA follow-up examination showed extended re-thrombosis of both pelvic axes and the right lower extremity, leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy. Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, but the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic. The patient's oral anticoagulation was intensified to prevent re-thrombosis. Regular follow-up examinations at the outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date.\n\nThe patient was discharged on day seven after admission. The left iliac vessels remain thrombotic, but the IVC was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting. The patientâ€™s mother was also found to have recanalized IVC upon angiography intervention.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n\n1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, left lower extremity, both iliac vessels, and inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD).\n\n2. Recanalized IVC and thrombotic left iliac vessels.\n\n3. IVCA.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon should be continued lifelong to prevent thrombosis due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD.\n\n2. Follow-up examinations should be done regularly at the outpatient clinic.\n\n3. The patient and their family should be counseled on the importance of continued medical management for ATD.\n\n4. More interventions should be done for thrombotic lesions found in pelvic vessels. \n\nSigned, \n\n[Doctor's Name] \n\n[Specialty]&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What was the patient's diagnosis and treatment plan for multiple thrombotic events associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD) according to the discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, left lower extremity, both iliac vessels, and inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD). The treatment plan involved catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), followed by anticoagulative therapy with vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon. To prevent re-thrombosis, oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon should be continued lifelong and regular follow-up examinations should be done at the outpatient clinic. The patient and their family should be counseled on the importance of continued medical management for ATD. While interventions were done for thrombotic lesions in the right lower extremity and pelvic axis, the left iliac vessels remained thrombotic and required further interventions.

The patient was appropriately managed with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy and WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which offered partial relief of symptoms.\n\nHowever, in March 2021, the patient reapplied with similar symptoms and was recommended radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with TrueBeamÂ® (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) LINAC. All necessary preparations were done; treatment simulation was done on the CT images with SPACE sequence and GTV and PTV were defined accordingly.\n\nDosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System), and dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals, as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines.\n\nBefore treatment, the patient was given a 16mg intramuscular depot dexamethasone injection to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to significant edema from the cerebellar metastasis. The effective time of treatment was of four minutes.\n\nOutcome and Discharge: Follow-up was programmed 15 days after the treatment, at which the patient presented clinically significant improvement, including absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait. There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. \n\nDuring the follow-up MRI on July 17, 2021, the patient showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass.

The patient had been diagnosed with GAD at a local mental health center and was prescribed paroxetine, tandospirone, and oxazepam prior to admission, which had initially improved her symptoms.\n\nUpon physical examination, the patient had normal limb muscle strength and tone, but her gait was not stable and she took small steps. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously and had reported no other comorbidities.\n\nLab testing revealed that the patient had subclinical hypothyroidism with diffused thyroid lesions and nodular changes as well as anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Imaging of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis, while EEG recordings revealed diffuse slow waves. Based on her symptoms of rapidly progressive dementia and psychomotor retardation, and negative imaging and lab findings, the patient was suspected to have a paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\nHowever, lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed and showed a high anti-glutamate receptor (NMDA) ratio, leading to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was transferred to the neurology department and treated with immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. After treatment, the patient showed gradual improvement in cognitive and emotional function and was discharged 24 days after admission without relapse at a 6-month follow-up.\n\nHospital Diagnoses:\n1.

The patient was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions. The patient was treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement.\n\nThe patient presented with a worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles. A skin biopsy showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163.\n\nAfter considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam.\n\nThe disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission.\n\nSix months after the end of maintenance therapy the patient had a recurrence of the disease and started second-line chemotherapy with clofarabine and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The patient did not comply with the treatment and the disease progressed. As a result of skin ulceration, she developed skin and soft tissue infection that evolved into septic shock and did not survive despite intensive care support.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What was the treatment plan for the patient's multi-system process, and how effective was it in achieving remission?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's multi-system process was treated with induction treatment of prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy, resulting in partial regression of skin lesions and resolution of urothelium lesion in imaging exam at six weeks.

He was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases on evaluation with PET-CT scan of the whole body. The patient underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing and palliative external beam radiotherapy for the pathological fracture. He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019. An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response.\n\nAfter 10 cycles of immunotherapy, the patient discontinued Inj. pembrolizumab due to personal reasons and was started on chemotherapy, Inj. pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and Inj. bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019. The patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively. The patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy.\n\nThe patient was readmitted in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness. On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site. Palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered. In June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases. The patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks. The patient's condition further deteriorated, and in July, he succumbed to disease progression.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe patient, a 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases. The patient underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing and palliative external beam radiotherapy for the pathological fracture. The patient received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019.

On admission, the patient presented with left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8/15, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 26. A head CT was performed, which showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with the patient's age. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, but the patient's GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. A repeat head CT showed no acute findings. The patient's condition was monitored conservatively to prevent further deterioration.\n\nOver the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent. When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands. The patient had limited rehabilitation potential, with fatigue limiting conversations and poor engagement during therapy sessions. A third head CT several days after admission confirmed a bilateral thalamic infarct, with small left parietal cortical infarction. Imaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP).\n\nThe patient participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation sessions over the next month and had a gradual return of physical function. He was unable to care for himself independently and was eventually discharged to a care home.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n\nStroke with bilateral thalamic infarcts and small left parietal cortical infarction.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n\nThe patient's current medications were not listed in the case report.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n\nThe patient was discharged to a care home, where he would receive ongoing care.\n\nFollow-up:\n\nThe patient passed away one year after the initial presentation to the hospital from an intercurrent chest infection.

The patient was diagnosed with SÃ©zary Syndrome, Stage IVA. Subsequently, several therapies were attempted, including an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV), which led to an improvement of skin lesions. However, an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) was ultimately performed due to persistent disease. The transplant initially showed residual infiltration of SÃ©zary Syndrome cells but ultimately led to complete hematological remission. The patient developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the ocular mucosa and the liver after discontinuation of immunosuppression. The patient required immunosuppressive treatment but is now in continuous complete remission of SÃ©zary Syndrome.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n1. SÃ©zary Syndrome, Stage IVA\n2.

He was diagnosed with acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema and underwent an external ventricular drain insertion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered, and the patient was classified as probable TB. A standard anti-TB regimen was initiated, and the patient's condition improved after 14 days. He was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay. One month later, he presented again with vomiting, unsteady gait, and anorexia. A follow-up MRI revealed an exuberant nodular leptomeningeal enhancement that was more extensive than the initial study. Histopathological examination revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation, and the patient was diagnosed with DL-GNT. The parents opted for palliative treatment.\n\nSummary of Findings:\n\nThe patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9 and left lateral strabismus. The pupils were unequal (4 mm/3 mm) and sluggish. Power in all four limbs was 4/5 with normal reflexes. Babinski was downgoing, and Kernig's sign was not elicited. Non-contrast CT brain showed acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema, while MRI brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered based on high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and elevated CSF protein with normal CSF glucose levels. Histopathological examination revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation, and the patient was diagnosed with DL-GNT. \n\nTreatment:\n\nThe patient was administered a standard anti-TB regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. Intravenous dexamethasone was prescribed during the first 2 weeks of admission and was subsequently changed to oral administration.\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe patient's condition improved considerably after 14 days, and he was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay.

Physical examination revealed fatigue and depressions in suprasternal fossa, supraclavicular fossa, and intercostal space. The patient developed hypoxemia, and her right lung showed diminished breath sounds. Routine blood tests showed high C-reactive protein levels. Pulmonary CT suggested consolidation with atelectasis in the middle lobe of the right lung. Electrocardiogram indicated sinus rhythm. The patient received antimicrobial therapy on admission.\n\nOn the 2nd day, the first fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) was performed to relieve atelectasis and obtain respiratory samples for bacteriologic, cytologic, and histologic detection. On the 3rd day, azithromycin and methylprednisolone were applied for anti-inflammation. The titer of MP-immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 1:160. On the 5th day, due to persistent fever, and lesions on chest radiography progressed after conventional anti-infective therapy, the second FB was performed, and plastic bronchitis in the airwaywas found. MP-DNA was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). MP resistance mutation site 2063/2064 showed positive. The patient was discharged on the 17th day.\n\nOn the 24th day, the patient developed a sudden high fever. On the 30th day, there was a significant improvement observed in chest X-ray. The third FB was used on 27th day, and bronchial casts were removed. The patient did not present any discomfort within 60 days.\n\nDischarge Condition:\n\nThe patient's fever resolved, and the clinical symptoms and imaging improved. The patient was discharged in stable condition.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n\nNo medications were prescribed at discharge.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n\nFollow up with the primary care provider within a week for a clinical evaluation.

She received ventilatory support with a reservoir mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute due to pulmonary CT findings showing inflammatory consolidation with atelectasis. The initial fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) was performed to determine the etiology of the symptoms. Despite treatment with cephalothin and azithromycin, the patient's fever, cough, and hypoxemia persisted. The arterial blood gas values showed a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mm Hg, PaO2 of 52 mmHg, and oxygenation index of 247. The patient was started on nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and methylprednisolone was administered for anti-inflammation. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a temperature of 38.3Â°C, heart rate of 135 beats/minute, respiration rate of 45 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg, fatigue, flaring of nares, and decreased respiratory sounds in the left lung.\n\nDiagnostic Findings:\n\nCardiovascular, neurological, and extremity exams were normal. The ANA and ENA laboratory studies were also normal. Routine blood tests showed Hb 118g/L, WBC 6.25x109/L, N 55.3%, L 37.6%, and CRP 26mg/L. On day 4, pulmonary CT demonstrated inflammatory consolidation with left pleural effusion. The fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed fibrinoid formation in the left upper and lower lobes, consistent with plastic bronchitis. The BAL fluid test did not reveal any other etiology aside from the presence of MP-DNA and Epstein Barr (EB)-DNA up to 1x108 copies/mL and 4.8x105 copies/mL, respectively. Hypokalemia (K 3.28mmol/L) and coagulation abnormalities were also present during disease presentation.\n\nTreatment:\n\nThe patient subsequently received a second fiberoptic bronchoscopy to relieve bronchial casts in response to increased patchy shadow shown on chest radiography on day 5. The patient received methylprednisolone at a dose of 10mg/kg/day and gamma globulin at 2g/kg. The methylprednisolone was continued for a total of 11 days, and medical management resulted in an improved fever, lower oxygen demand, and resolution of anoxia by day 6 of treatment. The patient was discharged on the 12th day due to clinical improvement, and follow-up MP-IgM titer demonstrated an eight-fold increase on the 14th day. Cough persisted on the 18th day.

Clinical examination at our institution was postponed due to quarantine of the owners.\n\nHospital Course Summary:\nUpon presentation, LV volume overload and global systolic dysfunction without left atrial dilation were discovered. Mild mitral regurgitation with central jet was present due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype. Routine blood work, including a thyroid profile, and assessment of the serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were unremarkable. Initial serological tests for infections responsible for MI were performed and showed negative results. Upon the discovery of a positive COVID-19 result, additional serological tests were performed, and all results were positive. Exercise restriction was recommended, and pimobendan was prescribed. An improvement in exercise tolerance was reported with no further syncopal episodes. \n\nAt the final examination, heart murmurs were detected, but LV systolic function had mildly improved. All serological assays were still positive, and cTnI was elevated but nearing the HRI. The patient was discharged with a prescription for pimobendan. \n\nFollow-up Care:\nThe patient is currently alive and healthy, with regular echocardiographic examinations.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What abbreviations related to the patient's cardiac diagnosis and treatment require expansion in the given discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The abbreviation \&quot;DCM\&quot; requires expansion in the given discharge summary. \&quot;cTnI\&quot; can be expanded as \&quot;cardiac troponin I.\&quot; No other abbreviations related to the patient's cardiac diagnosis and treatment require expansion in the given discharge summary.&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Abbreviation Expansion&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:64,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;patient_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:69,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;69&quot;},&quot;note&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient Information:\nAge: 11 months\nGender: Female\nBreed: Brown\nDiagnosis: Bovine viral diarrhea virus persistent infection (BVDV-PI)\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient, an 11-month-old female PI calf, was admitted to the Veterinary Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy on 12 April 2021 for diagnostic confirmation of BVDV PI. The calf had been identified in a herd of Apulia region, Italy, that consisted of 99 Alpine Brown cattle, all under the age of 1 year. The patient had undergone virological and bacteriological investigations before arrival, which revealed the presence of BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Upon arrival, the patient was hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Unit and clinically examined two times a day during the entire period of hospitalization. The patient was kept in a separate room with straw bedding, was fed a commercial concentrate twice daily, and had access to haylage and water ad libitum. The facility was closed for other animals and had restricted admission for people. Two days after arrival, the patient showed hyperthermia (39.8 Â°C), and additional samples were collected to monitor its health status and to assess the presence of concomitant virological/bacteriological infections.\n\nDiagnostic Findings:\nThe presence of BVDV and BCoV was confirmed in nasal swabs, fecal swabs, and EDTA-treated blood collected from the patient, and BVDV antibodies were detected in serum samples.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient did not receive any specific treatment for BVDV-PI during hospitalization.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nThe patient was observed for 60 days, during which stool samples, nasal swabs, serum samples, and EDTA-treated blood were collected weekly until BCoV tests were negative.

He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, which was well-controlled with ACE inhibitors. He had been receiving oral anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran and antiarrhythmic therapy for the past few years, but his arrhythmic episodes persisted and required multiple admissions to the emergency room. After a thorough assessment, we proposed atrial fibrillation ablation to the patient.\n\nPROCEDURE:\nWe performed bipolar mapping of the right atrium with the ThermoCool SmartTouch SF ablation catheter. The inferior and superior vena cava, and coronary sinus were delineated, and the His potential was tagged in yellow. The interatrial septum was carefully reconstructed, and the Fossa ovalis was precisely defined by setting the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25-0.75 mV and tagging all the fragmented and low voltage signals in light blue. The FO location was further confirmed by ICE and the CartoSound module. We also assessed and reconstructed the structures of the left atrium using ICE and the CartoSound module. A single transseptal puncture was performed using the VIZIGO sheath and transseptal needle. The ThermoCool SmartTouch SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO sheath into the left atrium to perform anatomical mapping and PVI, following the CLOSE protocol. Ablations were performed with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. The entire procedure lasted 100 minutes, and there were no complications.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:\nAt discharge, the patient had no more symptoms and did not report any arrhythmic recurrences. He was not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs and was on apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\nThe patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presented no more symptoms, has not had any recurrences of AF, and was compliant with his medication.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\nThe patient was advised to continue with apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control. He was advised to contact us if he experienced any new cardiac symptoms, such as palpitations or shortness of breath. The patient should also schedule a regular follow-up visit with his primary care physician to monitor his blood pressure and cardiac function.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThis discharge summary covers only the patient's hospital course and does not include any outside information or additional diagnoses.

Upon admission, the patient underwent an echocardiogram that did not show any pathological features. Oral anticoagulation with Dabigatran was started, and after four weeks of therapy, electrical cardioversion was performed with effectiveness in restoring sinus rhythm. An antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was also initiated. During a cardiological visit five years later, it was discovered that the patient had a recurrence of the arrhythmia and mentioned reduction in daily normal activity due to asthenia. An echocardiography exam showed a left atrial indexed volume of 36 mL/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%. AF ablation through pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was proposed.\n\nHospital Course Summary:\n\n- Long history of persistent atrial fibrillation\n- Echocardiogram did not show any pathological features\n- Oral anticoagulation with Dabigatran was started\n- Electrical cardioversion was performed with effectiveness in restoring sinus rhythm\n- An antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was initiated\n- Recurrence of arrhythmia was discovered during a cardiological visit five years later\n- Asthenia was reported by the patient\n- Echocardiography exam showed a left atrial indexed volume of 36 mL/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%\n- AF ablation through PVI was proposed.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the relation between the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation, electrical cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily, as described in the discharge summary through relation extraction?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Based on the discharge summary, the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation was treated with electrical cardioversion, and an antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was initiated to prevent future recurrence.

The symptoms had started at home four days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. The laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, AST 150 UI/L, and ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission, and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein. On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF spectrometry.\n\nHospital Course: The patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations. A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierreâ€™s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The source control includes an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. The patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and required mechanical ventilation. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole was added to piperacillin/tazobactam. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin. There was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved. Despite the adequate mean arterial pressure, there was a new worsening of the clinical status featured anemia without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring showed a hyperdynamic septic state. Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, hydrocortisone was added to argipressin and norepinephrine, leading to paramount hemodynamic improvement. Continuous hemofiltration was carried out to treat the inflammatory response by four cycles. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia monitoring and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion, and a new CT showed a persistence of known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program.\n\nCondition on Discharge: Good health condition\n\nPlan and Follow-Up: The patient was discharged to the rehabilitation care unit to continue the antibiotics therapy and rehabilitation program. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after three months, which demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What was the multimodal approach involved in managing the patient's Lemierre's septic syndrome in the Intensive Care Unit, as mentioned in the discharge summary using relation extraction?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The multimodal approach involved in managing the patient's Lemierre's septic syndrome in the Intensive Care Unit included source control with an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection, antibiotic therapy with the addition of metronidazole to piperacillin/tazobactam, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support with the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

An excisional biopsy was performed, which revealed a pigmented lesion with rare mitotic figures and multiple microscopic satellites, extending into fat to a depth of at least 4 mm. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for neoplasm.\n\nIMAGING AND LAB RESULTS:\n\nImmunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45 were diffusely reactive and -catenin showed non-specific cytoplasmic staining. Ki-67 demonstrated a low proliferative index. Four-color in situ hybridization and fusion analysis for 104 using targeted RNA sequencing related genes did not reveal any gene rearrangements including PRKCA and PRKAR1A. Targeted mutation analysis for over 50 cancer-related genes showed GNA11 c.626A>T p.Q209L oncogenic mutation. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) cluster analysis were performed as described above.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nThe patient is advised to follow up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and management of the pigmented lesion. Methylation profiling of tumors offers highly efficient and reliable information for classification of tumors and future studies aiming to explore the optimal use of this technique will warrant improved diagnostic and management approaches for pigmented lesions when there is a concern for malignancy.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nPigmented lesion with rare mitotic figures and multiple microscopic satellites.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What coreference resolution is required to understand the diagnosis and management of the pigmented lesion in the given discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The healthcare provider instructed the patient to follow up with further evaluation and management of the pigmented lesion.

She was later transferred to a tertiary care hospital for kinetic therapy and continuous renal replacement therapy due to oliguric acute kidney injury. Venovenous ECMO therapy was initiated due to progressive hypoxemia. The patient's nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. After tracheotomy and weaning, ECMO therapy and invasive assisted ventilation were no longer required, but the patient still needed intermittent renal replacement therapy.\n\nDuring the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before the clinical appearance of jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels, but sustained synthetic liver function reflected by international normalized ratio (INR) and serum albumin measurements. A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by ERCP, showing intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts. In addition, the patient received drugs that have previously been associated with SSC. Plasma levels of bilirubin and ammonia gradually increased after that, with stable liver synthesis reflected by normal values of the INR without substituting coagulation factors.\n\nThe patient developed progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion as the disease progressed. Hepatic encephalopathy was treated but clinical symptoms worsened. Hemadsorption using the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device was used in combination with IRRT to eliminate bilirubin, ammonia, and CRP levels while serum albumin levels remained stable. Direct comparison revealed that bilirubin was less efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption compared to ammonia. During the successful elimination of bilirubin and ammonia, clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved. Following a continuation of IRRT but termination of hemadsorption therapy, bilirubin and ammonia levels increased again, worsening clinical symptoms within 20 days. The patient suddenly died due to cardiac arrhythmia before liver transplantation evaluation was initiated. \n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n\nThe patient passed away due to cardiac arrhythmia. \n\nDischarge Condition:\n\nDeceased. \n\nFollow-up:\n\nThe patient requires no further follow-up. \n\nAttending Physician:\n\nThe attending physician was not named in the case report.&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the relationship between the patient's diagnosis of SSC-CIP and their course of disease, as described in the discharge summary?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patient's diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by ERCP, showing intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts.

Patient: 60-year-old male with moderate ARDS from COVID-19

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. During physical therapy on the acute ward, the patient experienced coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea with any change of position or deep breathing. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, a step-by-step approach was used for position changes. The breathing exercises were adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation, and with close monitoring, the patient managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level. Exercise progression was low initially but increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.

Clinical Outcome:

The patient was discharged on day 10 to a rehabilitation clinic making satisfactory progress with all symptoms resolved.

Follow-up:

The patient will receive follow-up care at the rehabilitation clinic, with regular monitoring of progress and further rehabilitation exercises until full recovery. Any new symptoms or concerns should be reported to the clinic immediately.

Overall Impression:

The patient responded well to treatment, and with appropriate medical intervention, was able to overcome the difficulties faced during hospitalization for ARDS from COVID-19. The patient's level of care was of a high standard, with all necessary therapy provided and monitoring of progress before discharge.</span></div></div>

Admission Diagnosis: Unspecified respiratory tract infection
Discharge Diagnosis: Resolved respiratory tract infection

Hospital Course: The patient was hospitalized due to persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks, leading to reduced general health condition. On admission, the patient required 4 L/min of oxygen due to rapid shallow breathing at rest and severe breathlessness during minor physical activity. The initial physical therapy focused on educating the patient on dyspnea-relieving positions, mobilization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises. However, with time, the patient's anxiety-induced dyspnea became an issue, leading to the modification of therapy to relieve his dyspnea.

The patient positively responded to the therapy, evidenced by a reduction in respiratory rate from 30 to 22 breaths/min and an increase in oxygen saturation from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen. Over the next few days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate gradually, and the patient regained his self-confidence. The therapy was eventually shifted to walking and strength training, and the patient was able to walk for 350m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before discharge.

Hospital Outcome: The patient was discharged home in an improved condition, with resolved respiratory tract infection, showing no need for further hospitalization. The patient was advised to follow-up with his regular healthcare professional for further monitoring and management of his health status.

Discharge Medications: None

Follow-up: The patient was advised to follow-up with his regular healthcare professional regarding further monitoring and management of his health status. 

Impression: Resolved respiratory tract infection with successful physical therapy for dyspnea relief and anxiety reduction. The patient responded well to therapy and regained his self-confidence, able to walk independently before discharge.</span></div></div>

Age: 57 years

Admission Diagnosis: Oxygen Desaturation

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the ICU one week after a positive COVID-19 result due to oxygen desaturation. Physical therapy was initiated promptly after admission, which helped improve the patient's breathing frequency and oxygen saturation. The patient was guided to achieve a prone position resulting in a significant increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. The patient continued to receive intensive physical therapy, positioning, and oxygen therapy for the next few days. Although there were challenges in achieving the prone position due to the patient's profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and high risk of symptom exacerbation, the medical team succeeded in implementing a safe and individualized approach.

After three days with this regime, the patient was transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists continued his rehabilitation, including walking and strength training. However, the patient's severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, after nine days from ICU admission, the patient was successfully discharged from the hospital as a pedestrian.

Discharge Condition:

At the time of discharge, the patient's medical condition had significantly improved, and he was considered stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The patient's oxygen saturation had returned to normal limits, and his breathing frequency had decreased significantly.

Summary:

This course summary demonstrates that the patient responded positively to a physical therapy treatment regimen, including positioning, deep-breathing exercises, and walking. Although the patient's medical condition was quite severe during the initial ICU admission, his rehabilitation resulted in marked improvement, leading to a successful discharge from the hospital.</span></div></div>

Patient: 69-year-old male

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 pneumonia, which was diagnosed after he experienced a dry cough for 2 weeks and showed poor oxygenation. Initially, he was given lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, and he remained stable. However, his condition worsened over the next days, and he developed hemodynamic instability and severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy because of these complications. Physical therapists were involved in this process, and they were responsible for ensuring the correct positioning of the patient's joints and preventing secondary complications, such as pressure ulcers, nerve lesions and contractures.
After the tracheostomy, the patient underwent passive range-of-motion exercises and passive side-edge mobilization. However, asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability persisted, inhibiting active participation. After spending 24 days in the ICU, the patient showed severe signs of muscle loss and scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx). The patient died soon after the withdrawal of life support.

Hospital Stay:
The patient was in the ICU for 24 days, where he received treatment interventions, including passive range of motion and positioning, intermittent prone positioning, and continuous renal replacement therapy. While in the ICU, the patient showed severe signs of muscle loss and developed pressure ulcer on the forehead.

Discharge Instruction:
The patient has been discharged in a stable condition. Although the patient was not discharged, we offer our sincere condolences to his family.</span></div></div>

Patient: 52-year-old male hospitalized for pneumonia and moderate ARDS

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital four days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain and tested COVID-19 positive. One day later, he was diagnosed with pneumonia that progressed into moderate ARDS and required mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, the patient experienced disorientation and an inability to communicate verbally due to global weakness (CPAx 11/50), accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Specialized physical therapy with the Gugging Swallowing Screen confirmed severe dysphagia, with the patient showing insufficient protection against aspiration. Treatment included therapy for dysphagia, such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and protection mechanism training, while receiving no food or drink by mouth. Over the next few days, the patient was able to swallow pureÃ©d food and mildly thick liquids under supervision, although cough strength remained weak. The patient progressed gradually and became capable of independent food ingestion before discharge.

Discharge:
The patient was discharged 25 days after admission to a rehabilitation clinic. The patient's respiratory condition stabilized, although dysphagia was still evident, with mild oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that continued to compromise paresthesia and needed ongoing regular oral care. Overall, the patient's condition improved and continued to progress during the hospital stay.</span></div></div>

Date of Discharge: N/A

HOSPITAL COURSE:

This 59-year-old female presented with dyspnea and an oxygen saturation level of 65%, leading to an immediate tracheal intubation due to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance. After being diagnosed, the patient was treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning. On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, resulting in a significant increase in the patient's level of consciousness and collaborative state. The patient's muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60. Despite the weakness, she was continuously encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity, and she was actively transferred to a chair each day. After successful extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia, which was closely monitored for secretion management and cough stimulation. Physical rehabilitation was continued, and the patient started walking with a walking aid on day 19. Her oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident at this point, and after 25 days, she was transferred to the institution's rehabilitation facilities where she received further treatment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

- Moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance
- Postextubation dysphagia
- ICU-acquired weakness
- Persistent physical function impairment

PROCEDURES:

- Immediate tracheal intubation
- Sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) trial
- Continuous physical therapy
- Successful extubation
- Close monitoring for secretion management and cough stimulation
- Walking with a walking aid

SUMMARY OF CARE:

This document serves as a summary of the hospital course of a 59-year-old female admitted due to dyspnea and diagnosed with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance. After treatment, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, resulting in the patient's significant level of consciousness improvement. Despite experiencing ICU-acquired weakness, the patient was continuously encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity, and after successful extubation, physical rehabilitation was continued until she was able to walk with a walking aid.

This 33-year-old female patient was admitted to the ICU due to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including high fever, dry cough, headache, and dyspnea. She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration and received physical therapy consisting of prone positioning and secondary damage prevention. From day 7 onwards, she exhibited significant improvement and was mobilized passively into a side-edge position. The patient was extubated but developed postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (mild muscle impairment). 

Post-Discharge Course:

Following her discharge from the ICU, the patient continued to suffer from pronounced delirium and anxiety. She was visited by her husband, which seemed to give her a short sense of security and eased her rehabilitation. However, the delirium persisted and did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital. 

Discharge Diagnosis:

The patient exhibited severe COVID-19 symptoms followed by postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness with pronounced delirium and anxiety.

Discharge Condition:

The patient's condition has stabilized and she was discharged to a peripheral acute hospital for further treatment. 

Discharge Medications:

None specified. 

Follow-up:

The patient is to follow up with her healthcare provider and/or return to the hospital for further treatment as needed.</span></div></div>

This 66-year-old male patient was admitted due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and experienced severe ARDS, resulting in intubation and ICU admission. The patient underwent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and physical therapy was initiated to focus on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. Despite a trial of sedation cessation, the patient remained somnolent and unable to communicate or follow commands. A side-edge positioning was initiated in combination with intensive exercise training including trunk and head control. Muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed. Occupational therapy was involved to support functional initiation of upper limb movements and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living.

This is a summary of the hospital course of a 66-year-old male patient who presented with fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Upon admission, the patient received oxygen therapy and was closely observed due to moderate ARDS, which resulted in an increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient was treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning for the first 12 days of his hospital stay. Due to persisting difficult weaning status correlated to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed.

After the tracheostomy, the patient showed improvement in his physical functions, including active SOEB, chair transfer, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes.

The patient continued to receive pressure support during exercises, enabling unloading of respiratory muscles, which culminated in a rapid improvement in his physical function. Upon transfer to the step-down unit, the patient experienced fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness, and dysphagia. However, his physical function ICU test score and walking distance both improved considerably.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]
Gender: Female
Age: 45 years

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital after collapsing at home due to a hypoglycemic event. She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems. On admission, she was malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. Her chest X-ray showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes. She was diagnosed with cholecystitis based on worsening liver enzymes and an abdominal ultrasound showing multiple small calculi and biliary debris, with gallbladder oedema. 

Treatment:
The patient was treated with appropriate antibiotics and underwent an inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out intra-biliary pathology, which was negative. Amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin were prescribed, which resulted in improvement in her inflammatory markers. She was referred to surgeons for consideration of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy once deemed fit. 

Outcome:
The patient had a long and difficult admission, leading to a transfer to an Eating Disorders Unit, which was delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Her weight improved with nasogastric feeding and supplements during her hospital stay. Her liver enzymes showed improvement during the course of her treatment. She was finally discharged in stable condition to the Eating Disorders Unit, weighing 56.4 kg (BMI = 18.1) from her admission weight of 37.3 kg (BMI = 12.6).

Post-Discharge Plan:
The patient will continue her treatment for AN at the Eating Disorders Unit. She will be followed up regularly by the team for her medical, nutritional, and psychiatric needs. Close monitoring of her weight, liver function tests, and gallbladder status will be carried out. The patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet and continue medications as per her discharge medications plan. Further evaluation of her cognitive and memory problems will be arranged. She will be advised to follow strict COVID-19 protocols to prevent infection.

Admitting Diagnosis: Severe malnutrition

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with bradycardia and hypoglycaemia with a capillary blood glucose level of 2.3 mmol/L. He had a history of eating and anxiety disorders and was severely malnourished. His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg, and his capillary blood glucose level improved to 4.7 mmol/L. He was noted to be cachexic and had abnormal liver function tests. His condition improved over the course of his 24-day admission, but he had a number of hypoglycaemic events and difficulty complying with treatment. Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he was placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding. His liver synthetic function improved over the course of his stay, but there were some concerns about nasogastric feeding, which led to worsening LFTs. He was discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit.

Discharge Diagnosis: Severe malnutrition, cachexia

Disposition: Discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit

Follow-up Plan: The patient was provided with a referral to the Eating Disorders Unit for continued care and management of his severe malnutrition and cachexia.

Course of Treatment:
- The patient was initially treated with intravenous glucose to address hypoglycaemia and rehydrate. He was subsequently started on nasogastric feeding to address his severe malnutrition and undernourishment.
- His liver function tests worsened with the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but a non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound provided reassurance.
- The patient's condition, LFTs, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his admission.
- The patient's compliance with treatment was challenging, and he required Mental Health Act 5(2) to ensure his continued care and management.
- The patient was discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit for further care and management of his severe malnutrition and cachexia.

Patient Name: X
Medical Record Number: X
Date of Admission: XX/XX/XX
Date of Discharge: XX/XX/XX

Hospital Course:
A 36-year-old premenopausal woman with a family history of colorectal, hepatobiliary cancerspresented with an abnormal right breast lump. Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a highly suggestive malignant breast mass, which was confirmed by a biopsy of the dominant lesion. The patient underwent a right breast simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation and her pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. She received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data, ovarian suppression was recommended to be considered as the patient had high-risk features. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression, the patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. Given the high-risk disease, the benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone was discussed, and the patient was hesitant about oophorectomy. She was started on triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days.

Summary of Findings:
The patient is a premenopausal woman with a family history of cancers who was diagnosed with a highly suggestive malignant breast mass. She underwent a right breast simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation, and the pathology revealed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. The patient received adjuvant PMRT and underwent ovarian suppression after initiation of which the patient started having a regular menstrual cycle. Triptorelin was started in place of goserelin due to failure of ovarian ablation.

Current Status:
The patient is now in a stable condition and was discharged with instructions to follow up with her oncologist for further management as advised. Recommended for molecular and genetic testing if not done in their initial evaluation. Also, advised to discuss the role of oophorectomy to manage risks and benefits of such treatment further with oncologist.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC that extended from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Due to the patientâ€™s history of advanced cirrhosis and large esophageal varices, anticoagulation was not an option. Palliative stenting of the IVC was performed to relieve the patientâ€™s pain and improve his quality of life.

Procedure:
Right internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. Initial attempts to cross the 100% occluded IVC with a Glidewire Advantage were unsuccessful. The IVC was successfully crossed with a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter. A multipurpose catheter was then advanced into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was replaced with a Glidewire Advantage. A 9 Ã— 80 Mustang balloon and then a 22 Ã— 70 mm Wallstent were used to perform IVC ballooning. Finally, an 18 Ã— 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was used to post-dilate the stent. Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient, a 45-year-old non-smoker with a history of type II diabetes and primary hyperparathyroidism, presented with an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. The patient had a medical history of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) which was diagnosed in 2006 and had been treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. In 2020, the patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions. After two courses of chemotherapy, the patient was lost to follow-up.

A year later, the patient was referred to the hematology department due to a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. The diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was confirmed based on microscopic and phenotypic results. The patient did not receive any maintenance therapy and was included in the LCH protocol as single-system LCH (SS-LCH), and she received the same chemotherapy combining prednisone, high-dose of methotrexate, and vinblastine. After five cycles of chemotherapy, the evolution was favorable with significant regression of lesions in the thigh without the appearance of any new lesions.

Admission Diagnosis: Obstructing ureteral stone with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis, severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath and three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain. Upon initial examination, the patient had significant work of breathing and abdominal breathing, with significant concern for acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work and CT-angiogram were ordered, revealing an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction and at the right ureterovesical junction, with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient was provided with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. Due to the expected clinical decline, he was intubated in the emergency department. After initial stabilization, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) was placed, and a trialysis catheter was inserted to initiate hemodialysis.

Upon transfer to the ICU, the patient was maintained on multiple vasopressors, consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated due to worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis, with the patientâ€™s pH stabilizing and blood pressure normalizing within 24 hours. The patient was successfully weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped on hospital day 3. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.

Discharge Medications:
The patient was discharged on the following medications: [missing from the original report]

Post-Discharge Instructions:
The patient was instructed to follow up with Urology in 1-2 weeks.

Discharge Condition:
Upon discharge, the patientâ€™s creatinine was 1.5, BUN 27, indicating recovering renal function, and he made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill.

Hospital Course:
The 67-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of persistent bright red blood per rectum. The patient had a significant medical history of hypertension, high cholesterol, Type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy after being diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial adenoma 15 months prior to current presentation. The patient had no prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Admission Findings:
Physical examination revealed mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination revealed nonbleeding hemorrhoids. Blood work showed an elevated white blood cell count and low hemoglobin. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were slightly elevated as well. A colonoscopy revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon. Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and tattooed margins. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells indicating an endometrial primary.

Treatment and Discharge:
The patient underwent surgical resection of the affected colon followed by radiation therapy. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal, and pan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease. One year post-surgery, the patient is doing well without any active GI complaints and is discharged. Appropriate home care instructions were given to the patient upon discharge. 

Follow-up:
The patient is advised to have regular follow-up appointments with their primary care physician and gastroenterologist to keep a close watch for any possible recurrences. The patient is instructed to follow-up with their oncologist for further treatment recommendations. The patient was provided with a copy of these discharge instructions before leaving the hospital.</span></div></div>

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial flutter, and sick sinus syndrome who presented to the hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Laboratory evaluation revealed abnormal liver function tests with elevated AST/ALT and ALP levels and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg/dL.

Imaging studies, including ultrasound of the abdomen, CT abdomen and pelvis, CT angiography of the chest, and HIDA scan were negative for acute pathology. Given the patient's medical history, the differential diagnosis included leukemic infiltration of the liver or adverse reaction to prior chemotherapy.

A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed, and the results showed high-grade tumor cells with positive immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK20, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, and negative for CK7, CDX-2, and TTF-1. These findings were consistent with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.

The patient and family opted for comfort care measures given the medical comorbidities and were discharged home with consultation with Hematology/Oncology and Dermatology.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman who presented with difficulty breathing and dissatisfaction with her facial appearance. She had a history of childhood trauma resulting in nasal septum deviation and external nasal deformity. Four months after a successful septorhinoplasty, she presented to the emergency department with blunt nasal trauma resulting in a septal hematoma, which was drained successfully; the patient was discharged with no adverse sequelae.

Four months later, the patient sustained nasal trauma again, resulting in clear nasal discharge, raising suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was discharged from the hospital after managing the nasal injury, as the CT brain showed an intact cribriform plate with no evidence of a CSF leak. Ten days later, she presented at the emergency department with dizziness and an unstable gait.

Findings:

The patient presented with additional symptoms such as paresthesia, starting in her right hand and progressing to the right shoulder, arm, and leg, and some difficulty in executing movements in the first and second finger of her right hand. She also had stiffness in her right leg and difficulty walking. On close inquiry, she gave a history of pain in the right eye and double vision many months earlier, which had resolved spontaneously. Examination showed a positive Rombergâ€™s and Lhermitteâ€™s sign, with right-sided sensory impairment.

Diagnosis And Treatment:

MRI of the brain, cervical, and thoracic spine demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the brain and cervical segment of the spinal cord. Some of the lesions showed enhancement on post gadolinium administration sequences, suggestive of active demyelinating diseases like MS. A lumbar puncture was performed revealing the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. The diagnosis of MS was confirmed by a neurologist, and treatment was initiated.

Outcome:

The initial neurological symptoms have largely vanished, with only persistent light paresthesia in the right hand. Two years later, the patient has had no new symptoms and continues with the same medication, with good tolerance. The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow-up with the neurologist for management and monitoring of her MS condition.</span></div></div>

The patient, a 68-year-old female with a history of G3P2 pregnancy and a pancreatoduodenectomy to remove a duodenal papillae adenocarcinoma, was admitted to the hospital for suspicion of an ovarian tumor. Upon examination, a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa was discovered. The patient was referred to the Department of Urology.

Investigations:
Urinalysis revealed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. 

Diagnosis:
Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed to remove the 2-cm papillary tumor. The pathology report confirmed that the mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a). The patient was administered intravesical chemotherapy. 

Outcome:
At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was observed. Postoperative CT examination has not yet been conducted. The patient was discharged in stable condition.

Medical Record Number: [redacted]
Date of Admission: [redacted]
Date of Discharge: [redacted]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted due to lower back pain associated with weakness of lower extremities, numbness, tingling, and balance issues. She also had constipation and urinary incontinence. A workup was initiated for an occult malignancy due to diffuse osteosclerotic lesions in visualized bones. CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary lesions but several subcutaneous lesions on the back. MRI of the brain and spine showed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brainstem extending along the entire spinal cord. Lumbar puncture showed increased protein and white blood cells in cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis. Finally, a right iliac bone biopsy was done that revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast.

Treatment:

The patient was started on letrozole initially with dexamethasone taper, followed by palliative radiation therapy with 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the lumbosacral spine which improved her lower back pain. After completion of the radiation therapy, abemaciclib was added to letrozole as the systemic therapy and she showed excellent response to the treatment. She does continue to have sclerotic changes in her bones; however, she deferred from bone-targeted therapy.

Follow-up:

The patient has been on abemaciclib and letrozole for about two years, her neurological symptoms have improved, and now she has a good quality of life. She is able to walk half a mile on flat ground and is able to perform light household chores.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
MRN: [REDACTED]
DOB: [REDACTED]
Admission Date: [REDACTED]
Discharge Date: [REDACTED]

Clinical Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with no known comorbidities who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child. She was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs, which progressed rapidly to quadriplegia. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She was diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) due to idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination. The patient was treated with sodium correction and pulse methylprednisolone and discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.

One year later, the patient presented to the neurology department with generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs, which made her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Clinical examination revealed pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. The patient was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities. Basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia, and arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive for anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies, and minor salivary gland biopsy was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Hospital Course:
The patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation and subsequently shifted to oral liquid formulation. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone and referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.

Discharge Medications:
N/A

Follow-Up Appointments:
The patient was referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

Instructions:
The patient should follow-up with her rheumatologist. The patient should continue taking oral potassium and sodium bicarbonate as prescribed. The patient should maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance.

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) due to idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination
2. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) with renal tubular acidosis and hypokalemia-related quadriparesis due to hypokalemia

Disposition:
The patient was discharged in stable condition.</span></div></div>

Patient name: [redacted]

Date of admission: [redacted]

Date of discharge: [redacted]

Diagnosis: SAPHO syndrome

Hospital course:

The patient, an 18-year-old male, was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of right hip pain for two weeks which worsened when attempting movement. The patient had a history of similar episodes in the past four years but was not diagnosed with any medical condition. Physical examination revealed mild to moderate tenderness in the right hip joint and a decreased range of motion. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits, and X-rays of the pelvis and right thigh were unremarkable. However, an MRI of the right thigh showed trochanteric bursa effusion and synovitis of the right hip joint. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol were started for management, and the patient showed excellent improvement in the first three months.

Four months later, the patient complained of swelling in the right sternoclavicular joint. Laboratory investigations were normal, but MRI showed a patchy area of hyperintensity on T2 and hypointensity on T1 images close to the sternoclavicular junction. On post-contrast images, there was a mild accentuated heterogeneous enhancement. A trace of fluid was also noted in the joint space, and marrow edema was seen along the articular margin and body of the sternum. Imaging data and clinical history were indicative of SAPHO syndrome, and the patient was started on paracetamol and NSAIDs. At the one-month follow-up, the swelling had improved, and the patient was continued on the therapy which significantly resolved symptoms within three months.

Outcome:

The condition of the patient significantly improved with treatment, and there were no further signs of recurrence. The patient was informed of lifestyle modifications to manage pain and inflammation, including maintaining physical fitness, minimizing joint strain, and adopting an anti-inflammatory diet. The patient was evaluated for further follow-up.</span></div></div>

On physical examination, marked tenderness of the right sternoclavicular joint was noted. Initial laboratory investigations and chest X-rays were unremarkable, although MRI revealed subchondral bone marrow edema and enhancement involving the medial end of the right clavicle. In addition, mild effusion of the right sternoclavicular joint and surrounding soft-tissue edema was also seen. Given the patient's radiological and clinical findings, suspicion of SAPHO syndrome was raised. He was prescribed paracetamol and NSAIDs, which led to a remarkable improvement in his symptoms.

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and a BMI of 30.37 kg/m2. She presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, abdominal pain, hematemesis, and hypotension. In the emergency department, her vitals were notable for a blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, a temperature of 87.1 Fahrenheit, and a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. A Mallory-Weiss tear with portohypertensive gastropathy was discovered through esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was thought to be caused by repeated vomiting. She was also diagnosed with acute pancreatitis due to peripancreatic edema and fat stranding on CT scan. Labs were remarkable for high glucose, high HgbA1c, and high triglyceride levels.

Treatment:
The patient received 5L of fluid as well as one unit of packed red blood cells for suspected large fluid volume loss. She was intubated for airway protection and placed on an insulin drip for her elevated blood glucose. After her glucose normalized, she was continued on an insulin drip until her triglycerides dropped below 500 mg/dL. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet without significant pain or discomfort and was subsequently downgraded to the general medical floor.

Outcome:
The patient's condition improved and she was discharged from the hospital. No further recommendations or follow-ups were mentioned in the patient's case report.</span></div></div>

Patient: 53-month-old Sudanese female
Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with progressive bilateral breast enlargement and accelerated growth since the age of 9 months. Examination revealed a well-looking girl, vitally stable, with normal blood pressure. The patient had no vaginal bleeding, no pubic or axillary hair, and her Tanner staging was A1, P1, and B3. A bone age of 8 years was discovered through a left wrist X-ray. Hormonal evaluation showed elevated levels of estradiol E2 and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate with normal early morning cortisol level. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a right-sided hypoechoic suprarenal mass, and an abdominal CT scan showed a well-defined rounded focal lesion with no evidence of local tissue invasion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of a central cause of precocious puberty. A diagnosis of an estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor was made, and the patient underwent laparotomy during which a 3 cm diameter tumor in the right adrenal gland was excised. The histopathological examination revealed a benign adrenal cortical adenoma. The postoperative evaluation revealed normal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and the patient was started on monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist.

Diagnosis:
1. Estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor
2. Precocious puberty
3. Benign adrenal cortical adenoma

Plan:
1. Monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist
2. Regular follow-up for the possibility of recurrence of adrenal adenoma</span></div></div>

Admission Date: 8 August 2019
Discharge Date: N/A

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted due to back pain and cough.

Medical History:
The patient has been exposed to chemicals due to his occupation as a farmer and had a history of smoking for 40 years.

Diagnostic Test Results:
A thoracic CT scan revealed a malignant tumor in the left upper lobe that was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and multiple bone metastases. IHC and histopathologic observations confirmed the diagnosis of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. A 733-gene NGS panel indicated the presence of an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. NGS-based CNV analyses showed the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion, which are associated with secondary MDS. The physiological blood indexes and bone marrow aspiration test confirmed MDS.

Hospital Course:
The patient was administered with gefitinib for the EGFR-positive mutation and azacitidine for four courses of treatment due to decreasing platelet counts. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and maximal tumor size did not decrease after seven monthsâ€™ treatment. Due to infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells in the fibrous tissue, the patient was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor with small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounting for about 40% and 60%, respectively. Positive PD-L1 expression and high TMB in the tissue sample led to the administration of toripalimab and bevacizumab. The patient's platelet counts gradually returned to near-normal levels, and the tumor lesion shrunk obviously.

Patient Name: Japanese woman (41-year-old)

Admission Date: [DATE]
Discharge Date: [DATE]

Reason for Admission:

The patient presented to our clinic with bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain that had been present for the last 4 months. Her right hip had been more painful than her left hip.

Past Medical History:

The patient had a history of iron-deficiency anemia that was diagnosed 2 years earlier. She had been treated with iron supplements but had not experienced any fracture episodes or other complications.

Hospital Course:

During the hospital course, the patient underwent standard radiographs of both hips, which revealed no characteristic findings. MRI scans showed a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head, and a high signal region in all of the femoral head. DEXA values were low in both femoral necks.

The patient was diagnosed with bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified as stage 1 in both femoral heads, as per the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification. She was instructed to avoid bearing weight on the right side, which led to immediate symptom improvement.

However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly. Radiographic findings showed almost no change, but a slight signal change was observed in the medial subcapital region in the MRI scan. Her pain continued to worsen, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips, and MRI scans showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on both femoral necks.

Further examination revealed low DEXA values, an increase in TRACP-5b level, and a decrease in total P1NP; the patient was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. The fractures were stabilized by surgery with the use of sliding hip screws, and the femoral heads were decompressed. Eldecalcitol and teriparatide acetate were administered, and the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally.

Discharge Plan:

The patient was discharged with close follow-up and instructions to continue the prescribed medications. Her walking ability improved gradually, and her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hips at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis. The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend regular follow-up visits.</span></div></div>

Hospital Course:

The 14-year-old male adolescent was admitted to the emergency department due to subfebrile temperatures and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa. Prior to these symptoms, the patient had been immobilized following a minor sports injury. The patient's medical history revealed an asymptomatic antithrombin deficiency (ATD) diagnosed 8 years ago and a maternal history of ATD. No other hereditary thrombophilic disorders were detected. The patient's blood analysis indicated elevated levels of D-dimers and C-reactive protein (CrP), and reduced antithrombin activity. The vascular ultrasound confirmed thrombosis of the right lower extremity. The patient received continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban. Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed complete deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, and extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. It also revealed occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals suggestive of IVC associated with ATD. Catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was initiated in both extremities. Anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon. The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission.

A follow-up examination showed extended re-thrombosis of both pelvic axes and the right lower extremity, leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy. Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, but the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic. The patient's oral anticoagulation was intensified to prevent re-thrombosis. Regular follow-up examinations at the outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date.

The patient was discharged on day seven after admission. The left iliac vessels remain thrombotic, but the IVC was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting. The patientâ€™s mother was also found to have recanalized IVC upon angiography intervention.

Discharge Diagnosis:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, left lower extremity, both iliac vessels, and inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD).

2. Recanalized IVC and thrombotic left iliac vessels.

3. IVCA.

Recommendations:

1. Oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon should be continued lifelong to prevent thrombosis due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD.

2. Follow-up examinations should be done regularly at the outpatient clinic.

3. The patient and their family should be counseled on the importance of continued medical management for ATD.

4. More interventions should be done for thrombotic lesions found in pelvic vessels.

Admission Date: 04/05/2021
Discharge Date: 04/05/2021

Reason for Admission: Radio-surgical management of brain metastasis

Medical History: The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, with a history of heavy smoking until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010, and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid, and atorvastatin medication that he continues until this day.

Hospital Course: The patient presented with neurological symptoms, including loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and other health complications. The patient was appropriately managed with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy and WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which offered partial relief of symptoms.

However, in March 2021, the patient reapplied with similar symptoms and was recommended radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with TrueBeamÂ® (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) LINAC. All necessary preparations were done; treatment simulation was done on the CT images with SPACE sequence and GTV and PTV were defined accordingly.

Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System), and dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals, as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines.

Before treatment, the patient was given a 16mg intramuscular depot dexamethasone injection to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to significant edema from the cerebellar metastasis. The effective time of treatment was of four minutes.

Outcome and Discharge: Follow-up was programmed 15 days after the treatment, at which the patient presented clinically significant improvement, including absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait. There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. 

During the follow-up MRI on July 17, 2021, the patient showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass. The patient remains in continuous follow-up, with the last reported telephonic follow-up, on September 2, 2021, reporting no symptoms and carrying out all his regular day-to-day activities without any limitations.</span></div></div>

Date of Admission: December 2, 2020
Date of Discharge: December 26, 2020
Medical Record Number: [redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 68-year-old female with no prior history of mental illness, was admitted to the hospital due to anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to leave her home, speaking less, being slow to respond, and urinary incontinence. The patient had been diagnosed with GAD at a local mental health center and was prescribed paroxetine, tandospirone, and oxazepam prior to admission, which had initially improved her symptoms.

Upon physical examination, the patient had normal limb muscle strength and tone, but her gait was not stable and she took small steps. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously and had reported no other comorbidities.

Lab testing revealed that the patient had subclinical hypothyroidism with diffused thyroid lesions and nodular changes as well as anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Imaging of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis, while EEG recordings revealed diffuse slow waves. Based on her symptoms of rapidly progressive dementia and psychomotor retardation, and negative imaging and lab findings, the patient was suspected to have a paraneoplastic syndrome.

However, lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed and showed a high anti-glutamate receptor (NMDA) ratio, leading to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was transferred to the neurology department and treated with immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. After treatment, the patient showed gradual improvement in cognitive and emotional function and was discharged 24 days after admission without relapse at a 6-month follow-up.

Hospital Diagnoses:
1. Subclinical hypothyroidism with nodular changes
2. Autoimmune encephalitis

Hospital Procedures:
1. Lumbar puncture
2. Cerebrospinal fluid examination

Hospital Medications:
1. Venlafaxine
2. Oxazepam
3. Immunoglobulin (IVIG)
4. Methylprednisolone

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should continue regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and neurologist to monitor her hypothyroidism and autoimmune encephalitis, respectively. She should also have regular monitoring of her blood glucose levels to manage her type-II diabetes. If the patient experiences a relapse of symptoms, she should seek immediate medical attention.</span></div></div>

This is a discharge summary for a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background. The patient was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions. The patient was treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement.

The patient presented with a worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles. A skin biopsy showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163.

After considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam.

The disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission.

Six months after the end of maintenance therapy the patient had a recurrence of the disease and started second-line chemotherapy with clofarabine and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The patient did not comply with the treatment and the disease progressed. As a result of skin ulceration, she developed skin and soft tissue infection that evolved into septic shock and did not survive despite intensive care support.</span></div></div>

Patient Information:

Name: [Redacted]
Age: 72 years
Gender: Male
Admission Date: January 2019
Discharge Date: July 2021
Admitting Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma lung with multiple metastases

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of pain in the right hip, associated with difficulty in walking, and was found to have a pathological fracture at the neck of the right femur. He was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases on evaluation with PET-CT scan of the whole body. The patient underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing and palliative external beam radiotherapy for the pathological fracture. He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019. An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response.

After 10 cycles of immunotherapy, the patient discontinued Inj. pembrolizumab due to personal reasons and was started on chemotherapy, Inj. pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and Inj. bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019. The patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively. The patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy.

The patient was readmitted in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness. On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site. Palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered. In June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases. The patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks. The patient's condition further deteriorated, and in July, he succumbed to disease progression.

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases.

Admission Date: [Redacted]        Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Admission Diagnosis: Stroke

Hospital Course and Treatment:

The patient, a 90-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with a severe stroke. On admission, the patient presented with left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8/15, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 26. A head CT was performed, which showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with the patient's age. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, but the patient's GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. A repeat head CT showed no acute findings. The patient's condition was monitored conservatively to prevent further deterioration.

Over the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent. When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands. The patient had limited rehabilitation potential, with fatigue limiting conversations and poor engagement during therapy sessions. A third head CT several days after admission confirmed a bilateral thalamic infarct, with small left parietal cortical infarction. Imaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP).

The patient participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation sessions over the next month and had a gradual return of physical function. He was unable to care for himself independently and was eventually discharged to a care home.

Discharge Diagnosis:

Stroke with bilateral thalamic infarcts and small left parietal cortical infarction.

Discharge Medications:

The patient's current medications were not listed in the case report.

Discharge Instructions:

The patient was discharged to a care home, where he would receive ongoing care.

Follow-up:

The patient passed away one year after the initial presentation to the hospital from an intercurrent chest infection. No further follow-up was necessary.</span></div></div>

Patient has been admitted to the hospital for Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) which was suspected during his inpatient stay after presenting with urinary retention issues and facial weakness and numbness. AIDP was diagnosed via EDX studies and the patient was treated with a five-day course of IVIG. On completion of his IVIG treatment, the patient was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation with significant proximal lower extremity weakness and bilateral upper extremities slight weakness. The patient had also lost significant strength in his bilateral lower extremities where dorsiflexion was graded at 1/5 and plantar flexion was graded at 3/5. Sensation to light touch had also diminished in all dermatomes of bilateral upper extremities. 

Upon evaluation in inpatient rehabilitation, patient required significant help to perform toileting hygiene, showering, upper body dressing, lower body dressing, footwear management, rolling left and right, and all transfers. The patient was unable to ambulate and was dependent on a wheelchair. During his four weeks of inpatient therapy, the patient improved significantly, achieving independence in supine-to-sit, upper and lower body dressing, and rolling right and left in bed. The patient was able to stand with the support of his spouse and primarily relied on bilateral upper extremity support via a walker for stability and offloading his lower extremities. At discharge, the patient was given a power wheelchair for mobility as he was unable to transfer in and out of a car, thus requiring a wheelchair van for transportation. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout his stay with a reading of 121/65 mmHg upon discharge.</span></div></div>

Hospital Course Summary:
Admitted from a local minor injuries unit with an injury to the left ring finger following exposure to Newton 103-S, a type of liquid cement. Upon examination, the finger appeared swollen and had necrotic skin on the volar aspect. The patient underwent debridement and washout under general anaesthetic after antibiotics were administered. The initial surgical approach consisted of Bruner incisions to remove the significant hardened concrete in the subcutaneous tissues. A second look was performed at 48 hours, which revealed further cement material. The patient underwent a cross-finger flap from the ipsilateral middle finger one week post-injury- the reconstructed volar soft tissue area was large. The flap was divided and inset at three weeks, and at four months post-injury, there was a 20-84 degree range of active movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint. The protective sensation is still preserved in the radial aspect of the digit. The patient was eager to return to work and reported no issues with pain in his hand.</span></div></div>

Patient Name: Patient 1
Gender: Male
Age: 65 years

Presentation and Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in January 2020 based on leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed a hypercellular bone marrow with 50% blasts. The patient was further assessed using flow cytometry and cytogenetics, and molecular panel testing showed aberrations in ASXL1, CEBPA, JAK2, and RUNX1. AML with adverse risk was diagnosed according to genetic risk stratification. 

Hospital Course:
After one course of induction treatment with the IA regimen, the patient achieved complete remission with low minimal residual disease. Genetic analyses showed negative gene mutations, and the patient received consolidation therapies with the IA regimen and high-dose Ara-c (HiDAC) regimen. However, remission duration only lasted for 11 months, and in November 2020, relapsed BM morphology was detected, indicating relapsed AML with concurrent molecular aberration recurrence. The patient underwent several treatment regimens, including venetoclax combined with azacitidine and chidamide with venetoclax and azacitidine regimen. He achieved complete remission after one course of the chidamide combined regimen. 

Outcome:
The patient passed away due to disease progression three months after the completion of therapy.

Summary:
The patient was diagnosed with AML in January 2020 based on presenting symptoms. Over the course of his treatment regimen, the patient achieved complete remission followed by relapse and subsequent treatment modification. Despite his best efforts and the use of several different therapies, the patient ultimately succumbed to his disease.</span></div></div>

Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient presented to our institution with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, which was refractory to two courses of chemotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with SÃ©zary Syndrome, Stage IVA. Subsequently, several therapies were attempted, including an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV), which led to an improvement of skin lesions. However, an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) was ultimately performed due to persistent disease. The transplant initially showed residual infiltration of SÃ©zary Syndrome cells but ultimately led to complete hematological remission. The patient developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the ocular mucosa and the liver after discontinuation of immunosuppression. The patient required immunosuppressive treatment but is now in continuous complete remission of SÃ©zary Syndrome.

DIAGNOSES:
1. SÃ©zary Syndrome, Stage IVA
2. Chronic graft-versus-host disease of ocular mucosa and liver

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient presented to our institution with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma, which was refractory to two courses of chemotherapy. The diagnosis was later revised to SÃ©zary Syndrome, Stage IVA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient underwent several therapies, including an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV). The patient ultimately underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT), resulting in complete hematological remission. However, the patient subsequently developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the ocular mucosa and the liver.

DISCHARGE PLAN:
The patient will continue to require immunosuppressive treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease of ocular mucosa and liver and will require ongoing monitoring for possible relapse of SÃ©zary Syndrome. Follow-up appointments with the patient's oncologist and ophthalmologist are recommended.

Hospital Course:
The 37-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with septic shock, neurogenic bladder, chronic renal insufficiency, and history of total cystectomy with ileal bladder replacement. At admission, the patient required noradrenaline and phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure after fluid resuscitation, and blood culture analyses were negative. The patient was treated with a combination of meropenem and vancomycin and required continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for organ support.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient's vital signs tended to stabilise, and CVVH was reduced from daily to every other day. Puncture and catheterisation were performed on left subphrenic effusions under the guidance of B-ultrasound on the ninth day, which showed Escherichia coli and Enterococcus avium in the drainage fluid. The patient's intra-abdominal infection improved, and the function of organs other than the kidney returned to normal. On day 22, the culture of drainage fluid was negative. Vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued. On day 26, the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit and resumed routine hemodialysis. 

Discharge Diagnosis:
Septic shock, neurogenic bladder, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Hospital Course:
The patient's hospital course was significant for the management of septic shock, neurogenic bladder, and chronic renal insufficiency. Upon admission, the patient required noradrenaline and phenylephrine for blood pressure support. Blood culture analyses were negative. A combination of meropenem and vancomycin was administered, and CVVH was used for organ support. Puncture and catheterisation were performed on left subphrenic effusions, showing the presence of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus avium in the drainage fluid. The patient's intra-abdominal infection improved, and the function of organs other than the kidney returned to normal. On day 22, the culture of drainage fluid was negative. Vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued. On day 26, the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit and resumed routine hemodialysis.

Hospital course timeline:
Day 1: Patient admitted with septic shock, neurogenic bladder, and chronic renal insufficiency; requiring noradrenaline and phenylephrine for blood pressure support.
Day 2 - 6: Continuous venovenous hemofiltration and 1000 mg meropenem q12 h ivgtt combined with vancomycin (loading dose on D1 of 1500 mg and maintenance dose of 1000 mg on D2) administered.
Day 7 - 8: The patient's vital signs tended to stabilise, and CVVH was reduced to every other day.
Day 9: Puncture and catheterisation of left subphrenic effusions conducted under the guidance of B-ultrasound, showing the presence of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus avium in the drainage fluid.
Day 10 - 21: The patient's intra-abdominal infection improved, and the function of organs other than the kidney returned to normal.
Day 22: Culture of drainage fluid was negative, thus vancomycin and meropenem were stopped.
Day 23 - 26: Patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit and resumed routine hemodialysis.</span></div></div>

This is a summary of the hospital course of a 5-year-old boy who was admitted with headache, right eye pain, and vomiting. He was diagnosed with acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema and underwent an external ventricular drain insertion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered, and the patient was classified as probable TB. A standard anti-TB regimen was initiated, and the patient's condition improved after 14 days. He was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay. One month later, he presented again with vomiting, unsteady gait, and anorexia. A follow-up MRI revealed an exuberant nodular leptomeningeal enhancement that was more extensive than the initial study. Histopathological examination revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation, and the patient was diagnosed with DL-GNT. The parents opted for palliative treatment.

Summary of Findings:

The patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9 and left lateral strabismus. The pupils were unequal (4 mm/3 mm) and sluggish. Power in all four limbs was 4/5 with normal reflexes. Babinski was downgoing, and Kernig's sign was not elicited. Non-contrast CT brain showed acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema, while MRI brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered based on high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and elevated CSF protein with normal CSF glucose levels. Histopathological examination revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation, and the patient was diagnosed with DL-GNT. 

Treatment:

The patient was administered a standard anti-TB regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. Intravenous dexamethasone was prescribed during the first 2 weeks of admission and was subsequently changed to oral administration.

Outcome:

The patient's condition improved considerably after 14 days, and he was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay. However, one month later, he presented again with vomiting, unsteady gait, and anorexia. The parents opted for palliative treatment, and the patient succumbed to the illness 3 months later, 22 weeks in total, after diagnosis.</span></div></div>

Admitting Diagnosis: Fever and cough

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 1.9-year-old girl, was admitted to our hospital due to 4-day fever and cough, with no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed fatigue and depressions in suprasternal fossa, supraclavicular fossa, and intercostal space. The patient developed hypoxemia, and her right lung showed diminished breath sounds. Routine blood tests showed high C-reactive protein levels. Pulmonary CT suggested consolidation with atelectasis in the middle lobe of the right lung. Electrocardiogram indicated sinus rhythm. The patient received antimicrobial therapy on admission.

On the 2nd day, the first fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) was performed to relieve atelectasis and obtain respiratory samples for bacteriologic, cytologic, and histologic detection. On the 3rd day, azithromycin and methylprednisolone were applied for anti-inflammation. The titer of MP-immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 1:160. On the 5th day, due to persistent fever, and lesions on chest radiography progressed after conventional anti-infective therapy, the second FB was performed, and plastic bronchitis in the airwaywas found. MP-DNA was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). MP resistance mutation site 2063/2064 showed positive. The patient was discharged on the 17th day.

On the 24th day, the patient developed a sudden high fever. On the 30th day, there was a significant improvement observed in chest X-ray. The third FB was used on 27th day, and bronchial casts were removed. The patient did not present any discomfort within 60 days.

Discharge Condition:

The patient's fever resolved, and the clinical symptoms and imaging improved. The patient was discharged in stable condition.

Discharge Medications:

No medications were prescribed at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:

Follow up with the primary care provider within a week for a clinical evaluation. If the patient's symptoms return, or there is difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</span></div></div>

The patient was started on nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and methylprednisolone was administered for anti-inflammation. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a temperature of 38.3Â°C, heart rate of 135 beats/minute, respiration rate of 45 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg, fatigue, flaring of nares, and decreased respiratory sounds in the left lung.

Diagnostic Findings:

Cardiovascular, neurological, and extremity exams were normal. The ANA and ENA laboratory studies were also normal. Routine blood tests showed Hb 118g/L, WBC 6.25x109/L, N 55.3%, L 37.6%, and CRP 26mg/L. On day 4, pulmonary CT demonstrated inflammatory consolidation with left pleural effusion. The fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed fibrinoid formation in the left upper and lower lobes, consistent with plastic bronchitis. The BAL fluid test did not reveal any other etiology aside from the presence of MP-DNA and Epstein Barr (EB)-DNA up to 1x108 copies/mL and 4.8x105 copies/mL, respectively. Hypokalemia (K 3.28mmol/L) and coagulation abnormalities were also present during disease presentation.

Treatment:

The patient subsequently received a second fiberoptic bronchoscopy to relieve bronchial casts in response to increased patchy shadow shown on chest radiography on day 5. The patient received methylprednisolone at a dose of 10mg/kg/day and gamma globulin at 2g/kg. The methylprednisolone was continued for a total of 11 days, and medical management resulted in an improved fever, lower oxygen demand, and resolution of anoxia by day 6 of treatment. The patient was discharged on the 12th day due to clinical improvement, and follow-up MP-IgM titer demonstrated an eight-fold increase on the 14th day. Cough persisted on the 18th day. The chest X-ray showed complete resolution 48 days after hospital admission.</span></div></div>

Patient Name: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Age: 6
Total Hospital Stay: 9 months

Reason for Admission:
The patient was referred to the cardiology unit of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Bologna with a history of exercise intolerance and a syncopal episode. 

History of Present Illness:
The patient developed clinical signs during a wave of COVID-19 two weeks after the family of the owner showed symptoms of the disease. Clinical examination at our institution was postponed due to quarantine of the owners.

Hospital Course Summary:
Upon presentation, LV volume overload and global systolic dysfunction without left atrial dilation were discovered. Mild mitral regurgitation with central jet was present due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype. Routine blood work, including a thyroid profile, and assessment of the serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were unremarkable. Initial serological tests for infections responsible for MI were performed and showed negative results. Upon the discovery of a positive COVID-19 result, additional serological tests were performed, and all results were positive. Exercise restriction was recommended, and pimobendan was prescribed. An improvement in exercise tolerance was reported with no further syncopal episodes. 

At the final examination, heart murmurs were detected, but LV systolic function had mildly improved. All serological assays were still positive, and cTnI was elevated but nearing the HRI. The patient was discharged with a prescription for pimobendan. 

Follow-up Care:
The patient is currently alive and healthy, with regular echocardiographic examinations.</span></div></div>

Patient Information:
Age: 11 months
Gender: Female
Breed: Brown
Diagnosis: Bovine viral diarrhea virus persistent infection (BVDV-PI)

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 11-month-old female PI calf, was admitted to the Veterinary Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy on 12 April 2021 for diagnostic confirmation of BVDV PI. The calf had been identified in a herd of Apulia region, Italy, that consisted of 99 Alpine Brown cattle, all under the age of 1 year. The patient had undergone virological and bacteriological investigations before arrival, which revealed the presence of BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Upon arrival, the patient was hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Unit and clinically examined two times a day during the entire period of hospitalization. The patient was kept in a separate room with straw bedding, was fed a commercial concentrate twice daily, and had access to haylage and water ad libitum. The facility was closed for other animals and had restricted admission for people. Two days after arrival, the patient showed hyperthermia (39.8 Â°C), and additional samples were collected to monitor its health status and to assess the presence of concomitant virological/bacteriological infections.

Diagnostic Findings:
The presence of BVDV and BCoV was confirmed in nasal swabs, fecal swabs, and EDTA-treated blood collected from the patient, and BVDV antibodies were detected in serum samples.

Treatment:
The patient did not receive any specific treatment for BVDV-PI during hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was observed for 60 days, during which stool samples, nasal swabs, serum samples, and EDTA-treated blood were collected weekly until BCoV tests were negative. The patient is currently in the hospital and has not been discharged. Further treatment will be provided, as needed.</span></div></div>

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient, a 53-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was admitted to our clinic due to the gradual worsening of his symptoms. He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, which was well-controlled with ACE inhibitors. He had been receiving oral anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran and antiarrhythmic therapy for the past few years, but his arrhythmic episodes persisted and required multiple admissions to the emergency room. After a thorough assessment, we proposed atrial fibrillation ablation to the patient.

PROCEDURE:
We performed bipolar mapping of the right atrium with the ThermoCool SmartTouch SF ablation catheter. The inferior and superior vena cava, and coronary sinus were delineated, and the His potential was tagged in yellow. The interatrial septum was carefully reconstructed, and the Fossa ovalis was precisely defined by setting the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25-0.75 mV and tagging all the fragmented and low voltage signals in light blue. The FO location was further confirmed by ICE and the CartoSound module. We also assessed and reconstructed the structures of the left atrium using ICE and the CartoSound module. A single transseptal puncture was performed using the VIZIGO sheath and transseptal needle. The ThermoCool SmartTouch SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO sheath into the left atrium to perform anatomical mapping and PVI, following the CLOSE protocol. Ablations were performed with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. The entire procedure lasted 100 minutes, and there were no complications.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:
At discharge, the patient had no more symptoms and did not report any arrhythmic recurrences. He was not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs and was on apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control.

FOLLOW-UP:
The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presented no more symptoms, has not had any recurrences of AF, and was compliant with his medication.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient was advised to continue with apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control. He was advised to contact us if he experienced any new cardiac symptoms, such as palpitations or shortness of breath. The patient should also schedule a regular follow-up visit with his primary care physician to monitor his blood pressure and cardiac function.

Admission Disposition: Medical Department

Chief Complaint: Persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor

History of Present Illness: The patient, a 20-year-old Caucasian male, was admitted to the medical department with persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. The symptoms had started at home four days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. The laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, AST 150 UI/L, and ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission, and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein. On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF spectrometry.

Hospital Course: The patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations. A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierreâ€™s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The source control includes an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. The patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and required mechanical ventilation. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole was added to piperacillin/tazobactam. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin. There was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved. Despite the adequate mean arterial pressure, there was a new worsening of the clinical status featured anemia without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring showed a hyperdynamic septic state. Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, hydrocortisone was added to argipressin and norepinephrine, leading to paramount hemodynamic improvement. Continuous hemofiltration was carried out to treat the inflammatory response by four cycles. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia monitoring and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion, and a new CT showed a persistence of known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program.

Condition on Discharge: Good health condition

Plan and Follow-Up: The patient was discharged to the rehabilitation care unit to continue the antibiotics therapy and rehabilitation program. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after three months, which demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.</span></div></div>

IMAGING AND LAB RESULTS:

Immunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45 were diffusely reactive and -catenin showed non-specific cytoplasmic staining. Ki-67 demonstrated a low proliferative index. Four-color in situ hybridization and fusion analysis for 104 using targeted RNA sequencing related genes did not reveal any gene rearrangements including PRKCA and PRKAR1A. Targeted mutation analysis for over 50 cancer-related genes showed GNA11 c.626A>T p.Q209L oncogenic mutation. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) cluster analysis were performed as described above.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:

The patient is advised to follow up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and management of the pigmented lesion. Methylation profiling of tumors offers highly efficient and reliable information for classification of tumors and future studies aiming to explore the optimal use of this technique will warrant improved diagnostic and management approaches for pigmented lesions when there is a concern for malignancy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

Pigmented lesion with rare mitotic figures and multiple microscopic satellites.</span></div></div>

Patient Name: Not provided
Age: 61 years 
Gender: Not provided
Admission Date: Not provided
Discharge Date: Not provided
Admitting Diagnosis: Confirmed COVID-19 

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to a different hospital due to a productive cough and required invasive assisted ventilation shortly after admission. She was later transferred to a tertiary care hospital for kinetic therapy and continuous renal replacement therapy due to oliguric acute kidney injury. Venovenous ECMO therapy was initiated due to progressive hypoxemia. The patient's nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. After tracheotomy and weaning, ECMO therapy and invasive assisted ventilation were no longer required, but the patient still needed intermittent renal replacement therapy.

During the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before the clinical appearance of jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels, but sustained synthetic liver function reflected by international normalized ratio (INR) and serum albumin measurements. A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by ERCP, showing intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts. In addition, the patient received drugs that have previously been associated with SSC. Plasma levels of bilirubin and ammonia gradually increased after that, with stable liver synthesis reflected by normal values of the INR without substituting coagulation factors.

The patient developed progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion as the disease progressed. Hepatic encephalopathy was treated but clinical symptoms worsened. Hemadsorption using the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device was used in combination with IRRT to eliminate bilirubin, ammonia, and CRP levels while serum albumin levels remained stable. Direct comparison revealed that bilirubin was less efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption compared to ammonia. During the successful elimination of bilirubin and ammonia, clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved. Following a continuation of IRRT but termination of hemadsorption therapy, bilirubin and ammonia levels increased again, worsening clinical symptoms within 20 days. The patient suddenly died due to cardiac arrhythmia before liver transplantation evaluation was initiated. 

Discharge Diagnosis:

The patient passed away due to cardiac arrhythmia. 

Discharge Condition:

Deceased. 

Follow-up:

The patient requires no further follow-up. 

Attending Physician:

The attending physician was not named in the case report.</span></div></div>

Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]

Clinical Course:
The patient is a 15-year-old male who presented with severe Tourette syndrome and comorbid anxiety and depression. The patient's tic onset occurred at 9 years of age and has worsened over time, leading to coprolalia and near-continuous simple and complex motor tics. Despite multiple medication trials, including escitalopram, benztropine, clonazepam, clonidine, sertraline, haloperidol, risperidone, guanfacine, and aripiprazole, all at maximum dose for more than 4 weeks, the patient did not respond to treatment. Haloperidol treatment was discontinued due to an acute dystonic reaction, which was diagnosed by a pediatric movement disorder specialist.

The patient and his family elected to proceed with implantation of temporary depth electrodes at 12 sites for testing of approximately 4-7 days since the optimal deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for Tourettes syndrome is unknown. The presurgical work-up showed no abnormalities or contraindications to surgical intervention.

After the patient completed the testing, he was discharged on [Date] with a follow-up appointment on [Date]. The patient's discharge plan also included starting a new medication trial and continued mental health counseling. The patient was advised to continue psychotherapy and to follow up with the prescribing physician every 2 weeks to assess response to medication and address any reported side effects.</span></div></div>
