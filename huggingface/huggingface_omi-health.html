He's 13 years old now.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.&quot;},&quot;soap&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;S: The patient's mother reports that her 13-year-old son has mild to moderate speech and developmental delays and has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. She denies any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia. The patient also exhibits certain physical characteristics, including retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, an elongated philtrum, thin upper lip, broad and short hands, mild syndactyly of the second and third toes, and a sandal gap in both feet.\nO: An MRI of the brain showed no structural anomalies. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed a de novo frameshift variant Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)), indicating a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nA: The primary diagnosis is a genetic disorder associated with the identified frameshift mutation, which likely contributes to the patient's speech and developmental delays and attention deficit disorder.

He's 13 years old now.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\\nPatient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\\n[After the tests]\\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results.

However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. \\nPatient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?\\nDoctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.\\nPatient: How long will the treatment last?\\nDoctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks.

I came here because for the past 2 months, I've been experiencing fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. I don't have fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, itching, or any urinary or bowel problems.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you please tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Sure. I was diagnosed with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis of the mediastinal lymph nodes 9 years ago. I had hilar lymphadenopathy seen on a routine chest radiography back then. The disease has been inactive, and I've never had symptoms related to it or received any treatment. I also have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention performed a month before this presentation, and recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, lamotrigine, clopidogrel, metformin, rosuvastatin, and sildenafil.\\nDoctor: Do you have a history of alcohol or tobacco use?\\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of alcohol or tobacco use. I used to work as a secretary.\\nDoctor: Alright. Let's perform a physical examination. *After examination* Your vital signs are normal. Your body mass index is 37.2 kg/m2, and your weight is 263 pounds. The general, lung, heart, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, and there's no palpable lymphadenopathy.\\nDoctor: We need to perform a battery of laboratory tests to further investigate your symptoms. *After tests* Your alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels are within normal limits. However, your alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are elevated (ALP = 258 U/L, reference = 38-126 U/L; GGT = 274 U/L, reference = 12-73 U/L). You also have hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0-1.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0\\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, doctor?\\nDoctor: These elevated levels indicate that there might be an issue with your liver function. We will need to further investigate the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your symptoms.\\nPatient: Okay, doctor. What should I do for follow-up?\\nDoctor: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can discuss the results of additional testing and determine the best course of action for your treatment.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.\nPatient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?\nDoctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.\nPatient D: Alright, I see.

It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.\nPatient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?\nDoctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision.

Just here for a regular check-up.\\nDoctor: That's good to hear. I see that you are a 60-year-old African American male and currently asymptomatic. I also noticed that your 62-year-old brother had prostate cancer and was successfully treated with radiation. Is that correct?\\nPatient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.\\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.\\nPatient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?\\nDoctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.\\nPatient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?\\nDoctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.\\nPatient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?\\nDoctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.\\nPatient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?\\nDoctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.\\nPatient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.\\nDoctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.\\nPatient D: Thank you, doc. I appreciate your help and guidance.\\nDoctor: You're welcome, Patient D. I look forward to our next discussion. Take care and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\\nPatient D: Will do. Thanks again, and see you soon.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;role\&quot;: \&quot;assistant\&quot;,\n    \&quot;content\&quot;: \&quot;S: Patient D, a 60-year-old African American male, reports no current symptoms and is visiting for a routine check-up. He has a family history significant for prostate cancer, as his 62-year-old brother was diagnosed and treated with radiation.\\nO: Patient is currently asymptomatic. No physical examination findings or laboratory results were discussed during the consultation.\\nA: Patient D is at an increased risk for prostate cancer due to his ethnicity and family history (first-degree relative diagnosed before age 65). The discussion focused on the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, considering varying recommendations from different health organizations.\\nP: Plan to have a detailed conversation about PSA testing to allow Patient D to make an informed decision.

Can you please tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having irregular periods and noticed some excessive hair growth on my body.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Our physical examination did reveal hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. I also noticed in your medical history that you had an intramural myoma myomectomy operation through laparotomy, as well as disc hernia and peptic ulcer. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I understand you've been married for 7 years and have undergone intrauterine insemination twice. We performed a chromosome analysis on your peripheral blood, and it revealed a marker chromosome: 47XX+m. \nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: In the ultrasonography examination, we observed a polycystic ovary appearance, but your uterus and endometrium were found to be normal. Based on these findings, our diagnosis is coherent with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. \nPatient: I had a feeling that might be the case.\nDoctor: On the second day of your menstruation, we performed a hormonal analysis. The results were as follows: AMH- 6.4 ng / mL; Estradiol- 52.23 pg / mL; FSH- 6.16 mIU / mL; Lh- 21.22 mIU / mL; Prolactin- 10.35 ng / mL and TSH- 0.99 μIU / mL. Your semen analysis was normal.\nPatient: That's good to know.\nDoctor: Your current body weight is 64 kg, and your BMI is 25 kg / m2. After a genetic consultation, taking into account your polycystic ovary appearance, recurrent miscarriages, and marker chromosome, we are considering in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis as a potential plan for you.\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean exactly?\nDoctor: It means that we'll create embryos through IVF and then perform a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to identify any potential genetic issues before implanting the embryos. This can help reduce the risk of miscarriages and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. What are the next steps?\nDoctor: The next steps will involve scheduling appointments for additional testing, monitoring your hormone levels, and starting the IVF process. Our team will be with you every step of the way to provide guidance and support.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Can you please tell me about your history with acromegaly and any recent symptoms you've had?\nPatient: Yeah, I was admitted to the hospital because I've been having shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 years. I also had an episode of presyncope about 2 weeks ago but didn't get any further evaluation.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have any family history of diseases or any past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, or sudden cardiac death?\nPatient: No, I don't have any family history of diseases, and I haven't had any of those conditions myself either. I don't smoke or drink alcohol too.\nDoctor: Good to know. I understand you've had stereotactic radiosurgeries twice in the past decade, and you've been following treatment with a somatostatin analog, octreotide, through intramuscular injections for about 20 years now?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Alright. I noticed that you are overweight and moderately nourished. Your height is 1.85 m (73 inches), and you weigh 134 kg, giving you a body mass index of 39 kg/m2. Your blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, and your heart rate is 92 beats/min with sinus rhythm. You also have some distinct skeletal features, like enlargement of the tongue and lip, as well as large hands and feet. \nPatient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed that too.\nDoctor: During the cardiac auscultation, we observed irregular premature beats, a pathological third heart sound, and a systolic murmur over the apex and aortic area. We also noted bilateral extensive borders of cardiac dullness. Your physiological reflexes are present without any pathology. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with a wide QRS duration of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Based on this, your condition is classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III–IV.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't know it was that serious.\nDoctor: On admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a pituitary macroadenoma. Given your symptoms, we also ran blood tests for myocardial injury markers, which revealed an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level of 740 pg/ml, indicating cardiac failure.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, hormone laboratory tests demonstrated excessive secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1. We'll need to closely monitor your condition and discuss possible treatment options to manage these issues.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

Can you tell me about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically.

Can you tell me about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum.

There's no pain and no limitation of movement, but it's really annoying.\nDoctor: I see. What have you done to manage the swelling?\nPatient: Well, I usually have a puncture and drainage of the joint when it swells up.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?\nPatient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.\nDoctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?\nPatient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.\nDoctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?\nPatient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.\nDoctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.\nDoctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/μL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL. Your antinuclear antibody was borderline, but autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?\nDoctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?\nDoctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your sJIA and keep you as comfortable as possible.

The patient has a history of intermittent high fever and bilateral knee and right ankle swelling one month prior to admission. The patient has been managing the swelling with puncture and drainage and started taking aspirin for the symptoms, which did not alleviate the intermittent fever.\nO: Physical examination revealed no skin rash or eye involvement. MRI showed a small amount of fluid in the joint space without synovitis. Laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count (9,000/μL), elevated C-reactive protein (15.65 mg/dL), and elevated serum immunoglobulin G (2,569 mg/dL). Antinuclear antibody was borderline; autoantibodies including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative, as was rheumatoid factor. Blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.\nA: The patient was diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) based on clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings, ruling out other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions due to the absence of specific autoantibodies and family history.\nP: Treatment initiated with bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). The patient's fever has responded to this regimen.

Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?\nPatient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.\nDoctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?\nPatient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.\nDoctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?\nPatient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.\nDoctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.\nDoctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/μL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL. Your antinuclear antibody was borderline, but autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?\nDoctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?\nDoctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your sJIA and keep you as comfortable as possible.

You underwent laparotomy and detwisting sigmoidopexy, followed by elective sigmoidectomy. Can you tell me about your current symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, about 2 months ago, I started having abdominal distension, constipation, and vomiting for 3 days. Then, I had severe abdominal pain for a day. I've also had some recurrent constipation, but I didn't bother to seek medical advice and just used over the counter or traditional medications.\nDoctor: I understand. What about your family, drug, or social history? Any significant events or issues?\nPatient: No, nothing significant. I've been pretty healthy overall.\nDoctor: Alright. During your examination, it was noted that you looked ill but not pale, jaundiced, or febrile. Your pulse rate was 104 beats per minute, blood pressure was 110/70, respiratory rate was 22 cycles per minute, and your temperature was 38.8°C.

A digital rectal examination revealed a 3rd degree pile and an empty rectum. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Your blood tests showed an Hb of 13 g/dl, WBCs of 14 × 109 per liter, and PLTs count of 305 × 109 per liter. Your renal profile and serum electrolytes were within the normal range. Blood glucose was 193 mg/dl, and your urine examination was unremarkable. An abdominal X-ray showed a typically dilated omega-shaped colon. The diagnosis of a strangulated bowel obstruction was considered, with adhesive type as the top differential. However, recurrent or other site volvulus was a remote possibility despite the X-ray findings.\nPatient: So, what's the next step, doc?\nDoctor: After optimizing your general condition with an NG tube suction and intravenous fluids resuscitation, you will need to undergo further treatment. We will closely monitor your condition and decide the best course of action to address the bowel obstruction.\nPatient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's do what's necessary to get me back on track.\nDoctor: Thank you for your trust. We will do our best to help you through this process.

I became unresponsive, so he started cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nDoctor: I see. It seems that you were in a pulseless electrical activity arrest. How long did it take for the emergency medical service to arrive?\nPatient: It took them around 10 minutes to get there after my husband started CPR.\nDoctor: During that time, you were given two doses of epinephrine before achieving return of spontaneous circulation. You were then taken to an outside hospital. At the hospital, you were hypotensive with a blood pressure of 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor infusion. You also had expiratory wheezing, needing continuous nebulizer treatment. Your initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of < 6.8, carbon dioxide of 130 mmHg, and oxygen of 331 mmHg.\nPatient: Yes, they gave me continuous albuterol treatments and made adjustments to the ventilator.\nDoctor: After those treatments, your repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 6.81, PaCO2 of 138 mmHg, and PaO2 of 262 mmHg. On examination, you were comatose with fixed and dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. You were then transferred to our facility for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\nPatient: Okay, so what happened when I arrived here?\nDoctor: Upon arrival, we sedated and paralyzed you to optimize ventilation and oxygenation prior to ECMO. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head, which showed diffuse cerebral edema, indicating a severe anoxic brain injury.\nPatient: Oh no, what was done after that?\nDoctor: You were evaluated by our neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) team. They administered mannitol (100 g) and 23.4% (30 cc) to help with the cerebral edema, but there was no change in your neurological examination. We initiated veno-venous (V-V) ECMO with a flow of 4 LPM, speed of 3215 RPM, and FiO2 of 100% to support your oxygenation.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now, doc?\nDoctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust the ECMO settings as needed.

I became unresponsive, so he started cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\\nDoctor: I see. It seems that you were in a pulseless electrical activity arrest. How long did it take for the emergency medical service to arrive?\\nPatient: It took them around 10 minutes to get there after my husband started CPR.\\nDoctor: During that time, you were given two doses of epinephrine before achieving return of spontaneous circulation. You were then taken to an outside hospital. At the hospital, you were hypotensive with a blood pressure of 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor infusion. You also had expiratory wheezing, needing continuous nebulizer treatment.

On examination, you were comatose with fixed and dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. You were then transferred to our facility for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\\nPatient: Okay, so what happened when I arrived here?\\nDoctor: Upon arrival, we sedated and paralyzed you to optimize ventilation and oxygenation prior to ECMO.

How have you been since then? Any postpartum complications?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been doing well since the delivery. No complications, thankfully.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. As part of our ongoing study on \&quot;Vaginal delivery after caesarean section\&quot;, you underwent a saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The results showed a small indentation in your caesarean scar, and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ). \nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my current pregnancy?\nDoctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.\nDoctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.\nPatient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.\nDoctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.\nPatient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?\nDoctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?\nDoctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.\nPatient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. You'll be admitted to the labor ward when the time comes. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and reach out if you have any concerns.

Any postpartum complications?\\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been doing well since the delivery. No complications, thankfully.\\nDoctor: That's good to hear. As part of our ongoing study on \\\&quot;Vaginal delivery after caesarean section\\\&quot;, you underwent a saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The results showed a small indentation in your caesarean scar, and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ). \\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my current pregnancy?\\nDoctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.\\nDoctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.\\nPatient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.\\nDoctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.\\nPatient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?\\nDoctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).\\nPatient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?\\nDoctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.\\nPatient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. You'll be admitted to the labor ward when the time comes. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and reach out if you have any concerns. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.\\nPatient: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;role\&quot;: \&quot;assistant\&quot;,\n    \&quot;content\&quot;: \&quot;S: The patient, a postpartum woman with a history of emergency caesarean delivery at 39 weeks due to fetal distress, reports no postpartum complications. She is currently pregnant and has been asymptomatic throughout. She underwent saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months post-caesarean, revealing a small indentation in the scar with 7.5 mm of remaining myometrium. A duplex pregnancy was identified at 13 weeks with one viable intrauterine fetus and a small gestational sac in the caesarean scar, which was asymptomatic and non-vascular.\\nO: Previous imaging showed a small indentation in the caesarean scar and a duplex pregnancy with one intrauterine fetus. Follow-up ultrasounds at 18, 22, and 30 weeks showed no ectopic gestational sac and unchanged scar niche. The thickness of the lower uterine segment at 30 weeks was 4.9 mm, indicating no contraindications for vaginal delivery.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is a successful intrauterine pregnancy post-caesarean section with a previous history of a caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy that resolved without intervention. The patient remains a candidate for vaginal delivery, considering the normal development of the intrauterine pregnancy and stable condition of the caesarean scar.\\nP: The plan includes expectant management with a scheduled vaginal delivery. The labor ward staff has been informed and prepared for the patient's case. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and contact healthcare providers if concerns arise. Regular prenatal care will continue to monitor the health of the mother and fetus.\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:9250,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODY1Miwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL29taS1oZWFsdGgvbWVkaWNhbC1kaWFsb2d1ZS10by1zb2FwLXN1bW1hcnkiLCJleHAiOjE3NDI5MjIyNTIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHVnZ2luZ2ZhY2UuY28ifQ.rcPKxp9WgFCh0C9TwxjGGpaKum352JtwdeO1oX6fjE7InhlasNLlLvhw99UGdPgWegKoymaTFNQjzRq7KlhLCA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;omi-health/medical-dialogue-to-soap-summary&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64d15c847e20ec9ea0f26498/l4A-Yq4NlNKj1H-dvTFCP.png&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Omi&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;omi-health&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:true,&quot;followerCount&quot;:12},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

Patient: My son has been having some issues with speech and development. He's 13 years old now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?
Patient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. 
(After the tests)
Doctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?
Patient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.
Doctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.
Patient: What does that mean for my son?
Doctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.
Patient: What should we do for follow-up?
Doctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.</span></div></div>

She denies any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia. The patient also exhibits certain physical characteristics, including retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, an elongated philtrum, thin upper lip, broad and short hands, mild syndactyly of the second and third toes, and a sandal gap in both feet.
O: An MRI of the brain showed no structural anomalies. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed a de novo frameshift variant Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)), indicating a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.
A: The primary diagnosis is a genetic disorder associated with the identified frameshift mutation, which likely contributes to the patient's speech and developmental delays and attention deficit disorder. The physical characteristics and genetic findings suggest a specific syndrome, which needs further correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling.
P: The management plan includes regular follow-up visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist to support the patient's developmental needs and address his attention deficit disorder. Regular medical check-ups will monitor his growth and overall health. Genetic counseling for the family is also recommended to discuss the implications of the genetic findings and potential familial inheritance.</span></div></div>

He's 13 years old now.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress."

Patient: Hi, my 21-month-old son has been experiencing weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain after a mild upper respiratory tract infection.
Doctor: I see. Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?
Patient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.
Doctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.
Doctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. 
Patient: Okay, thank you.
[After the tests]
Doctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.
Patient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?
Doctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. 
Patient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?
Doctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.
Patient: How long will the treatment last?
Doctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
[After 3 weeks of therapy]
Doctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.
Patient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?
Doctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary. In the meantime, it's important for you to keep an eye on any changes in his symptoms and report them to us immediately. We'll do our best to help him recover.

Patient: Hi, doctor. I came here because for the past 2 months, I've been experiencing fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. I don't have fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, itching, or any urinary or bowel problems.
Doctor: I see. Can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis of the mediastinal lymph nodes 9 years ago. I had hilar lymphadenopathy seen on a routine chest radiography back then. The disease has been inactive, and I've never had symptoms related to it or received any treatment. I also have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention performed a month before this presentation, and recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, lamotrigine, clopidogrel, metformin, rosuvastatin, and sildenafil.
Doctor: Do you have a history of alcohol or tobacco use?
Patient: No, I don't have any history of alcohol or tobacco use. I used to work as a secretary.
Doctor: Alright. Let's perform a physical examination. *After examination* Your vital signs are normal. Your body mass index is 37.2 kg/m2, and your weight is 263 pounds. The general, lung, heart, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, and there's no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Doctor: We need to perform a battery of laboratory tests to further investigate your symptoms. *After tests* Your alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels are within normal limits. However, your alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are elevated (ALP = 258 U/L, reference = 38-126 U/L; GGT = 274 U/L, reference = 12-73 U/L). You also have hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0-1.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: These elevated levels indicate that there might be an issue with your liver function. We will need to further investigate the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, doctor. What should I do for follow-up?
Doctor: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can discuss the results of additional testing and determine the best course of action for your treatment.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll see you in two weeks.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and please reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your next appointment.</span></div></div>

I came here because for the past 2 months, I've been experiencing fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. I don't have fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, itching, or any urinary or bowel problems.\nDoctor: I see. Can you please tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: Sure. I was diagnosed with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis of the mediastinal lymph nodes 9 years ago. I had hilar lymphadenopathy seen on a routine chest radiography back then. The disease has been inactive, and I've never had symptoms related to it or received any treatment. I also have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention performed a month before this presentation, and recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\nPatient: I'm taking amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, lamotrigine, clopidogrel, metformin, rosuvastatin, and sildenafil.\nDoctor: Do you have a history of alcohol or tobacco use?\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of alcohol or tobacco use. I used to work as a secretary.\nDoctor: Alright. Let's perform a physical examination. *After examination* Your vital signs are normal. Your body mass index is 37.2 kg/m2, and your weight is 263 pounds. The general, lung, heart, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, and there's no palpable lymphadenopathy.\nDoctor: We need to perform a battery of laboratory tests to further investigate your symptoms. *After tests* Your alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels are within normal limits. However, your alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are elevated (ALP = 258 U/L, reference = 38-126 U/L; GGT = 274 U/L, reference = 12-73 U/L). You also have hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0-1.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: These elevated levels indicate that there might be an issue with your liver function. We will need to further investigate the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, doctor. What should I do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can discuss the results of additional testing and determine the best course of action for your treatment.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I'll see you in two weeks.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and please reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your next appointment."

How are you feeling today?
Patient D: I'm feeling fine, doc, no complaints. Just here for a regular check-up.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I see that you are a 60-year-old African American male and currently asymptomatic. I also noticed that your 62-year-old brother had prostate cancer and was successfully treated with radiation. Is that correct?
Patient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.
Patient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?
Doctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.
Patient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?
Doctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.
Patient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?
Doctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.
Patient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?
Doctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.
Patient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.
Doctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.
Patient D: Thank you, doc. I appreciate your help and guidance.
Doctor: You're welcome, Patient D. I look forward to our next discussion. Take care and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Can you please tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having irregular periods and noticed some excessive hair growth on my body.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Our physical examination did reveal hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. I also noticed in your medical history that you had an intramural myoma myomectomy operation through laparotomy, as well as disc hernia and peptic ulcer. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: I understand you've been married for 7 years and have undergone intrauterine insemination twice. We performed a chromosome analysis on your peripheral blood, and it revealed a marker chromosome: 47XX+m. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: In the ultrasonography examination, we observed a polycystic ovary appearance, but your uterus and endometrium were found to be normal. Based on these findings, our diagnosis is coherent with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. 
Patient: I had a feeling that might be the case.
Doctor: On the second day of your menstruation, we performed a hormonal analysis. The results were as follows: AMH- 6.4 ng / mL; Estradiol- 52.23 pg / mL; FSH- 6.16 mIU / mL; Lh- 21.22 mIU / mL; Prolactin- 10.35 ng / mL and TSH- 0.99 μIU / mL. Your semen analysis was normal.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: Your current body weight is 64 kg, and your BMI is 25 kg / m2. After a genetic consultation, taking into account your polycystic ovary appearance, recurrent miscarriages, and marker chromosome, we are considering in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis as a potential plan for you.
Patient: Okay, what does that mean exactly?
Doctor: It means that we'll create embryos through IVF and then perform a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to identify any potential genetic issues before implanting the embryos. This can help reduce the risk of miscarriages and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. What are the next steps?
Doctor: The next steps will involve scheduling appointments for additional testing, monitoring your hormone levels, and starting the IVF process. Our team will be with you every step of the way to provide guidance and support.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process.</span></div></div>

She has a history of two early miscarriages, intrauterine insemination attempts, intramural myoma myomectomy, disc hernia, and peptic ulcer. She expressed concerns about her symptoms and potential diagnosis.
O: Physical examination confirmed hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. Chromosome analysis showed 47XX+m. Ultrasonography revealed polycystic ovaries with normal uterus and endometrium. Hormonal analysis results were: AMH- 6.4 ng/mL, Estradiol- 52.23 pg/mL, FSH- 6.16 mIU/mL, LH- 21.22 mIU/mL, Prolactin- 10.35 ng/mL, and TSH- 0.99 μIU/mL. Semen analysis was normal. Current body weight is 64 kg, BMI 25 kg/m2.
A: The primary diagnosis is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), supported by clinical findings of hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. The presence of a marker chromosome and history of recurrent miscarriages suggest a genetic component to her infertility.
P: The management plan includes proceeding with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis to address genetic concerns and enhance the probability of a successful pregnancy. The patient will undergo further hormonal monitoring and genetic counseling. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Can you please tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having irregular periods and noticed some excessive hair growth on my body.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Our physical examination did reveal hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. I also noticed in your medical history that you had an intramural myoma myomectomy operation through laparotomy, as well as disc hernia and peptic ulcer. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I understand you've been married for 7 years and have undergone intrauterine insemination twice. We performed a chromosome analysis on your peripheral blood, and it revealed a marker chromosome: 47XX+m. \nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: In the ultrasonography examination, we observed a polycystic ovary appearance, but your uterus and endometrium were found to be normal. Based on these findings, our diagnosis is coherent with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. \nPatient: I had a feeling that might be the case.\nDoctor: On the second day of your menstruation, we performed a hormonal analysis. The results were as follows: AMH- 6.4 ng / mL; Estradiol- 52.23 pg / mL; FSH- 6.16 mIU / mL; Lh- 21.22 mIU / mL; Prolactin- 10.35 ng / mL and TSH- 0.99 μIU / mL. Your semen analysis was normal.\nPatient: That's good to know.\nDoctor: Your current body weight is 64 kg, and your BMI is 25 kg / m2. After a genetic consultation, taking into account your polycystic ovary appearance, recurrent miscarriages, and marker chromosome, we are considering in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis as a potential plan for you.\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean exactly?\nDoctor: It means that we'll create embryos through IVF and then perform a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to identify any potential genetic issues before implanting the embryos. This can help reduce the risk of miscarriages and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. What are the next steps?\nDoctor: The next steps will involve scheduling appointments for additional testing, monitoring your hormone levels, and starting the IVF process. Our team will be with you every step of the way to provide guidance and support.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Patient: Yeah, I was admitted to the hospital because I've been having shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 years. I also had an episode of presyncope about 2 weeks ago but didn't get any further evaluation.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any family history of diseases or any past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, or sudden cardiac death?
Patient: No, I don't have any family history of diseases, and I haven't had any of those conditions myself either. I don't smoke or drink alcohol too.
Doctor: Good to know. I understand you've had stereotactic radiosurgeries twice in the past decade, and you've been following treatment with a somatostatin analog, octreotide, through intramuscular injections for about 20 years now?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. I noticed that you are overweight and moderately nourished. Your height is 1.85 m (73 inches), and you weigh 134 kg, giving you a body mass index of 39 kg/m2. Your blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, and your heart rate is 92 beats/min with sinus rhythm. You also have some distinct skeletal features, like enlargement of the tongue and lip, as well as large hands and feet. 
Patient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed that too.
Doctor: During the cardiac auscultation, we observed irregular premature beats, a pathological third heart sound, and a systolic murmur over the apex and aortic area. We also noted bilateral extensive borders of cardiac dullness. Your physiological reflexes are present without any pathology. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with a wide QRS duration of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Based on this, your condition is classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III–IV.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know it was that serious.
Doctor: On admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a pituitary macroadenoma. Given your symptoms, we also ran blood tests for myocardial injury markers, which revealed an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level of 740 pg/ml, indicating cardiac failure.
Patient: That doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Additionally, hormone laboratory tests demonstrated excessive secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1. We'll need to closely monitor your condition and discuss possible treatment options to manage these issues.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to manage your condition and help you feel better. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.</span></div></div>

Can you tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.
Doctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum. Invasion of the venous, lymphatic vessels, and perineural sites was seen. However, no further spread was detected.
Patient: What are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your recovery and discuss any further treatments or follow-up requirements with you. It's important to keep us informed about any changes in your symptoms or condition.

Can you tell me about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum. Invasion of the venous, lymphatic vessels, and perineural sites was seen. However, no further spread was detected.\nPatient: What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your recovery and discuss any further treatments or follow-up requirements with you. It's important to keep us informed about any changes in your symptoms or condition.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Patient: Hi, I've been suffering from right ankle swelling since I was 7 years old. There's no pain and no limitation of movement, but it's really annoying.
Doctor: I see. What have you done to manage the swelling?
Patient: Well, I usually have a puncture and drainage of the joint when it swells up.
Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.
Doctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?
Patient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.
Doctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?
Patient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.
Doctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?
Patient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.
Doctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/μL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL. Your antinuclear antibody was borderline, but autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.
Patient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?
Doctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.
Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?
Doctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.
Patient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?
Doctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your sJIA and keep you as comfortable as possible. Let's stay in touch and monitor your progress.</span></div></div>

You underwent laparotomy and detwisting sigmoidopexy, followed by elective sigmoidectomy. Can you tell me about your current symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, about 2 months ago, I started having abdominal distension, constipation, and vomiting for 3 days. Then, I had severe abdominal pain for a day. I've also had some recurrent constipation, but I didn't bother to seek medical advice and just used over the counter or traditional medications.
Doctor: I understand. What about your family, drug, or social history? Any significant events or issues?
Patient: No, nothing significant. I've been pretty healthy overall.
Doctor: Alright. During your examination, it was noted that you looked ill but not pale, jaundiced, or febrile. Your pulse rate was 104 beats per minute, blood pressure was 110/70, respiratory rate was 22 cycles per minute, and your temperature was 38.8°C. Your abdomen was grossly distended with full flanks, a midline scar, visible dilated bowel loop, and peristalsis. There was tenderness all over the abdomen, and no bowel sounds were detected. A digital rectal examination revealed a 3rd degree pile and an empty rectum. 
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Your blood tests showed an Hb of 13 g/dl, WBCs of 14 × 109 per liter, and PLTs count of 305 × 109 per liter. Your renal profile and serum electrolytes were within the normal range. Blood glucose was 193 mg/dl, and your urine examination was unremarkable. An abdominal X-ray showed a typically dilated omega-shaped colon. The diagnosis of a strangulated bowel obstruction was considered, with adhesive type as the top differential. However, recurrent or other site volvulus was a remote possibility despite the X-ray findings.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: After optimizing your general condition with an NG tube suction and intravenous fluids resuscitation, you will need to undergo further treatment. We will closely monitor your condition and decide the best course of action to address the bowel obstruction.
Patient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's do what's necessary to get me back on track.

The patient also reports recurrent constipation treated with over-the-counter and traditional medications. No significant family, drug, or social history was reported.
O: Physical examination revealed the patient appeared ill but not pale, jaundiced, or febrile. Vital signs included a pulse rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 cycles per minute, and a temperature of 38.8°C. The abdomen was grossly distended with full flanks, a midline scar, visible dilated bowel loop, and peristalsis, with tenderness throughout and no bowel sounds. A digital rectal examination showed a 3rd degree pile and an empty rectum. Laboratory findings showed Hb 13 g/dl, WBCs 14 × 109/L, PLTs 305 × 109/L, normal renal profile and serum electrolytes, blood glucose 193 mg/dl, and unremarkable urine examination. Abdominal X-ray revealed a typically dilated omega-shaped colon.
A: The primary diagnosis is strangulated bowel obstruction, with adhesive type as the top differential diagnosis. Recurrent or other site volvulus is considered a remote possibility. The patient's symptoms and imaging are consistent with this assessment, and the history of previous abdominal surgeries increases the likelihood of adhesive obstruction.
P: Immediate management includes NG tube suction and intravenous fluids resuscitation to optimize the patient's general condition. Close monitoring of the patient's condition will be necessary to decide further treatment options for the bowel obstruction. Regular follow-ups and immediate reporting of any changes in symptoms or condition are advised to manage and adjust treatment as needed.</span></div></div>

Can you tell me more about your recent experience and what brought you to the emergency department?
Patient: Well, my husband found me on the couch in the morning with my nebulizer in hand. I became unresponsive, so he started cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Doctor: I see. It seems that you were in a pulseless electrical activity arrest. How long did it take for the emergency medical service to arrive?
Patient: It took them around 10 minutes to get there after my husband started CPR.
Doctor: During that time, you were given two doses of epinephrine before achieving return of spontaneous circulation. You were then taken to an outside hospital. At the hospital, you were hypotensive with a blood pressure of 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor infusion. You also had expiratory wheezing, needing continuous nebulizer treatment. Your initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of &lt; 6.8, carbon dioxide of 130 mmHg, and oxygen of 331 mmHg.
Patient: Yes, they gave me continuous albuterol treatments and made adjustments to the ventilator.
Doctor: After those treatments, your repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 6.81, PaCO2 of 138 mmHg, and PaO2 of 262 mmHg. On examination, you were comatose with fixed and dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. You were then transferred to our facility for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Patient: Okay, so what happened when I arrived here?
Doctor: Upon arrival, we sedated and paralyzed you to optimize ventilation and oxygenation prior to ECMO. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head, which showed diffuse cerebral edema, indicating a severe anoxic brain injury.
Patient: Oh no, what was done after that?
Doctor: You were evaluated by our neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) team. They administered mannitol (100 g) and 23.4% (30 cc) to help with the cerebral edema, but there was no change in your neurological examination. We initiated veno-venous (V-V) ECMO with a flow of 4 LPM, speed of 3215 RPM, and FiO2 of 100% to support your oxygenation.
Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust the ECMO settings as needed. Our team will also provide any necessary treatments and interventions to help improve your neurological function.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help you through this difficult time.

Doctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.
Patient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.
Doctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.
Patient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.
Doctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.
Patient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?
Doctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).
Patient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?
Doctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.
Patient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. You'll be admitted to the labor ward when the time comes. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and reach out if you have any concerns. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.
Patient: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.</span></div></div>

She is currently pregnant and has been asymptomatic throughout. She underwent saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months post-caesarean, revealing a small indentation in the scar with 7.5 mm of remaining myometrium. A duplex pregnancy was identified at 13 weeks with one viable intrauterine fetus and a small gestational sac in the caesarean scar, which was asymptomatic and non-vascular.
O: Previous imaging showed a small indentation in the caesarean scar and a duplex pregnancy with one intrauterine fetus. Follow-up ultrasounds at 18, 22, and 30 weeks showed no ectopic gestational sac and unchanged scar niche. The thickness of the lower uterine segment at 30 weeks was 4.9 mm, indicating no contraindications for vaginal delivery.
A: The primary diagnosis is a successful intrauterine pregnancy post-caesarean section with a previous history of a caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy that resolved without intervention. The patient remains a candidate for vaginal delivery, considering the normal development of the intrauterine pregnancy and stable condition of the caesarean scar.
P: The plan includes expectant management with a scheduled vaginal delivery. The labor ward staff has been informed and prepared for the patient's case. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and contact healthcare providers if concerns arise. Regular prenatal care will continue to monitor the health of the mother and fetus.</span></div></div>

		Abstract
	</span>
</h3>
<p>This dataset consists of 10,000 synthetic dialogues between a patient and clinician, created using the GPT-4 dataset from NoteChat, based on PubMed Central (PMC) case-reports. Accompanying these dialogues are SOAP summaries generated through GPT-4. The dataset is split into 9250 training, 500 validation, and 250 test entries, each containing a dialogue column, a SOAP column, a prompt column, and a ChatML-style conversation format column.</p>
