The French also sought to expand their influence in the Mediterranean and to counterbalance the growing power of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Morocco nominally was ruled by its sultan, the young Abd al-Aziz, through his regent, Ba Ahmed.

The French Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé saw the opportunity to stabilize the situation and expand the French overseas empire.\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the main reasons behind the French's desire to expand their overseas empire?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The French saw Morocco as a strategic location for their imperial ambitions in Africa and the Middle East. The country's location on the Mediterranean, its rich mineral resources, and its proximity to Europe made it an ideal candidate for French colonization. Additionally, the French saw Morocco as a potential gateway to Africa and the Middle East, which could provide them with access to valuable resources and markets.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;General Hubert Lyautey wanted a more aggressive military policy using his French army based in Algeria. France decided to use both diplomacy and military force. The French colonial authorities would establish control over the Sultan, ruling in his name and extending French influence. The British acceded to any French designs in Morocco in the Entente Cordiale of 1904. The Germans, however, who had no established presence in the region, strongly protested against the French plan. The Kaiser's dramatic intervention in Morocco in March 1905 in support of Moroccan independence became a turning point on the road to the First World War. The international Algeciras Conference of 1906 formalized France's \&quot;special position\&quot; and entrusted policing of Morocco jointly to France and Spain.

The drought was particularly severe in the 1906-1907 period, leading to a decline in agricultural production and food availability. Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, a Moroccan nationalist leader, led an insurrection in 1905, which further contributed to the food shortages and the famine.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In 1907, the French took the murder of Émile Mauchamp in Marrakesh as a pretext to invade Oujda in the east, as they took an uprising against their appropriation of customs revenue in Casablanca as an opportunity to bombard and invade that city in the west.[132] Months later, there was a brief fratricidal civil war referred to as the Hafidiya, in which Abd al-Hafid, at first supported by southern aristocrats based in Marrakesh such as the Glawa [fr] and later conditionally supported by the ulama of Fes, wrested the throne from his brother Abd al-Aziz, who was supported by the French.[133][134]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the reasons behind the French invasion of Morocco in 1907?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The French invaded Morocco in 1907 due to a combination of factors, including the Hafidiya civil war, which was supported by southern aristocrats based in Marrakesh, and the French desire to gain control of Morocco's customs revenue in Casablanca. The French also wanted to establish a foothold in North Africa and gain access to its natural resources, including oil and phosphate. Additionally, the French viewed Morocco as a potential threat to their Mediterranean dominance, and saw the country as a potential ally in their rivalry with the British.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Agadir Crisis increased tensions among the powerful European countries,[135] and resulted in the Treaty of Fez (signed on 30 March 1912), which made Morocco a protectorate of France.[136][137] A second treaty signed by the French and Spanish heads of state, Spain was granted a Zone of influence in northern and southern Morocco on 27 November 1912. The northern part became the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, while the southern part was ruled from El Aaiun as a buffer zone between the Spanish Colony of Saguia El Hamra and Morocco.[138] The treaty of Fez triggered the 1912 Fez riots. By the Tangier Protocol signed in December 1923, Tangier received special status and became an international zone,[139] although, during World War II, it was occupied from 1940 to 1945 by Francoist Spain.\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the consequences of the Agadir Crisis and the Treaty of Fez for Morocco?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The consequences of the Agadir Crisis and the Treaty of Fez for Morocco were significant. The Treaty of Fez resulted in Morocco becoming a protectorate of France, and the country's territory was divided into two parts: the northern part became a Spanish protectorate, while the southern part was ruled from El Aaiun as a buffer zone between the Spanish Colony of Saguia El Hamra and Morocco. This division had significant impacts on the country's history and politics, leading to tensions between Morocco and Spain, as well as between Morocco and France. The consequences of the 1912 Fez riots were also significant, as they led to the death of many Moroccans and further strained relations between Morocco and France.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The assassination of Émile Mauchamp March 1907, which precipitated the French invasion of Oujda and the conquest of Morocco.\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What was the immediate cause of the assassination of Émile Mauchamp?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The assassination of Émile Mauchamp was carried out by a Moroccan nationalist, who believed that the French were exploiting the country's resources and oppressing its people.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Uprisings in Casablanca in July 1907 over the application terms of the Treaty of Algeciras led to the Bombardment of Casablanca.\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the terms of the Treaty of Algeciras?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The Treaty of Algeciras was signed on July 17, 1906, between Morocco and France.

As \&quot;pacification\&quot; proceeded, with the Zaian War and the War of the Rif, the French government focused on the exploitation of Morocco's mineral wealth, and particularly its phosphates; the creation of a modern transportation system with trains and buses; and the development of a modern agricultural sector geared to the French market.

This tension eventually led to the rise of nationalist political parties, which argued for Moroccan independence based on the Atlantic Charter and other declarations.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\nMany Moroccan Goumiers, or indigenous soldiers in the French army, assisted the Allies in both World War I and World War II.[151] During World War II, the badly divided nationalist movement became more cohesive. However, the nationalists belief that an Allied victory would pave the way for independence was disappointed.[citation needed] In January 1944, the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, which subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement, released a manifesto demanding full independence, national reunification, and a democratic constitution.[152] The Sultan Muhammad V (1927–1961) had approved the manifesto before its submission to the French resident general, who answered that no basic change in the protectorate status was being considered.[citation needed] The general sympathy of the sultan for the nationalists became evident by the end of the war, although he still hoped to see complete independence achieved gradually. On 10 April 1947, in spite of a massacre instigated by French forces in Casablanca,[153] Sultan Muhammad V delivered a momentous speech in Tangier appealing for independence and territorial unity of Morocco, having travelled from French Morocco and through Spanish Morocco to reach the Tangier International Zone.[154][155] The résidence, supported by French economic interests and vigorously backed by most of the colons, adamantly refused to consider even reforms short of independence.[citation needed]&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What was the main demand of the Moroccan nationalists during World War II?\n&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The main demand of the Moroccan nationalists during World War II was for full independence and territorial unity.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In December 1952, a riot broke out in Casablanca over the assassination of the Tunisian labour leader Farhat Hached; this event marked a watershed in relations between Moroccan political parties and French authorities.

As the French Foreign Minister Antoine Pinay had expressed, there was a willingness to grant Morocco its independence to \&quot;turn Morocco into a modern, democratic and sovereign state\&quot;.[165] In February 1956, Morocco acquired limited home rule.

The Moroccan nationalist movement, which had been gaining strength since the 1940s, had gained significant support from the French population.\n\n2. The French government was eager to end the Moroccan crisis and to maintain its influence in the region.\n\n3. The French Foreign Minister, Antoine Pinay, was willing to grant Morocco its independence to turn it into a modern, democratic and sovereign state.\n\n4.

It included provisions for the city of Tangier to be returned to Morocco's control, as well as the abolition of the Spanish protectorate. The protocol was signed on 29 October 1956, and the city was reintegrated with Morocco on 7 April 1956. The treaty also recognized Morocco's independence from Spain, and the two countries normalized their diplomatic relations. The Joint Declaration of April 1956 was a separate agreement between Morocco and Spain, which ended the Spanish protectorate over Morocco.

He acted cautiously, intent on preventing the Istiqlal from consolidating its control and establishing a one-party state. He assumed the monarchy on 11 August 1957, and from that date, the country officially became known as 'The Kingdom of Morocco'.[169][170]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What was the outcome of Mohammed V's cautious approach in establishing a modern governmental structure in Morocco?\n&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The outcome of Mohammed V's cautious approach was a stable and prosperous Morocco, which maintained a balance between the power of the monarchy and the Istiqlal.

His rule saw significant political unrest, and the ruthless government response earned the period the name \&quot;the years of lead\&quot;. Hassan took personal control of the government as prime minister and named a new cabinet. Aided by an advisory council, he drew up a new constitution, which was approved overwhelmingly in a December 1962 referendum. Under its provisions, the king remained the central figure in the executive branch of the government, but legislative power was vested in a bicameral parliament, and an independent judiciary was guaranteed.[171]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the significant political events that occurred during Hassan II's reign in Morocco?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: During Hassan II's reign, significant political events included the 1965 Casablanca Conference, which aimed to resolve the Western Sahara conflict, the 1970 constitutional referendum, which expanded the powers of the parliament and the 1972 constitutional amendment, which abolished the office of the prime minister and introduced a new electoral system.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In May 1963, legislative elections took place for the first time, and the royalist coalition secured a small plurality of seats. However, following a period of political upheaval in June 1965, Hassan II assumed full legislative and executive powers under a \&quot;state of exception,\&quot; which remained in effect until 1970. Subsequently, a reform constitution was approved, restoring limited parliamentary government, and new elections were held. However, dissent remained, revolving around complaints of widespread corruption and malfeasance in government. In July 1971 and again in August 1972, the regime was challenged by two attempted military coups.[172]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the key factors that led to the rise of Hassan II to power in Morocco?\n&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The key factors that led to the rise of Hassan II to power in Morocco were a combination of economic and political instability, widespread corruption and malfeasance in government, and the failure of the traditional political elite to provide effective leadership. The rise of Hassan II was also fueled by popular discontent with the existing system, which had been characterized by authoritarianism, corruption, and a lack of political freedom.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;After neighbouring Algeria's 1962 independence from France, border skirmishes in the Tindouf area of southwestern Algeria escalated in 1963 into what is known as the Sand War.

The conflict began after Morocco's King Hassan II sent troops to the Western Sahara in 1963, which Algeria viewed as an act of aggression. This led to a series of military and diplomatic escalations between the two countries, culminating in the 1964 Algiers Accords, which established a ceasefire and set the stage for eventual independence for the Western Sahara.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;On 3 March 1973, Hassan II announced the policy of Moroccanization, in which state-held assets, agricultural lands, and businesses that were more than 50 percent foreign-owned—and especially French-owned—were transferred to political loyalists and high-ranking military officers.[174][175] The Moroccanization of the economy affected thousands of businesses and the proportion of industrial businesses in Morocco that were Moroccan-owned immediately increased from 18% to 55%.[174] 2/3 of the wealth of the Moroccanized economy was concentrated in 36 Moroccan families.[174]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the immediate effects of Hassan II's Moroccanization policy on the Moroccan economy?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: Hassan II's Moroccanization policy had several immediate effects on the Moroccan economy. The policy led to the transfer of thousands of businesses and assets from foreign and French ownership to the Moroccan state and its loyalists, resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of industrial businesses that were Moroccan-owned. Additionally, the policy led to a significant increase in the wealth concentration among 36 Moroccan families, with the majority of the wealth being concentrated in their hands. This concentration of wealth resulted in a significant increase in the standard of living for the Moroccan middle and upper classes, as well as a decrease in poverty rates.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The patriotism engendered by Morocco's participation in the Middle East conflict and Western Sahara events contributed to Hassan's popularity. The king had dispatched Moroccan troops to the Sinai front after the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli War in October 1973.[176] Although they arrived too late to engage in hostilities, the action won Morocco goodwill among other Arab states.[citation needed] Soon after, the attention of the government turned to the acquisition of Western Sahara from Spain, an issue on which all major domestic parties agreed.[156]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: How did Hassan's popularity increase due to Morocco's participation in the Middle East conflict and Western Sahara events?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: Hassan's popularity increased due to Morocco's participation in the Middle East conflict and Western Sahara events because it showed the country's commitment to the Arab cause and its willingness to defend its sovereignty. The king's decision to dispatch Moroccan troops to the Sinai front after the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli War in October 1973 was seen as a courageous move by many Moroccans, and it earned the country significant goodwill among other Arab states. Additionally, the acquisition of Western Sahara from Spain was a popular move among all major domestic parties, and it further increased Hassan's popularity.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:29,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Following years of discontent and inequality during the 1980s, on 14 December 1990, a general strike was called by two major trade unions in the country to demand an increase in the minimum wage and other measures.

The death of one of the students further inflamed protests, resulting in buildings being burned and looted, particularly symbols of wealth. While the official death toll was 5 people, the New York Times reported a toll of 33 people and quoted an anonymous source claiming the real death toll was likely higher. The government denied reports that the deaths were due to the intervention of security forces and armoured vehicles. Many of those arrested were later released and the government promised to investigate and raise wages, though some of these measures were dismissed by skeptical opposition parties.[177]: 377 [178][179][180]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What were the key factors that led to the 1990 Fez protests and riots?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The 1990 Fez protests and riots were fueled by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. The primary cause was the death of a student during a protest, which sparked outrage and anger among the youth. The economic factors included high unemployment rates, poverty, and income inequality. The social factors included the marginalization of the Fez medina and the exclusion of the youth from political and economic activities. The political factors included the lack of representation and the absence of a democratic system.

Spain, meanwhile, had declared that even in the absence of a referendum, it intended to surrender political control of Western Sahara, and Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania convened a tripartite conference to resolve the territory's future.

The Polisario used Algerian bases for quick strikes against targets deep inside Morocco and Mauritania, as well as for operations in Western Sahara. In August 1979, after suffering military losses, Mauritania renounced its claim to Western Sahara and signed a peace treaty with the Polisario. In 1984, Morocco withdrew from the Organisation of African Unity due to the admission of the SADR as a member.[182] Morocco then annexed the entire territory and, in 1985 built a 2,500-kilometer sand berm around three-quarters of Western Sahara.[156]\n&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What was the main reason for the Polisario's decision to engage in armed conflict with Morocco?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer: The Polisario's decision to engage in armed conflict with Morocco was primarily due to their desire for independence from Morocco and their belief that the Polisario's cause was just, and that their struggle would eventually lead to the establishment of an independent Western Sahara.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;context&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In 1988, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on a United Nations (UN) peace plan, and a cease-fire and settlement plan went into effect in 1991.

The uprising was named after the city of Fes, Morocco, where Palestinian refugees had been living since the 1950s.

Question: What was the outcome of the Intifada of Fes?
Answer: The Intifada of Fes was quelled by French artillery fire, which led to the death of over 400 Palestinians and the injury of thousands more. The Israeli military also launched several large-scale operations in response to the uprising, resulting in the displacement of thousands of Palestinian families from their homes.

Answer: Yasser Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization during the Intifada of Fes. He was known for his efforts to negotiate a ceasefire with Israel, but his organization was also criticized for its involvement in acts of violence against civilians.</span></div></div>

As "pacification" proceeded, with the Zaian War and the War of the Rif, the French government focused on the exploitation of Morocco's mineral wealth, and particularly its phosphates; the creation of a modern transportation system with trains and buses; and the development of a modern agricultural sector geared to the French market.

Many Moroccan Goumiers, or indigenous soldiers in the French army, assisted the Allies in both World War I and World War II.[151] During World War II, the badly divided nationalist movement became more cohesive. However, the nationalists belief that an Allied victory would pave the way for independence was disappointed.[citation needed] In January 1944, the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, which subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement, released a manifesto demanding full independence, national reunification, and a democratic constitution.[152] The Sultan Muhammad V (1927–1961) had approved the manifesto before its submission to the French resident general, who answered that no basic change in the protectorate status was being considered.[citation needed] The general sympathy of the sultan for the nationalists became evident by the end of the war, although he still hoped to see complete independence achieved gradually. On 10 April 1947, in spite of a massacre instigated by French forces in Casablanca,[153] Sultan Muhammad V delivered a momentous speech in Tangier appealing for independence and territorial unity of Morocco, having travelled from French Morocco and through Spanish Morocco to reach the Tangier International Zone.[154][155] The résidence, supported by French economic interests and vigorously backed by most of the colons, adamantly refused to consider even reforms short of independence.[citation needed]</span></div></div>

In Fez, this broke into protests and rioting led by university students and youths. The death of one of the students further inflamed protests, resulting in buildings being burned and looted, particularly symbols of wealth. While the official death toll was 5 people, the New York Times reported a toll of 33 people and quoted an anonymous source claiming the real death toll was likely higher. The government denied reports that the deaths were due to the intervention of security forces and armoured vehicles. Many of those arrested were later released and the government promised to investigate and raise wages, though some of these measures were dismissed by skeptical opposition parties.[177]: 377 [178][179][180]

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Answer: The 1990 Fez protests and riots were fueled by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. The primary cause was the death of a student during a protest, which sparked outrage and anger among the youth. The economic factors included high unemployment rates, poverty, and income inequality. The social factors included the marginalization of the Fez medina and the exclusion of the youth from political and economic activities. The political factors included the lack of representation and the absence of a democratic system. The riots were also fueled by the government's failure to address these issues and its heavy-handed response to the protests.</span></div></div>

Morocco protested the proposed referendum and took its case to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, which ruled that despite historical "ties of allegiance" between Morocco and the tribes of Western Sahara, there was no legal justification for departing from the UN position on self-determination. Spain, meanwhile, had declared that even in the absence of a referendum, it intended to surrender political control of Western Sahara, and Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania convened a tripartite conference to resolve the territory's future.

The conquest of the Maghreb and Spain had, however, been undertaken principally as raids for slaves and plunder and the caliphate's leadership continued to treat all Berbers as pagans or slaves for tax purposes, even after their wholesale conversion to Islam.[28] In the area around Tangier, these hateful taxes were mostly paid in female slaves or in tender lambskins obtained by beating the ewes to induce premature birth.[28] Governor Yazid was murdered by Berber guards whom he had tattooed as slaves in c. 720,[28] and in the 730s similar treatment from Governor Ubayd Allah and al-Muradi, his deputy at Tangier, provoked the Berber Revolt. Inspired by the egalitarian Kharijite heresy, Barghawata and others under Maysara al-Matghari seized Tangier in the summer of 740.[29][30] In the Battle of the Nobles on the city's outskirts a few months later, Maysara's replacement Khalid ibn Hamid massacred the cream of Arab nobility in North Africa. An enraged Caliph Hisham ordered an attack from a second army "whose beginning is where they are and whose end is where I am," but this army was defeated at Bagdoura the next year.[31] The Barghawata were concentrated further south on the Atlantic coast, and area around Tangier fell into chaos until 785.[32]

English Tangier, fully occupied in January 1662,[38] was praised by Charles as "a jewell of immense value in the royal diadem"[17] despite the departing Portuguese taking away everything they could, even—according to the official report—"the very fflowers, the Windowes and the Dores".[39] Tangier received a garrison and a charter which made it equal to other English towns, but the religious orders were expropriated, the Portuguese residents nearly entirely left, and the town's Jews were driven out owing to fears concerning their loyalty.[40] Meanwhile, the Tangier Regiment were almost constantly under attack by locals who considered themselves mujahideen fighting a holy war.[32] Their principal leader was Khadir Ghaïlan (known to the English as "Gayland" or "Guyland") of the Banu Gurfat, whom the Earl of Peterborough attempted to buy off.[32] Ultimately, the truce lasted only for part of 1663 and 1664; on May 4 of the latter year, the Earl of Teviot and around 470 members of the garrison were killed in an ambush beside Jew's Hill.[32] Lord Belasyse happened to secure a longer-lasting treaty in 1666:[41] Khadir Ghaïlan hoped to support a pretender against the new Alawid sultan Al-Rashid and things subsequently went so badly for him that he was obliged to abide by its terms until his death in 1673.[32]

A town where men and women, with many different political and ideological tendencies, found refuge, including Spaniards from the right or from the left, Jews fleeing Nazi Germany and Moroccan dissidents. With very liberal economic and fiscal laws, Tangier became - in an international environment full of restrictions, prohibitions and monopolies - a tax haven with absolute freedom of trade.[63] The International Zone of Tangier had a 373 km2 (144 sq mi) area and, by the mid-1930s, a population of about 50,000 inhabitants: 30,000 Muslims; 12,000 Jews; and 8,000-odd Europeans, with a decreasing proportion of working-class Spaniards.[14]

The port has allowed Tangier to become a more globalised city with new international opportunities that will help facilitate economic growth.[77] The construction and operation of the port aimed to create 120,000 new jobs, 20,000 at the port and 100,000 resulting from growing economic activity.
