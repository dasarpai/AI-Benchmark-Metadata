Two participants take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. This design keeps the task tractable, while still facilitating linguistically rich and personal conversations. This helps to overcome the limitations of prior negotiation datasets… See the full description on the dataset page: https:\/\/huggingface.co\/datasets\/kchawla123\/casino.",

Two participants take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. This design keeps the task tractable, while still facilitating linguistically rich and personal conversations. This helps to overcome the limitations of prior negotiation datasets… See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kchawla123/casino.&quot;,&quot;downloads&quot;:150,&quot;downloadsAllTime&quot;:11512,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;kchawla123/casino&quot;,&quot;isLikedByUser&quot;:false,&quot;lastModified&quot;:&quot;2024-01-16T13:53:39.000Z&quot;,&quot;likes&quot;:5,&quot;paperswithcode_id&quot;:&quot;casino&quot;,&quot;datasetsServerInfo&quot;:{&quot;viewer&quot;:&quot;viewer&quot;,&quot;numRows&quot;:1030,&quot;libraries&quot;:[&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;pandas&quot;,&quot;mlcroissant&quot;,&quot;polars&quot;],&quot;formats&quot;:[&quot;parquet&quot;],&quot;modalities&quot;:[&quot;text&quot;]},&quot;discussionsDisabled&quot;:false,&quot;repoType&quot;:&quot;dataset&quot;,&quot;private&quot;:false,&quot;gated&quot;:false,&quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;task_categories:text-generation&quot;,&quot;task_categories:fill-mask&quot;,&quot;task_ids:dialogue-modeling&quot;,&quot;annotations_creators:expert-generated&quot;,&quot;language_creators:crowdsourced&quot;,&quot;multilinguality:monolingual&quot;,&quot;source_datasets:original&quot;,&quot;language:en&quot;,&quot;license:cc-by-4.0&quot;,&quot;size_categories:1K<n<10K&quot;,&quot;format:parquet&quot;,&quot;modality:text&quot;,&quot;library:datasets&quot;,&quot;library:pandas&quot;,&quot;library:mlcroissant&quot;,&quot;library:polars&quot;,&quot;region:us&quot;],&quot;tag_objs&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;task_categories:text-generation&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;text-generation&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;task_categories&quot;,&quot;subType&quot;:&quot;nlp&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;task_categories:fill-mask&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;fill-mask&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;task_categories&quot;,&quot;subType&quot;:&quot;nlp&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;task_ids:dialogue-modeling&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;dialogue-modeling&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;task_ids&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;annotations_creators:expert-generated&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;expert-generated&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;annotations_creators&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;language_creators:crowdsourced&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;crowdsourced&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;language_creators&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;multilinguality:monolingual&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;monolingual&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;multilinguality&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;source_datasets:original&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;original&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;source_datasets&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;language:en&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;English&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;language&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;license:cc-by-4.0&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;cc-by-4.0&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;license&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;size_categories:1K<n<10K&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;1K -

While I don't need much food for my hikes I do require a lot of water. I once went on a hiking trip when I was new to the activity and ran out of water. I got lost and almost dehydrated!

That seems too unbalanced to me. It's important for me to also let you know that wood is very crucial for me. When I was a newbie I didn't bring any wood because I figured I'm fine since I'm not scared of the dark. That night a bear snuck on me when I was sleeping. Thankfully I was able to scare it away with noise. However, ever since then I've brought a lot of wood with me so no bears can sneak up on me.

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>We provide a novel dataset (referred to as CaSiNo) of 1030 negotiation dialogues. Two participants take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. This design keeps the task tractable, while still facilitating linguistically rich and personal conversations. This helps to overcome the limitations of prior negotiation datasets such as Deal or No Deal and Craigslist Bargain. Each dialogue consists of rich meta-data including participant demographics, personality, and their subjective evaluation of the negotiation in terms of satisfaction and opponent likeness.</p>

		Annotation process

</h4>
<p>From the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.254.pdf">source paper</a> for this dataset: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three expert annotators independently annotated 396 dialogues containing 4615 utterances. The annotation guidelines were iterated over a subset of 5 dialogues, while the reliability scores were computed on a different subset of 10 dialogues. We use the nominal form of Krippendorff’s alpha (Krippendorff, 2018) to measure the inter-annotator agreement. We provide the annotation statistics in Table 2. Although we release all the annotations, we skip Coordination and Empathy for our analysis in this work, due to higher subjectivity resulting in relatively lower reliability scores.</p>
