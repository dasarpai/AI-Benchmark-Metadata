To Cook Pork Tenderloin&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To cook pork tenderloin, put it in a roasting pan and cook it in the oven for 55 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, turning it over halfway through. You can also sear the pork tenderloin on both sides in a skillet before putting it in the oven, which will reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes. If you want to grill pork tenderloin, start by preheating the grill to medium-high heat. Then, cook the tenderloin on the grill for 30-40 minutes over indirect heat, flipping it occasionally.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210605161310/https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236114/pork-roast-with-the-worlds-best-rub/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423074902/https://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/using-a-meat-thermometer/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20140115083937/http://www.bettycrocker.com:80/tips/tipslibrary/meat-poultry-fish/how-cook-pork-tenderloin&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507013819/https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/176359/easy-marinated-pork-tenderloin/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210422181536/https://www.thecookierookie.com/dry-rub-pork-seasoning-blend/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210128150001/https://animalsmart.org/feeding-the-world/products-from-animals/how-to-select-the-best-pork&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210121023525/https://www.inspiredtaste.net/10767/simply-seared-pork-tenderloin-recipe/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210422102849/https://natashaskitchen.com/roasted-pork-tenderloin-recipe/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190423055342/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm274114.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419222353/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/roast-pork-loin-with-garlic-and-rosemary-101684&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210515140103/https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/grilled-pork-tenderloin-recipe-1917672&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210720172535/http://www.thekitchn.com/why-brining-is-better-than-a-marinade-for-pork-tenderloin-242486&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210408223626/https://www.thekitchn.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pork-tenderloin-5-ways-to-cook-it-241820&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210605161310/https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236114/pork-roast-with-the-worlds-best-rub/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423074902/https://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/using-a-meat-thermometer/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20140115083937/http://www.bettycrocker.com:80/tips/tipslibrary/meat-poultry-fish/how-cook-pork-tenderloin\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507013819/https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/176359/easy-marinated-pork-tenderloin/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210422181536/https://www.thecookierookie.com/dry-rub-pork-seasoning-blend/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210128150001/https://animalsmart.org/feeding-the-world/products-from-animals/how-to-select-the-best-pork\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210121023525/https://www.inspiredtaste.net/10767/simply-seared-pork-tenderloin-recipe/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210422102849/https://natashaskitchen.com/roasted-pork-tenderloin-recipe/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190423055342/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm274114.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419222353/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/roast-pork-loin-with-garlic-and-rosemary-101684\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210515140103/https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/grilled-pork-tenderloin-recipe-1917672\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210720172535/http://www.thekitchn.com/why-brining-is-better-than-a-marinade-for-pork-tenderloin-242486\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210408223626/https://www.thekitchn.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pork-tenderloin-5-ways-to-cook-it-241820\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2635,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,635&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1423652,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,423,652&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Prevent Skin Peeling After Sunburn&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To prevent your skin from peeling after a sunburn, stir 1-3 cups of oatmeal into your bath and soak for 15-30 minutes, since oatmeal has soothing and moisturizing properties.

After you’ve pumped for 2 days, slowly increase your pumping frequency until you’re pumping for 10 minutes every 4 hours. Then, increase the frequency so you’re pumping every 2 to 3 hours for 15 to 20 minutes. You'll also need to pump at least once during the nighttime, so try setting an alarm to help you remember.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150926133058/http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/qa/fenugreek&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201027235836/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breast-feeding/art-20047138?pg=2&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506084800/https://www.asklenore.info/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/pumping_instructions.shtml&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200629012646/https://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/metoclopramide.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181101154719/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12192964&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200805172823/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breastfeeding-nutrition/art-20046912?pg=2&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200820014757/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/low-milk-supply/faq-20058148&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201028123620/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/induced-lactation/faq-20058403&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150918205629/http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2013/06/breastfeed-longer-the-whys-and-hows/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423162647/https://www.texaschildrens.org/departments/lactation-and-milk-bank-services/breastfeeding-your-hospitalized-baby&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150926133058/http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/qa/fenugreek\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201027235836/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breast-feeding/art-20047138?pg=2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506084800/https://www.asklenore.info/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/pumping_instructions.shtml\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200629012646/https://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/metoclopramide.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181101154719/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12192964\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200805172823/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breastfeeding-nutrition/art-20046912?pg=2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200820014757/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/low-milk-supply/faq-20058148\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201028123620/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/induced-lactation/faq-20058403\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150918205629/http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2013/06/breastfeed-longer-the-whys-and-hows/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423162647/https://www.texaschildrens.org/departments/lactation-and-milk-bank-services/breastfeeding-your-hospitalized-baby\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2959073,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,959,073&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Strip Cloth Diapers&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Before you strip cloth diapers, wash and dry them like you normally would so they're clean.

Finally, remove the diapers, and rinse them in cold water before hanging them up to air dry.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210609124752/https://www.paddedtushstats.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-stripping-cloth-diapers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210510084325/https://www.allaboutclothdiapers.com/when-and-how-to-strip-your-diapers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126225340/https://fluffloveuniversity.com/troubleshooting/solving-stinky-diaper-problems/how-to-strip-your-cloth-diapers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419005524/https://www.mamaslaundrytalk.com/how-to-strip-cloth-diapers-part-2/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210609124752/https://www.paddedtushstats.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-stripping-cloth-diapers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210510084325/https://www.allaboutclothdiapers.com/when-and-how-to-strip-your-diapers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126225340/https://fluffloveuniversity.com/troubleshooting/solving-stinky-diaper-problems/how-to-strip-your-cloth-diapers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419005524/https://www.mamaslaundrytalk.com/how-to-strip-cloth-diapers-part-2/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:909,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;909&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:398249,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;398,249&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Use Rosewater&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To use rosewater, try applying a mask of rosewater, honey, and coconut oil to your face and neck for 15-20 minutes once a week, which will keep your skin bright and hydrated.

Make sure the stall if free of any potential hazards, like raised nails, large splinters, and sharp edges. Next, clean and disinfect the stall by removing any old bedding and washing everything down with hot, soapy water. Once everything is dry, disinfect the stall with povidone iodine and pine oil. Then, make the stall comfortable by  purchasing bedding that’s appropriate for the mare and the newborn foal, like dust-free straw or shredded paper.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126125211/http://www.gaitedhorses.net/FoalingManagement.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170724020421/http://www.horsechannel.com:80/horse-keeping/mucking-101-81.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190802170616/http://normandymanorfarm.com/GetReadyBaby.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117092620/https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/horse-foaling/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126125211/http://www.gaitedhorses.net/FoalingManagement.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170724020421/http://www.horsechannel.com:80/horse-keeping/mucking-101-81.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190802170616/http://normandymanorfarm.com/GetReadyBaby.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117092620/https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/horse-foaling/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:322523,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;322,523&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Clean a Hermit Crab Tank&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Before you clean your hermit crab tank, remove the crabs and place them in a separate container with high walls.

If you want to add sardines to a meal, try them as a topping for homemade pizza.

If the tuner lights up red, turn the corresponding tuning peg and try playing the string again. Keep doing this until the tuner lights up green and then repeat with the rest of the strings on your guitar. If you don't have a tuner, find another instrument that's in tune, like a keyboard or a different guitar. Then, play the notes on that instrument that correspond with the strings on your guitar. Adjust your guitar strings with the tuning pegs until the notes match the other instrument.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200124174700/http://www.get-tuned.com:80/bass-tuning-piano.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200214114829/http://www.get-tuned.com:80/bass-5th-fret-tuning.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170406231236/http://www.dawsons.co.uk:80/blog/bass-guitar-tuning-guide&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170223002941/http://en.audiofanzine.com:80/bass/editorial/articles/how-to-tune-your-bass-guitar.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200124174700/http://www.get-tuned.com:80/bass-tuning-piano.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200214114829/http://www.get-tuned.com:80/bass-5th-fret-tuning.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170406231236/http://www.dawsons.co.uk:80/blog/bass-guitar-tuning-guide\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170223002941/http://en.audiofanzine.com:80/bass/editorial/articles/how-to-tune-your-bass-guitar.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2149,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,149&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1723646,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,723,646&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make Stickers&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To make your own stickers, you’ll need paper ,packing tape, and double-sided tape. First, draw or print your design on regular printer paper. Make sure the height of your design is less than the width of your packing tape, usually 3 inches (8 cm). Cover the front of your design with packing tape to give it a glossy, sticker-like feel. Then, use a pair of scissors to cut the sticker out. Leave a little excess paper around your design for later. Next, pull out the roll of double-sided tape with the uncovered sticky side facing up. Place your sticker on the double-sided tape with the design facing away from the sticky side. Press down to flatten the design against the tape. Finally, cut around your design to remove the excess tape and paper. When you want to use your sticker, just peel the cover off of the double-sided tape and press the sticker down against a flat surface.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200831020344/https://www.auntannie.com/CraftRecipes/SealGum/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150914172857/http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/do/homemadestickers.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170712053124/http://artfulparent.com:80/2012/07/make-your-own-contact-paper-stickers-with-kids.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210416175106/https://www.favecrafts.com/Unexpected-Ideas/Homemade-Stickers&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190126020321/https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/11/diy-stickers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190412022158/http://jaderbomb.com/2013/06/22/how-to-make-homemade-stickers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150501115604/http://www.skiptomylou.org:80/2009/08/26/how-to-make-homemade-stickers/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200123001630/http://www.auntannie.com:80/FridayFun/StickerFun/Index.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150911002112/http://craftingagreenworld.com/2011/09/19/how-to-make-re-usable-stickers-from-upcycled-paper/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200831020344/https://www.auntannie.com/CraftRecipes/SealGum/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150914172857/http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/do/homemadestickers.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170712053124/http://artfulparent.com:80/2012/07/make-your-own-contact-paper-stickers-with-kids.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210416175106/https://www.favecrafts.com/Unexpected-Ideas/Homemade-Stickers\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190126020321/https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/11/diy-stickers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190412022158/http://jaderbomb.com/2013/06/22/how-to-make-homemade-stickers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150501115604/http://www.skiptomylou.org:80/2009/08/26/how-to-make-homemade-stickers/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200123001630/http://www.auntannie.com:80/FridayFun/StickerFun/Index.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150911002112/http://craftingagreenworld.com/2011/09/19/how-to-make-re-usable-stickers-from-upcycled-paper/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:466,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;466&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:143118,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;143,118&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Concentrate on Your Homework&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To concentrate on your homework, start by settling into a quiet place and putting your phone away so it's not a distraction.

Also, take 5-minute breaks every 30 minutes so your homework doesn't feel endless and you have something to look forward to.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210927191206/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/the-autumn-of-the-multitaskers/306342/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420061941/https://www.writeraccess.com/blog/thinking-out-loud-is-not-crazy-its-creative/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160531115734/http://www.studentpulse.com:80/articles/762/the-impact-of-listening-to-music-on-cognitive-performance&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210927191206/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/the-autumn-of-the-multitaskers/306342/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420061941/https://www.writeraccess.com/blog/thinking-out-loud-is-not-crazy-its-creative/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160531115734/http://www.studentpulse.com:80/articles/762/the-impact-of-listening-to-music-on-cognitive-performance\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1006,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,006&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:734952,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;734,952&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Cook a Spiral Ham&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you want to warm up a ready-to-eat spiral cooked ham, put in on an aluminum baking sheet and wrap it in aluminum foil.

About 30 minutes before the ham is done, remove it from the oven and score it by using a knife to thinly slice the surface in a diamond pattern. If it didn’t come with glaze, make your own with half mustard and half brown sugar. Brush the glaze onto the meat and cook it for another 30 minutes.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200121081244/https://whatscookingamerica.net/Pork/Ham101.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190506123345/https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/hamcookingchart.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171214155529/http://www.seriouseats.com:80/2010/12/the-food-lab-how-to-pick-and-cook-a-holiday-h.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180727081207/http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/hamselect.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160522084646/http://www.ohsweetbasil.com:80/how-to-carve-a-spiral-ham.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200121082832/https://www.dakinfarm.com/Spiral-Sliced-Ham-Serving-Suggestions.dlp&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200128050151/https://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--665/carve-a-ham.asp&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181013192056/http://www.honeybaked.com:80/content/spiral-cut-ham.asp&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200121081244/https://whatscookingamerica.net/Pork/Ham101.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190506123345/https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/hamcookingchart.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171214155529/http://www.seriouseats.com:80/2010/12/the-food-lab-how-to-pick-and-cook-a-holiday-h.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180727081207/http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/hamselect.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160522084646/http://www.ohsweetbasil.com:80/how-to-carve-a-spiral-ham.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200121082832/https://www.dakinfarm.com/Spiral-Sliced-Ham-Serving-Suggestions.dlp\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200128050151/https://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--665/carve-a-ham.asp\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181013192056/http://www.honeybaked.com:80/content/spiral-cut-ham.asp\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2596,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,596&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3005106,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3,005,106&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make Onion Gravy&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To make onion gravy, first melt butter in a large saucepan.

Next, add live plants, such as moss and fern, to provide food for your shrimp, as well as an LED tank light to help your plants thrive. Finally, let your tank run for at least 2 weeks to establish a bacteria base in the water and filters before adding your shrimp.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170224185912/http://www.theshrimpfarm.com/articles/fresh-water-invertebrates.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190729192732/http://planetinverts.com:80/for_the_newcomer.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201126234119/http://worldwideaquaculture.com/freshwater-shrimp-farming-how-to-start-your-own-shrimp-farm/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200426082829/https://www.aquariuminfo.org/shrimptank.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200426023156/https://www.aquariuminfo.org/volumecalculator.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170224185912/http://www.theshrimpfarm.com/articles/fresh-water-invertebrates.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190729192732/http://planetinverts.com:80/for_the_newcomer.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201126234119/http://worldwideaquaculture.com/freshwater-shrimp-farming-how-to-start-your-own-shrimp-farm/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200426082829/https://www.aquariuminfo.org/shrimptank.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200426023156/https://www.aquariuminfo.org/volumecalculator.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1680,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,680&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:6618,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;6,618&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Give a Cat Medicine&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To give a cat medicine with food, start by getting some special treats, like wet cat food or Pill Pockets.

Alternatively, to give your cat medicine without food, wrap your cat in a towel with its head exposed, open its mouth, and put the pill or liquid toward the back of the tongue. Then, close your cat’s mouth, stroke its neck, and give it a dropper full of water.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201030051107/http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/administering-injectable-medication-to-your-cat&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161026085310/http://www.vcahospitals.com:80/main/cat-care/article/how-to-give-your-cat-a-pill&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150912053059/http://pets.webmd.com:80/cats/guide/give-medications-cat&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151019060237/http://www.aspca.org:80/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/giving-your-cat-pill&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201030051107/http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/administering-injectable-medication-to-your-cat\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161026085310/http://www.vcahospitals.com:80/main/cat-care/article/how-to-give-your-cat-a-pill\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150912053059/http://pets.webmd.com:80/cats/guide/give-medications-cat\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151019060237/http://www.aspca.org:80/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/giving-your-cat-pill\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2298,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,298&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2793487,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,793,487&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Kill Bed Bugs&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The best way to kill bed bugs is to run your clothes and bedding through the dryer on high heat for 10-20 minutes.

To clean your nose piercing, start by washing your hands with antibacterial soap so you don't spread germs with them. Then, microwave some saline solution for 10 seconds and wipe down your piercing with it. Don't worry if you notice some redness, swelling, or minor pain for the first few days. However, if you notice green or yellow discharge, or if you see a red, raised bump at your piercing site, you may have an infection and should seek medical attention.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170604060301/http://www.modifybodypiercing.com:80/body-aftercare.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220101065646/http://youngwomenshealth.org/2013/08/07/body-piercing/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423011522/https://www.piercingbible.com/saline-soaks/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220108174851/https://www.newhealthguide.org/Nose-Piercing-Bump.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507013820/http://skin-artists.com/nose-piercing-healing.htm&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170604060301/http://www.modifybodypiercing.com:80/body-aftercare.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220101065646/http://youngwomenshealth.org/2013/08/07/body-piercing/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423011522/https://www.piercingbible.com/saline-soaks/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220108174851/https://www.newhealthguide.org/Nose-Piercing-Bump.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507013820/http://skin-artists.com/nose-piercing-healing.htm\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2121,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,121&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:8169917,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;8,169,917&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Teach Your Dog the Stop Barking Command&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To teach your dog the \&quot;stop barking\&quot; command, start by teaching it how to “speak”  so you can control when it's allowed to bark. Start by putting some treats in your pocket, telling your dog to “speak” while triggering the action with a knock or doorbell, and rewarding it when it barks. Once your dog is barking on command, place a treat in front of its nose while it's barking to get it to stop and sniff. Then, say “quiet” as soon as it stops barking, and give it the reward. When you feel confident that your dog understands \&quot;quiet,\&quot; have someone ring the doorbell, give the command, and reward your dog when it stops barking.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181021204327/http://www.humanesociety.org:80/animals/dogs/tips/how_to_stop_barking.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210503145029/https://dogtime.com/dog-health/general/675-barking-aspca&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210225074136/https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-teach-your-dog-the-stop-barking-command&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181021204327/http://www.humanesociety.org:80/animals/dogs/tips/how_to_stop_barking.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210503145029/https://dogtime.com/dog-health/general/675-barking-aspca\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210225074136/https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-teach-your-dog-the-stop-barking-command\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2357,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,357&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1165322,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,165,322&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Remove Scars on Legs&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To remove scars on your legs, exfoliate your legs regularly in the shower with a brush or scrub, which will help your scars fade faster.

Once you have your concept, gather images from magazines, newspapers, or print them off the internet and organize them by color, shape, material, texture, or mood.

Afterwards, hammer in 2 upholstery nails into each corner of the rug, and use a third nail to secure the midpoint between each corner.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150110070343/http://prudentbaby.com:80/2012/10/baby-kid/how-to-hang-a-rug/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151230023256/http://www.thisoldhouse.com:80/toh/how-to/step/0,,20416130_20834908,00.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210301041552/http://marlamallett.com/mounting.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210416075631/https://www.heddels.com/dictionary/warp/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210124035556/http://www.rugrag.com/post/How-Can-I-Display-my-Rug-as-a-Wall-Hanging.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180109053652/http://www.wisegeek.org:80/what-are-warp-and-weft.htm&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150110070343/http://prudentbaby.com:80/2012/10/baby-kid/how-to-hang-a-rug/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151230023256/http://www.thisoldhouse.com:80/toh/how-to/step/0,,20416130_20834908,00.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210301041552/http://marlamallett.com/mounting.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210416075631/https://www.heddels.com/dictionary/warp/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210124035556/http://www.rugrag.com/post/How-Can-I-Display-my-Rug-as-a-Wall-Hanging.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180109053652/http://www.wisegeek.org:80/what-are-warp-and-weft.htm\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:914,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;914&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1069191,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,069,191&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Stop Breast Feeding&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To stop breast feeding, start by feeding your baby with your chosen substitute, such as breast milk in a bottle, during a daytime feeding. You could also try doing this feeding in another room to help your baby adjust to the new way of eating. After a few days, replace another feeding with a cup or bottle. Then, begin offering your baby a bottle before every feeding, even the ones you're not planning to replace, as this will get your baby used to eating in the new way.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171001173059/http://www.webmd.com:80/parenting/baby/tc/weaning-what-is-expected&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160503110505/http://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/tc/weaning-when-to-call-a-doctor&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20130920201638/http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/breastfeeding/faqs/weaning&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171001173059/http://www.webmd.com:80/parenting/baby/tc/weaning-what-is-expected\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160503110505/http://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/tc/weaning-when-to-call-a-doctor\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20130920201638/http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/breastfeeding/faqs/weaning\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1093,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,093&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:35298,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;35,298&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Crack Your Back&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To crack your back, try doing a supine twist. First, lie down on the floor with one leg bent and one leg extended. Then, bring your bent knee over your extended leg and toward the floor. Keep your shoulders flat on the ground. Finally, switch legs and repeat. You can also try to track your back using the back of a short chair. First, sit in a chair with a backrest that comes up to the middle of your back. Then, place both of your hands on the back of your head, and slowly lean back in the chair until your back cracks. Move forward in your seat to crack higher up on your back, or move backward to crack lower on your back. However you crack your back, remember to be gentle and move slowly so you don’t hurt yourself. If you’re experiencing back pain, talk to your doctor before attempting to crack your back on your own.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170929134128/http://www.orthop.washington.edu/?q=patient-care/articles/arthritis/frequently-asked-questions-about-arthritis.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211011095730/https://www.spine-health.com/treatment/chiropractic/chiropractic-adjustment&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201127084331/https://lumbarspineassessment.wordpress.com/examination/active-range-of-motion/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220107062131/https://www.yogabasics.com/asana/child/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180710040159/https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/259603.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210115181728/https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093465&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170929134128/http://www.orthop.washington.edu/?q=patient-care/articles/arthritis/frequently-asked-questions-about-arthritis.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211011095730/https://www.spine-health.com/treatment/chiropractic/chiropractic-adjustment\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201127084331/https://lumbarspineassessment.wordpress.com/examination/active-range-of-motion/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20220107062131/https://www.yogabasics.com/asana/child/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180710040159/https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/259603.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210115181728/https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093465\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1411,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,411&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:288559,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;288,559&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Win at Scrabble&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To win at Scrabble, play as many words as you can on premium squares, like double letter or triple word scores, to boost your point count. Additionally, try adding an “S” to a high-scoring word already on the board to maximize your score. You can also look for opportunities to make compound words, like adding “air” to “ball,” to get the combined point total of both words. If you end up with hard to use tiles, such as “Q,” “J,” or “Z,” try forming high-scoring words, like “qat,” “jeu,” and “zee,” to maximize your chance of winning.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506220233/http://www.scrabble.org.au/strategy/strategy.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200510232817/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/games/10403402/Top-Scrabble-tips-revealed-so-you-never-have-to-lose-again.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506220233/http://www.scrabble.org.au/strategy/strategy.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200510232817/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/games/10403402/Top-Scrabble-tips-revealed-so-you-never-have-to-lose-again.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:693,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;693&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:543373,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;543,373&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Get an ISBN Number&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To get an ISBN number, start by visiting the website for the International ISBN agency and clicking on the orange button labeled “Find an agency.” Next, select the national agency in which your company’s headquarters is located or your nation if you’re applying for yourself.

Make sure to stay out of the sun while your burn is healing and take over-the-counter pain reliever if it is very painful.

In order to survive if you have been buried, dig a pocket around your face to breath into. Additionally, try to stick one arm straight up toward the snow’s surface to orient yourself and to hopefully be seen by rescuers.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20131013170940/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=survive-an-avalanche-skier-air-bag&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181005133639/http://articles.latimes.com:80/2012/feb/21/nation/la-na-nn-avalanche-20120220&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210411021318/http://fsavalanche.com/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20131013170940/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=survive-an-avalanche-skier-air-bag\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181005133639/http://articles.latimes.com:80/2012/feb/21/nation/la-na-nn-avalanche-20120220\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210411021318/http://fsavalanche.com/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:686,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;686&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1496,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,496&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Build a Darkroom&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To build a darkroom, find a room in your house with no windows or small windows that can be easily covered. Then, tape black fabric around any windows to cut out the light. Next, split your room into a dry side and a wet side, with the dry side being for your electrical equipment and the wet side for developing photos. When your room is ready, bring in a table and your equipment, including your enlarger, chemicals, and printing kit. Finally, set up your funnel, trays, and film clips on the wet side and reels, easel, and safe light on the dry side.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210120143648/https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/buying-guide/traditional-darkroom-buying-guide&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210305081108/https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-guide-to-setting-up-your-own-photographic-darkroom--photo-718&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210504204751/https://www.apogeephoto.com/the-10-steps-to-setting-up-a-home-darkroom-on-a-budget/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210124122026/https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-low-budget-darkroom--photo-14293&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210120143648/https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/buying-guide/traditional-darkroom-buying-guide\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210305081108/https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-guide-to-setting-up-your-own-photographic-darkroom--photo-718\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210504204751/https://www.apogeephoto.com/the-10-steps-to-setting-up-a-home-darkroom-on-a-budget/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210124122026/https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-low-budget-darkroom--photo-14293\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:227,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;227&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:9336065,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;9,336,065&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Grill Bratwurst&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To grill bratwurst, make sure to maintain a low heat and turn the brats often to keep them from burning. Heat up your grill so the temperature is between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Brush the grill with a little vegetable oil to keep the brats from sticking. Once the grill is hot, lay the sausages vertically along the grate. Grill your brats for 15 to 20 minutes, turning them every 3 to 5 minutes to make sure they cook evenly. A perfectly cooked brat will turn dull reddish-brown when it’s done, but to make sure, you’ll want to use a meat thermometer. The temperature should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201031201635/https://www.foxvalleyfoodie.com/grill-brats-perfection/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170709003431/https://www.charbroil.com/community/how-to-grill-brats-temperature/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201029105657/https://www.myrecipes.com/how-to/cooking-questions/how-to-oil-grill&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201202065821/https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-clean-your-grill-barbecue-oiling-thegrate-charcoal.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200920022835/https://www.afamilyfeast.com/bratwurst-and-sauerkraut/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201030073200/http://www.bratsandbeer.com/best-bratwurst-sides/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170706204133/http://www.tasteofhome.com:80/cooking-tips/ask-the-test-kitchen/great-grilled-brats&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200205140631/http://kitchenproject.com:80/german/Bratwurst/BBQbrat.htm&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201031201635/https://www.foxvalleyfoodie.com/grill-brats-perfection/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170709003431/https://www.charbroil.com/community/how-to-grill-brats-temperature/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201029105657/https://www.myrecipes.com/how-to/cooking-questions/how-to-oil-grill\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201202065821/https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-clean-your-grill-barbecue-oiling-thegrate-charcoal.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200920022835/https://www.afamilyfeast.com/bratwurst-and-sauerkraut/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201030073200/http://www.bratsandbeer.com/best-bratwurst-sides/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170706204133/http://www.tasteofhome.com:80/cooking-tips/ask-the-test-kitchen/great-grilled-brats\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200205140631/http://kitchenproject.com:80/german/Bratwurst/BBQbrat.htm\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2200,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,200&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:41,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:209575,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;209,575&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Get Sweat Stains out of Bras&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To get sweat stains out of your bra, try using baking soda. First, mix it with water to make a paste. Then, rub it onto the stained areas of your bra. Leave it in the sun for a few hours to help the baking soda work. After the baking soda paste has dried, gently peel it off your bra. Machine wash your bra like normal to remove any leftover paste and to help it smell fresh. Alternatively, use regular dish detergent to get the stains out. However, this only works on white bras, as the detergent can discolor dyed bras. First, pour a small amount of detergent onto the stains and rub it in with your fingers or an old toothbrush. Once you’ve rubbed detergent in, wash your bra in cold water to remove the soap.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200812153253/https://clark.com/family-lifestyle/remove-yellow-armpit-sweat-stains/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210531012727/http://www.housecleaningcentral.com/en/cleaning-tips/stain-removal/sweat-perspiration-deodorant.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180408053646/https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-regular-bleach-color-safe-bleach-6cf5a183366cb806&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210822024713/https://www.stain-removal-101.com/hydrogen-peroxide-for-laundry.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210726181746/https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/how-to/a44293/how-to-wash-bras/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210527175453/http://www.topcleaningsecrets.com/house/how-to-clean-stains-from-clothes.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200812153253/https://clark.com/family-lifestyle/remove-yellow-armpit-sweat-stains/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210531012727/http://www.housecleaningcentral.com/en/cleaning-tips/stain-removal/sweat-perspiration-deodorant.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180408053646/https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-regular-bleach-color-safe-bleach-6cf5a183366cb806\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210822024713/https://www.stain-removal-101.com/hydrogen-peroxide-for-laundry.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210726181746/https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/how-to/a44293/how-to-wash-bras/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210527175453/http://www.topcleaningsecrets.com/house/how-to-clean-stains-from-clothes.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1978,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,978&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:42,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1428072,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,428,072&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Address a Letter to England&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To address a letter to England, write the recipient's name and address on the bottom left of the envelope.

For more formal occasions, affix your brooch to the lapel of a jacket or blazer to add a little personality.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210414072016/https://fashionsy.com/17-ways-of-how-to-wear-a-brooch/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190102160339/http://therichlifeinwinecountry.com/2015/12/how-i-wear-my-brooch.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210305115307/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/brooch-unexpected-accessory-need-now/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181219075818/http://fashionisers.com:80/accessories/how-to-wear-2016-trend-of-brooches/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210301073641/https://lemonstripes.com/fashion/outfits/how-to-wear-brooch/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418051059/http://archive.jsonline.com/features/fashion/there-are-modern-ways-to-wear-a-brooch-b99714142z1-377835551.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211104052429/https://people.com/royals/princess-diana-jewelry-collection-tiaras/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210414072016/https://fashionsy.com/17-ways-of-how-to-wear-a-brooch/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190102160339/http://therichlifeinwinecountry.com/2015/12/how-i-wear-my-brooch.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210305115307/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/brooch-unexpected-accessory-need-now/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181219075818/http://fashionisers.com:80/accessories/how-to-wear-2016-trend-of-brooches/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210301073641/https://lemonstripes.com/fashion/outfits/how-to-wear-brooch/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418051059/http://archive.jsonline.com/features/fashion/there-are-modern-ways-to-wear-a-brooch-b99714142z1-377835551.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211104052429/https://people.com/royals/princess-diana-jewelry-collection-tiaras/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1534839,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,534,839&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Buy an Engagement Ring&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To buy an engagement ring, find out your significant other's ring size and what kind of ring styles they like.

You should also make sure your dog has a behavioral issue that pheromones can effectively treat, like anxiety or aggression. Before applying pheromones to your dog or its environment, speak to your vet to make sure they don’t have any medical concerns. If you want to give your dog pheromones for short periods of time, opt for a spray, which usually needs to be sprayed around the room every 4 hours. For a longer term option, purchase a diffuser or collar containing pheromones, which can last up to a month.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190905113441/http://veterinarymedicine.dvm360.com:80/just-ask-expert-how-can-i-stop-dog-urine-marking-house&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201111184012/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2839826/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419221307/https://news.petmeds.com/news/pet-supplies/how-do-dog-pheromone-products-work/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210609185006/https://www.akcchf.org/canine-health/your-dogs-health/noise-phobia-in-dogs.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210508141634/https://okawvetclinic.com/pheromones.pml&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211103074711/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues/separation-anxiety&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181009114533/http://www.humanesociety.org:80/animals/dogs/tips/separation_anxiety.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211019014457/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/behavioral-help-your-pet&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190905113441/http://veterinarymedicine.dvm360.com:80/just-ask-expert-how-can-i-stop-dog-urine-marking-house\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201111184012/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2839826/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419221307/https://news.petmeds.com/news/pet-supplies/how-do-dog-pheromone-products-work/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210609185006/https://www.akcchf.org/canine-health/your-dogs-health/noise-phobia-in-dogs.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210508141634/https://okawvetclinic.com/pheromones.pml\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211103074711/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues/separation-anxiety\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181009114533/http://www.humanesociety.org:80/animals/dogs/tips/separation_anxiety.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211019014457/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/behavioral-help-your-pet\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:3603,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;3,603&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Eat a Banana&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To eat a banana, first find one that’s ripe so it’s sweet and easy to \ndigest. If it’s still green, it’s not ripe enough yet. When it turns \nyellow, the banana is ripe enough to eat. It will be sweetest when there \nare a few light brown spots on the peel. To peel the banana, snap back the \nstalk at the top of the fruit, then pull it downwards. Pull the rest of the \nskin off in similar strips. You can also peel the banana from the blossom \nend which is the flat, brown stub at the end of the banana. Pinch just \nbehind the blossom end to break it apart, then peel the skin off the \nbanana. Eat the fruit whole or cut it into pieces. For a healthy breakfast, \nadd banana pieces to a smoothie, cereal, yogurt, or oatmeal. For something \nsweeter, dip whole or sliced bananas in melted chocolate. &quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418203943/https://onelittleproject.com/pan-fried-cinnamon-bananas/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170816074805/http://livingwellmom.com:80/2016/02/chunky-monkey-bites/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419091010/https://www.saveur.com/article/Techniques/5-Banana-Varieties/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210417191438/https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/copycat-trader-joes-gone-bananas/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190315160607/https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/recipes/snacks/low-calorie/after-workout-snacks/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423134602/https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-pictures/foods-that-help-fight-pms.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170610082524/http://lmld.org/2016/01/01/peanut-butter-banana-smoothie/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418203943/https://onelittleproject.com/pan-fried-cinnamon-bananas/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170816074805/http://livingwellmom.com:80/2016/02/chunky-monkey-bites/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419091010/https://www.saveur.com/article/Techniques/5-Banana-Varieties/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210417191438/https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/copycat-trader-joes-gone-bananas/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190315160607/https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/recipes/snacks/low-calorie/after-workout-snacks/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210423134602/https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-pictures/foods-that-help-fight-pms.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170610082524/http://lmld.org/2016/01/01/peanut-butter-banana-smoothie/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2629,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,629&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:48,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:548246,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;548,246&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Sing Into a Microphone&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To sing into a microphone, hold it at a 45 degree angle with the head of the microphone about 1-4 inches away from your mouth.

If you have a moderate case of pneumonia, you may be admitted to a hospital where you'll receive antibiotics through an IV until you're feeling better.

To peel with a knife, insert the pointed tip into the skin at the top of the orange and slice off the peel by rotating the orange around the knife. To peel with a spoon, make a 1 inch cut on the side of the orange, slicing through the skin but not the fruit.

If you can, take your metal surface outside. Otherwise, put a drop cloth underneath it. Then, scrub the metal with coarse sandpaper to remove any rust or old paint. If you item is rusty, apply a rust converter and scrub the metal with a wire brush if the rust won't come off with just the sandpaper. Wipe the metal with a damp cloth to get any dust or debris off of the surface, then let it air dry. Next, fill a paint tray with metal primer, and use a brush or roller to apply an even coat to the metal surface. Wait at least 24 hours for the primer to dry. Now, fill a clean paint tray with an oil-based paint designed for metal. Apply the paint using a brush or roller, starting with the exterior edges to paint the trim before working your way to the easier, flatter sections. Finally, wait at least 12 hours to let the paint dry before handling the metal. For textured metals, use a spray primer instead of liquid primer. Hold the can 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) away from your sanded metal and coat the entire surface.

Water your mint frequently so the soil stays damp and pinch off the plant's flower buds as they appear to extend your harvesting season!&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210323201356/https://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/herbs/grow-mint-plants/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200217233845/http://www.gardeningblog.net:80/how-to-grow/mint/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125155448/https://www.naturallivingideas.com/how-to-make-your-own-super-powered-potting-soil/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181006053022/http://bonnieplants.com:80/growing/growing-mint/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210813095426/https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-dos-donts-of-growing-mint-147458&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210323201356/https://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/herbs/grow-mint-plants/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200217233845/http://www.gardeningblog.net:80/how-to-grow/mint/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125155448/https://www.naturallivingideas.com/how-to-make-your-own-super-powered-potting-soil/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181006053022/http://bonnieplants.com:80/growing/growing-mint/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210813095426/https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-dos-donts-of-growing-mint-147458\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2036,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,036&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5774663,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5,774,663&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make Detox Water&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To make detox water, you’ll need fruits, vegetables, and herbs of your choice. For example, you can make lemon, cucumber, and mint water, or you can try mixing strawberry, lemon, and plain water. Once you have your ingredients, rinse and dry them to get rid of any bacteria. Then, cut any ingredients that need cutting, like lemon and cucumber, into small chunks or slices to release their flavors. Once you’ve cut your ingredients, fill a jug with water and add your fruits, vegetables, and herbs. To finish your detox water, give it a stir and store it in the refrigerator for 12 hours before you serve it to infuse all of the flavors.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list

things to do or talk about. If you’re staying to eat, offer to help laying the table or washing dishes after dinner. Although you might be intimate with the girl, don’t assume that she wants to do anything physical, just because she invited you over. If in doubt, let her lead the way. If her family are around while you’re there, avoid physical contact with her to avoid any awkwardness. You might be nervous about what they’ll think of you, but try to relax and be yourself so they can see the person you really are. You can also ask the girl about her family ahead of time so you know what to expect.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190627195133/https://www.primermagazine.com/2013/live/what-to-do-when-meeting-her-parents&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180112114743/https://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/07/15/meet-the-parents/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201026183633/https://www.askmen.com/dating/heidi_60/66_dating_girl.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200919034516/https://www.askmen.com/dating/heidi_60/66c_dating_girl.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160521175426/http://www.complex.com:80/pop-culture/2012/12/a-gentlemans-guide-to-meeting-your-girlfriends-parents/cut-the-act&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180303020957/http://www.complex.com:80/pop-culture/2012/12/a-gentlemans-guide-to-meeting-your-girlfriends-parents/embrace-the-scene-accordingly&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190627195133/https://www.primermagazine.com/2013/live/what-to-do-when-meeting-her-parents\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180112114743/https://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/07/15/meet-the-parents/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201026183633/https://www.askmen.com/dating/heidi_60/66_dating_girl.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200919034516/https://www.askmen.com/dating/heidi_60/66c_dating_girl.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160521175426/http://www.complex.com:80/pop-culture/2012/12/a-gentlemans-guide-to-meeting-your-girlfriends-parents/cut-the-act\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180303020957/http://www.complex.com:80/pop-culture/2012/12/a-gentlemans-guide-to-meeting-your-girlfriends-parents/embrace-the-scene-accordingly\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2132,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,132&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7852067,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7,852,067&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Find Out if Someone Has Been Arrested&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you want to know if someone has been arrested, try contacting the local police station.

If they don’t know, try contacting local jails, since it’s likely an officer would have brought the person there following an arrest. Alternatively, try searching through online arrest records. Visit your local city or county’s police department website. Next, locate the arrest records section and enter the personal information of the person you’re looking for. If you find the person’s information, contact the location where it says they’re being held to find out more about the arrest.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160926022226/http://www.nolo.com:80/legal-encyclopedia/getting-information-helping-booked-arrestees.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200807032652/http://ws.ocsd.org/Whoisinjail/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200805201640/https://www.shelbycountytn.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=70&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200513201649/https://tcsheriff.org/about/faqs&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200508204643/https://clevelandmunicipalcourt.org/how-do-i-&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200809025134/https://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-to-locate-someone-who-has-been-arrested/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160926022226/http://www.nolo.com:80/legal-encyclopedia/getting-information-helping-booked-arrestees.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200807032652/http://ws.ocsd.org/Whoisinjail/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200805201640/https://www.shelbycountytn.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=70\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200513201649/https://tcsheriff.org/about/faqs\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200508204643/https://clevelandmunicipalcourt.org/how-do-i-\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200809025134/https://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-to-locate-someone-who-has-been-arrested/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:278,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;278&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:59,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1160295,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,160,295&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Light a Pilot Light&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To light a pilot light, first turn the gas control valve to off and wait 5 to 10 minutes until all the gas fumes are gone.

Then, press the reset switch button or lever and light the tube. After the tube lights, keep holding the switch for 1 minute. Repeat this process 1 to 2 more times if the pilot doesn’t stay lit.

However, if you look and act your best, you'll stand a better chance of winning her over. One way to seem cute is to be a little shy! The next time you’re around your crush, make eye contact then look away quickly. Or, hide behind your hair when you talk to them. Not only will this make you seem cute, but it will give you an air of mystery that makes things more exciting. Additionally, don’t forget to smile, since a charming smile goes a long way. Besides acting cute, you can try out a new, cute haircut! If you have a favorite celebrity or athlete, consider getting a hair cut similar to theirs. Just bring a photo in when you go to the hairdresser for reference.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418152504/https://www.primermagazine.com/2011/learn/15-hygiene-habits-that-you-shouldnt-miss-in-your-daily-routine&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211111205841/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/skin-care/art-20048237&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420133540/https://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/teen-hygiene&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170709115710/https://www.muscleforlife.com/how-to-build-self-confidence/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181212053552/https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/features/lifestyle&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211110012020/https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170122142545/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/basics/definition/CON-20021422&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418152504/https://www.primermagazine.com/2011/learn/15-hygiene-habits-that-you-shouldnt-miss-in-your-daily-routine\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211111205841/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/skin-care/art-20048237\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420133540/https://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/teen-hygiene\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170709115710/https://www.muscleforlife.com/how-to-build-self-confidence/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20181212053552/https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/features/lifestyle\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211110012020/https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170122142545/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/basics/definition/CON-20021422\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1846,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,846&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:61,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:349650,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;349,650&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Prevent Fainting&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;When you feel yourself starting to get faint, boost your blood salt and sugar levels by snacking on some pretzels or crackers and drinking a little juice.

Also, try adding lemon to your drinks, because in addition to antiviral and antibacterial properties, lemons contain a lot of vitamin C. For a sore or irritated throat, gargle warm salt water. By gargling a mixture of 6 ounces of warm water and 1 teaspoon of salt, you can reduce the swelling in your throat and lessen your cough.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170915133005/http://www.emedicinehealth.com:80/relieving_a_cough-health/article_em.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200702161042/https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/in-depth/cold-remedies/art-20046403&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201026184955/https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/cough/basics/causes/sym-20050846&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200304003620/http://www.ayurvedacollege.com/articles/students/turmeric&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200524140856/https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/cough/basics/when-to-see-doctor/sym-20050846&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200412003457/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18056558&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151228174519/http://kidshealth.org:80/parent/general/eyes/childs_cough.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151026134542/http://www.kitchenfrau.com:80/homemade-cough-and-cold-syrup/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200926084110/https://www.livescience.com/44249-fish-oil-supplements-benefits.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160619063239/https://healthandcounseling.unca.edu/congestion-sore-throat-cough&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160929070706/http://www.webmd.com:80/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cold-remedies?page=2&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200507235232/https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/the-science-of-chicken-soup/?_r=0&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170915133005/http://www.emedicinehealth.com:80/relieving_a_cough-health/article_em.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200702161042/https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/in-depth/cold-remedies/art-20046403\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201026184955/https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/cough/basics/causes/sym-20050846\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200304003620/http://www.ayurvedacollege.com/articles/students/turmeric\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200524140856/https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/cough/basics/when-to-see-doctor/sym-20050846\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200412003457/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18056558\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151228174519/http://kidshealth.org:80/parent/general/eyes/childs_cough.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151026134542/http://www.kitchenfrau.com:80/homemade-cough-and-cold-syrup/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200926084110/https://www.livescience.com/44249-fish-oil-supplements-benefits.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160619063239/https://healthandcounseling.unca.edu/congestion-sore-throat-cough\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160929070706/http://www.webmd.com:80/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cold-remedies?page=2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200507235232/https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/the-science-of-chicken-soup/?_r=0\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2022,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,022&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:63,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:64817,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;64,817&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Eat Pistachios&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To eat pistachios, look for the nuts that already have a crack in their shells, since you can easily pry their shells off with your fingers.

Then, bake the skin at 250 degrees F. After 3 hours, remove the pork from the oven and heat some lard or peanut oil in a pan until it bubbles. Finally, fry the skins in batches for about 1 minute or until they're puffy.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170717222825/http://healthyrecipesblogs.com:80/2015/08/05/homemade-pork-rinds/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161126093035/http://www.cookingchanneltv.com:80/recipes/pork-rinds-chicharron.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171218192950/https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2015/04/29/how-to-make-pork-cracklings-aka-pork-rinds-aka-chicharrones&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190509022931/https://baconsheir.com/pages/how-to-make-pork-rinds&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170804115812/http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com:80/2014/01/homemade-chicharrones-pork-rinds-low-carb-and-gluten-free.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170717222825/http://healthyrecipesblogs.com:80/2015/08/05/homemade-pork-rinds/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161126093035/http://www.cookingchanneltv.com:80/recipes/pork-rinds-chicharron.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171218192950/https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2015/04/29/how-to-make-pork-cracklings-aka-pork-rinds-aka-chicharrones\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190509022931/https://baconsheir.com/pages/how-to-make-pork-rinds\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170804115812/http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com:80/2014/01/homemade-chicharrones-pork-rinds-low-carb-and-gluten-free.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2612,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,612&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:67,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4408351,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4,408,351&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Work Out Water Tank Capacity&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To work out water tank capacity for a horizontal cylinder tank, measure the radius of the bottom of the cylinder and find the area of the circle.

When you’re choosing a pot or container, pick one that is at least 4 inches taller than the container your gardenia came in so it has more room to grow. Fill the pot with a soil that drains well such as one that includes peat moss or sand to help with drainage. Place your gardenias in a location that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight each day, but is out of direct sunlight, such as a windowsill or near a shady tree in your yard. Water your gardenias about once or twice a week, when the soil is dry below the surface.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211105035914/https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=367&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210118210932/https://www.monrovia.com/how-to-grow-gardenias&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211214011126/https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211229042831/https://www.gardenia.net/guide/learn-how-to-grow-and-care-for-your-gardenia&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126193124/https://balconygardenweb.com/growing-gardenias-in-pots-gardenia-tree-care-and-how-to-grow/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211105035914/https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=367\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210118210932/https://www.monrovia.com/how-to-grow-gardenias\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211214011126/https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211229042831/https://www.gardenia.net/guide/learn-how-to-grow-and-care-for-your-gardenia\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126193124/https://balconygardenweb.com/growing-gardenias-in-pots-gardenia-tree-care-and-how-to-grow/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:596842,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;596,842&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Outline a Novel&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There are several different methods you can use to outline your novel. If you’d like to create a narrative outline, start by determining your novel’s opening scene. Next, come up with an inciting incident, or something that happens to set your main character on a specific path. From there, determine the main conflict, which is an intense issue that the character has to address or deal with. Whatever the character does after being introduced to the main conflict is the rising action, which leads to the climax of the novel. Finish the novel with a resolution that tells how the character deals with the climax.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210123210629/https://www.nownovel.com/blog/7-ways-write-plot-outline/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210722132321/https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201203073050/https://litreactor.com/columns/8-ways-to-outline-a-novel&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210123210629/https://www.nownovel.com/blog/7-ways-write-plot-outline/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210722132321/https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201203073050/https://litreactor.com/columns/8-ways-to-outline-a-novel\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1873,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,873&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4558262,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4,558,262&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Decorate a Mason Jar&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To decorate a Mason jar, try spray painting it with metallic paint and turning it into a vase. You could use chalkboard paint instead if you want to write on the jar. Alternatively, try turning your Mason jar into a mosaic by gluing broken tiles, pieces of mirror, or even seashells onto the outside of it. After you glue all the pieces on, simply spread some grout over them, let it sit for 30 minutes, and wipe away the excess. For an easier DIY project, try wrapping some fabric, ribbon, or burlap around the jar. You can secure it by tying a bow, or you can use hot glue for a neater finish.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210122182959/https://www.fun365.orientaltrading.com/project/love-mason-jars-doily-flowers&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117021738/https://getinspiredeveryday.com/lifestyle/burlap-mason-jars/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170808093055/http://www.joann.com:80/how-to-make-a-hearts-desire-doily-ed-jar/4979519P24.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210302042036/https://masonjarcraftslove.com/mosaic-mason-jar/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126051032/https://diyprojects.com/mason-jar-crafts/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126081705/https://homebnc.com/best-diy-mason-jar-crafts-ideas/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190611131028/http://www.northstory.ca/spray-paint-glass-get-angry/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210116235203/https://www.countryliving.com/shopping/antiques/news/a39351/mason-jar-facts/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171114075511/http://spraypaintartsecrets.com:80/airbrush-painting-secrets/safety-and-ventilation/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180905100548/http://www.momtastic.com:80/diy/452951-how-to-decoupage-mason-jars/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210118202346/https://www.kenarry.com/mosaic-wine-bottle-mosaic-tiles-shells/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210122182959/https://www.fun365.orientaltrading.com/project/love-mason-jars-doily-flowers\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117021738/https://getinspiredeveryday.com/lifestyle/burlap-mason-jars/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170808093055/http://www.joann.com:80/how-to-make-a-hearts-desire-doily-ed-jar/4979519P24.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210302042036/https://masonjarcraftslove.com/mosaic-mason-jar/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126051032/https://diyprojects.com/mason-jar-crafts/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210126081705/https://homebnc.com/best-diy-mason-jar-crafts-ideas/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190611131028/http://www.northstory.ca/spray-paint-glass-get-angry/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210116235203/https://www.countryliving.com/shopping/antiques/news/a39351/mason-jar-facts/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171114075511/http://spraypaintartsecrets.com:80/airbrush-painting-secrets/safety-and-ventilation/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180905100548/http://www.momtastic.com:80/diy/452951-how-to-decoupage-mason-jars/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210118202346/https://www.kenarry.com/mosaic-wine-bottle-mosaic-tiles-shells/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2348,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,348&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:61404,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;61,404&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Put a Bracelet on by Yourself&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you’re having trouble putting on a bracelet by yourself, try using tape.

The tape should hold the bracelet in place long enough for you to secure the clasp.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210311133453/https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/01/scotch-tape-bracelet_n_9132628.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200810052324/https://www.today.com/style/how-put-bracelet-yourself-no-existential-meltdown-required-t84766&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200502190750/https://www.womansday.com/style/fashion/advice/a53501/how-to-put-on-bracelets/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210311133453/https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/01/scotch-tape-bracelet_n_9132628.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200810052324/https://www.today.com/style/how-put-bracelet-yourself-no-existential-meltdown-required-t84766\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200502190750/https://www.womansday.com/style/fashion/advice/a53501/how-to-put-on-bracelets/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1760,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,760&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4503505,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4,503,505&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Prepare for an Endoscopy&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To prepare for an endoscopy, follow your doctor's advice, which may include stopping some medications, since they may interfere with the results. Don't eat solids or drink fluids during the 8 hours before your endoscopy to avoid blocking your digestive tract. Additionally, arrange for someone to help you afterwards, since your reaction times and judgement will be impaired by the sedative you need to take. Before you go to the procedure, go to the bathroom, since you'll feel more comfortable on an empty bladder.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171129094411/https://patient.info/health/gastroscopy-endoscopy&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171017232823/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/tests-procedures/endoscopy/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020363&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170630162614/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/tests-procedures/endoscopy/basics/how-you-prepare/prc-20020363&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506165849/https://dhccenter.com/procedure-prep/upper-endoscopy-egd-preparation/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171005010304/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org:80/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gastroenterology/esophagogastroduodenoscopy_92,P07717&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170913164728/http://www.dana-farber.org:80/Health-Library/Understanding-upper-endoscopy-and-colonoscopy.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170213234832/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/diagnostic-tests/upper-gi-endoscopy/Pages/diagnostic-test.aspx&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171129094411/https://patient.info/health/gastroscopy-endoscopy\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171017232823/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/tests-procedures/endoscopy/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020363\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170630162614/http://www.mayoclinic.org:80/tests-procedures/endoscopy/basics/how-you-prepare/prc-20020363\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210506165849/https://dhccenter.com/procedure-prep/upper-endoscopy-egd-preparation/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20171005010304/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org:80/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gastroenterology/esophagogastroduodenoscopy_92,P07717\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170913164728/http://www.dana-farber.org:80/Health-Library/Understanding-upper-endoscopy-and-colonoscopy.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170213234832/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/diagnostic-tests/upper-gi-endoscopy/Pages/diagnostic-test.aspx\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:233,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;233&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:75,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1132291,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,132,291&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Clean a Wooden Chair&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To clean a wooden chair, start by choosing an oil-based or wood-specific cleaner and try to avoid all-purpose cleaning products, which are too harsh.

Try to work with the wood grain to avoid splinters! Finally, let the cleaner sit on the surface for 10-20 minutes and wipe away the excess with the lint-free cloth.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117035726/https://dengarden.com/cleaning/How-to-Clean-Wood-Furniture-Like-a-Professional-Cleaning-Company&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210518110649/https://cleaning.tips.net/T006887_Clean_Wooden_Chairs.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210516060043/https://www.bhg.com/decorating/lessons/furniture-guide/wood-furnishings-care/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509172019/https://www.thriftyfun.com/Cleaning-Wood-Furniture-1.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210512141945/https://www.dummies.com/home-garden/home-improvement/cleaning-stain-removal/how-to-clean-wood-furniture-finishes/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419121435/https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201201144054/http://www.thefurnitureconnoisseur.com/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20191031132620/http://victorcrafter.com:80/clean-wooden-chair-5-easy-ways-classic-look/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170809093503/http://www.howtocleanthings.com:80/furniture/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210117035726/https://dengarden.com/cleaning/How-to-Clean-Wood-Furniture-Like-a-Professional-Cleaning-Company\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210518110649/https://cleaning.tips.net/T006887_Clean_Wooden_Chairs.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210516060043/https://www.bhg.com/decorating/lessons/furniture-guide/wood-furnishings-care/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509172019/https://www.thriftyfun.com/Cleaning-Wood-Furniture-1.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210512141945/https://www.dummies.com/home-garden/home-improvement/cleaning-stain-removal/how-to-clean-wood-furniture-finishes/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210419121435/https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201201144054/http://www.thefurnitureconnoisseur.com/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20191031132620/http://victorcrafter.com:80/clean-wooden-chair-5-easy-ways-classic-look/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170809093503/http://www.howtocleanthings.com:80/furniture/how-to-clean-wood-furniture/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2419,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,419&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:76,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1505685,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,505,685&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Evict a Tenant in Florida&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It’s possible for a landlord to evict a tenant in Florida if they don’t pay rent or if they violate either the law or the lease agreement terms. First, you’ll need to deliver a notice of eviction that’s been pre-approved by the Florida Supreme Court to the tenant. You can find example letters that are approved by the Florida Supreme Court on the Florida Bar website. Once you have an approved notice of eviction, you’ll need to serve it to the tenant on the property. You can either securely post the notice on the door of the premises or you can send the notice to the tenant using certified mail. After the notice has been served, you’ll need to file all of the eviction documents at the county clerk’s office. In most Florida counties, the filing fee is $185.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200927145733/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150415090012/http://www.johnemcmillan.com:80/%20/category/landlords-legal-troubleshooter&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200721073155/https://www.floridabar.org/public/consumer/consumer004/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201203062843/https://evict.com/?page=evictqa&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20191218123948/http://www.escambiaclerk.com:80/clerk/coc_evictions.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125135326/http://www.rhol.com/csu/evictions/Florida/FloridaSteps.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201025090336/https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tenant-defenses-eviction-notices-florida.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200927145733/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150415090012/http://www.johnemcmillan.com:80/%20/category/landlords-legal-troubleshooter\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200721073155/https://www.floridabar.org/public/consumer/consumer004/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201203062843/https://evict.com/?page=evictqa\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20191218123948/http://www.escambiaclerk.com:80/clerk/coc_evictions.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125135326/http://www.rhol.com/csu/evictions/Florida/FloridaSteps.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201025090336/https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tenant-defenses-eviction-notices-florida.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:837,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;837&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:77,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:311856,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;311,856&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Tutor Mathematics&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To tutor math, start by asking your student to work through a problem.

Next, press the outside of each papaya gently with your fingertips to check for hardness. If the fruit is ripe, your fingers should sink slightly into it. Lastly, smell the base to make sure there's a faint, sweet scent near the stem.

Then, type your desired phrase into the search box. Alternatively, if you just want to find out which plate styles are on offer, look for a link on the site about themed plates. Once you’ve found the design of plate you’d like, order it online if your state’s DMV website lets you do this. If it doesn’t, complete an application form and take it to your local DMV office.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210908025534/https://services.flhsmv.gov/MVCheckPersonalPlate/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210911231020/https://dmvnv.com/platespersonalized.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210621183852/https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/how-to-install-a-license-plate/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190227042144/http://www.coolpl8z.com/top-100-best-vanity-license-plate-ideas.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211012153327/https://www.dmv.org/license-plates.php&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161223123830/https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211005213814/https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/dmvnet/plate_purchase/intro.asp&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210908021929/https://pros.mvtrip.alabama.gov/public/create&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211201194629/http://dmvlist.com/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210815063749/https://www1.maine.gov/online/bmv/vanity/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180623051408/http://news.abs-cbn.com:80/video/nation/metro-manila/05/08/14/lto-demonstrates-installation-new-license-plates&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180108011940/http://www.michigan.gov:80/sos/0,4670,7-127-48268-308046--F,00.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210908025534/https://services.flhsmv.gov/MVCheckPersonalPlate/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210911231020/https://dmvnv.com/platespersonalized.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210621183852/https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/how-to-install-a-license-plate/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190227042144/http://www.coolpl8z.com/top-100-best-vanity-license-plate-ideas.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211012153327/https://www.dmv.org/license-plates.php\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161223123830/https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211005213814/https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/dmvnet/plate_purchase/intro.asp\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210908021929/https://pros.mvtrip.alabama.gov/public/create\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211201194629/http://dmvlist.com/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210815063749/https://www1.maine.gov/online/bmv/vanity/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180623051408/http://news.abs-cbn.com:80/video/nation/metro-manila/05/08/14/lto-demonstrates-installation-new-license-plates\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180108011940/http://www.michigan.gov:80/sos/0,4670,7-127-48268-308046--F,00.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:213,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;213&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:81,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:5102891,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;5,102,891&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make a Guy Crazy About You&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To attract the attention of a guy and make him fall for you, start off by flaunting some charm.

Once you’ve caught his attention, turn up the charm by showing him who you are. Confidently tell him about your interests and invite him to participate in your favorite activities. For example, if you paint you could invite take him to a painting class or art museum. Or if you play a sport, invite him to watch a game. Remember to stay true to yourself. You want him to go crazy for you, not a made-up version of you. Don't pretend to be interested in things you're not interested in, dress in ways that you don't like, or engage in activities you don't enjoy for the sake of a guy.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200221081131/http://youqueen.com:80/love/seduction/8-ways-to-make-him-go-crazy-over-you&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200607092730/https://allwomenstalk.com/10-ways-to-make-a-guy-go-crazy-over-you/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170707161420/http://thoughtcatalog.com:80/derek-marshall/2013/10/15-quirks-girls-have-that-guys-go-crazy-over/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180818001705/http://www.womanin.me:80/10-tips-on-how-to-make-a-guy-go-crazy-over-you/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200221081131/http://youqueen.com:80/love/seduction/8-ways-to-make-him-go-crazy-over-you\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200607092730/https://allwomenstalk.com/10-ways-to-make-a-guy-go-crazy-over-you/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170707161420/http://thoughtcatalog.com:80/derek-marshall/2013/10/15-quirks-girls-have-that-guys-go-crazy-over/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180818001705/http://www.womanin.me:80/10-tips-on-how-to-make-a-guy-go-crazy-over-you/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1855,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,855&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:82,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7303889,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7,303,889&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Keep Cats Off Furniture&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To keep cats off of furniture, try placing some aluminum foil or double-sided tape on the furniture, which cats don't like to step on.

If that doesn't work, try changing positions by standing up or lying down, if you were previously sitting. You can also use one of the most time-tested strategies for holding in farts by leaning slightly forward in a chair with your weight on your toes. For the best results, place both of your hands on the armrests and lift your butt off the seat as you lean forward. However, keep in mind that holding in farts can cause bloating and cramps, so holding them should only be used as a short-term strategy. When you need to release a fart, you can make it as quiet as possible by releasing it as slowly as you can.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211124013335/https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/rm-quiz-fart-quiz&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210421183906/https://www.oprah.com/health/your-questions-answered&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211124013335/https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/rm-quiz-fart-quiz\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210421183906/https://www.oprah.com/health/your-questions-answered\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1298,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,298&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:84,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7132850,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7,132,850&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Get Cat Urine Out of a Mattress&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To get cat urine out of your mattress, start by blotting the urine with paper towels to absorb as much of it as possible.

Once you have a list, narrow it down to a few words or phrases to make them the focal point of the song, and make connections between the words that you choose.

plant that you can easily take care of at home. Make sure your plant gets plenty of indirect sunlight, and keep it somewhere warm and humid. Water your plant once a week or whenever the top of the soil is dry. You'll also want to periodically wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove any spider mites, mealy bugs, or other pests that could feed on the leaves. Once the plant is fully grown, you may notice that some of the leaves near the bottom of the cane have turned brown or are dried out.

Next, dip the coins in a solution of dish soap and water, then softly rub the coin with your thumb and index finger to dislodge any dirt. If the coins are particularly dirty, you can soak them in the soapy water for a few minutes, then brush them with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Dry each coin with a towel and store them in a dry place. If your coins are collectible, cleaning may reduce their coins’ value, so check with a professional before you clean them.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210913224732/https://www.coinnews.net/2007/09/03/what-is-coin-toning-how-does-it-affect-coins-and-their-value-3565/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210125110632/https://coinsite.com/how-much-does-light-wiping-andor-cleaning-detract-from-the-value-of-silver-coins/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509165329/https://www.drinkmorewater.com/distilled-or-purified-water&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201024040017/https://www.numismaticnews.net/article/scratches-vary-in-severity-on-coins&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211125202721/https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-isopropyl-alcohol-uses-structure-formula.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211102205036/https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-grading/details-grading/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210913224732/https://www.coinnews.net/2007/09/03/what-is-coin-toning-how-does-it-affect-coins-and-their-value-3565/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210125110632/https://coinsite.com/how-much-does-light-wiping-andor-cleaning-detract-from-the-value-of-silver-coins/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509165329/https://www.drinkmorewater.com/distilled-or-purified-water\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201024040017/https://www.numismaticnews.net/article/scratches-vary-in-severity-on-coins\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211125202721/https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-isopropyl-alcohol-uses-structure-formula.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211102205036/https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-grading/details-grading/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2040,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,040&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:92,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:207493,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;207,493&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Know the Earliest Pregnancy Signs&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It can be hard to know if you’re pregnant during the first few weeks, but there are some early signs you can watch for. A common early sign of pregnancy is a lack of overall energy, even when you haven’t changed your routine or sleep schedule. You may also notice that you have an aversion to certain foods or drinks or that you don’t like the smell of things you previously enjoyed. Pregnancy hormones can trigger changes in mood early on, so notice if you get angry or frustrated more quickly or if you find yourself crying more easily. Another early sign of pregnancy is mild uterine cramping or tender breasts, though these, like many other signs, can also be experienced just before your period. If you suspect you’re pregnant, pick up a home pregnancy test and take it in the morning when your hormone levels are at their highest. If you get a positive, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm your pregnancy.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511150217/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20044882&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210427152148/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210502015336/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853?pg=2&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507221822/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853?pg=1&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210917170423/https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/understanding-pregnancy-tests/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180516153456/https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnancy-test&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511215115/https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/signs/symptoms/signs-you-may-be-pregnant/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210321105829/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a25007925/pregnancy-signs-at-two-weeks&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200814011735/https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/early-pregnancy-symptoms/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511150217/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20044882\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210427152148/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210502015336/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853?pg=2\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210507221822/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853?pg=1\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210917170423/https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/understanding-pregnancy-tests/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180516153456/https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnancy-test\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511215115/https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/signs/symptoms/signs-you-may-be-pregnant/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210321105829/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a25007925/pregnancy-signs-at-two-weeks\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200814011735/https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/early-pregnancy-symptoms/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:286,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;286&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2130837,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,130,837&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Identify a Water Spider&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To identify a water spider, look for a spider with a brown and velvety-looking body that's 10-15 millimeters in length.

Alternatively, if you want to make the slime softer, try adding a little more glue! &quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201112025842/https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/elmers-clear-glue-slime-recipe-kids/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125030450/https://asubtlerevelry.com/clear-slime-recipe/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201112025842/https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/elmers-clear-glue-slime-recipe-kids/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201125030450/https://asubtlerevelry.com/clear-slime-recipe/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2145,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,145&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:294941,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;294,941&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make Someone Stop Liking You&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It can be awkward to be around someone who has a crush on you if you don’t like them in that way, but you can try to make them stop liking you by being direct and maintaining boundaries. Be confident in your decision that you don’t want a relationship with this person so you don’t send mixed signals. You’ll also want to set appropriate boundaries, like not touching or flirting with the person, unfollowing them on social media, avoiding spending one-on-one time with them, and saying “no” to any plans they try to make with you. If they don’t respect your boundaries or can’t seem to take the hint, have an in-person talk. Be clear and firm that you’re not interested. Even though your aim is to get them to stop liking you, still be nice by understanding their feelings and perspective.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511231410/https://www.seventeen.com/love/dating-advice/a36510/how-to-break-up/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161122151817/http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk:80/entertainment/a33549/facebook-tricks-tips-hacks-easier/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210411223538/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-breakup&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210516182802/https://www.womansday.com/relationships/dating-marriage/advice/a1388/10-things-that-turn-men-off-104649/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210121174123/https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/how-to-sabotage-your-relationship-and-get-them-to-break-up-with-you-instead/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200221134816/http://www.nbcnews.com:80/id/12818892/ns/business-forbes_com/t/warding-goo-goo-eyes&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210116090350/https://www.businessinsider.com/things-that-make-people-dislike-you-2015-10&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210517033733/https://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/how-to-deal-with-a-coworker-who-has-a-crush-on-you.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511211357/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/9959655/How-to-break-up-with-someone.html&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511231410/https://www.seventeen.com/love/dating-advice/a36510/how-to-break-up/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161122151817/http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk:80/entertainment/a33549/facebook-tricks-tips-hacks-easier/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210411223538/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-breakup\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210516182802/https://www.womansday.com/relationships/dating-marriage/advice/a1388/10-things-that-turn-men-off-104649/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210121174123/https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/how-to-sabotage-your-relationship-and-get-them-to-break-up-with-you-instead/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200221134816/http://www.nbcnews.com:80/id/12818892/ns/business-forbes_com/t/warding-goo-goo-eyes\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210116090350/https://www.businessinsider.com/things-that-make-people-dislike-you-2015-10\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210517033733/https://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/how-to-deal-with-a-coworker-who-has-a-crush-on-you.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210511211357/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/9959655/How-to-break-up-with-someone.html\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1816,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,816&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:96,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:168040,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;168,040&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Make a New Bar of Soap from Used Bars of Soap&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;If you want to make a new bar of soap out of the remnants of old bars of soap, grate or cut the old soap into small pieces and place the pieces into the top part of a double boiler. Pour water into the bottom of the double boiler, then add a little water, tea, or milk into the soap. Slowly heat the soap on medium-high until it’s melted, stirring every 5 minutes or so, for 1-2 hours. When the soap is melted, scoop it into a mold. Tap the mold on your table or counter several times to release any air bubbles, then allow the soap to dry for 1-2 days.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418234817/http://frugalkiwi.co.nz/2011/10/how-to-hand-mill-aka-rebatch-soap/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509075332/https://naturallyhandcrafted.com/soap/hot-process-soap/rebatch-soap-and-hand-milled-soap-recipe/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420022458/https://www.savvyhomemade.com/rebatching-soap/&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161129111732/http://www.essentiallyeclectic.com:80/2014/01/cinnamon-hazelnut-coffee-soap.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211027181735/https://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/rebatch-soap-plastic-baggie-technique-2/&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210418234817/http://frugalkiwi.co.nz/2011/10/how-to-hand-mill-aka-rebatch-soap/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210509075332/https://naturallyhandcrafted.com/soap/hot-process-soap/rebatch-soap-and-hand-milled-soap-recipe/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210420022458/https://www.savvyhomemade.com/rebatching-soap/\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161129111732/http://www.essentiallyeclectic.com:80/2014/01/cinnamon-hazelnut-coffee-soap.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211027181735/https://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/rebatch-soap-plastic-baggie-technique-2/\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:-1,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:7097407,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;7,097,407&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Care for American Shorthair Cats&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To care for an American Shorthair cat, feed it 2 to 3 meals per day so it doesn’t get hungry. You should also change its water and clean its food bowl every day to avoid bacteria building up. Remember to brush your cat’s coat thoroughly once a week, which will help keep it smooth and avoid excessive shedding. Since American Shorthairs are a sociable breed of cat, set aside time to play with your cat by throwing toy mice or dangling a feather. If your cat is young, take it to the vet for its vaccinations, and ensure you return for a check-up at least once a year.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210125063103/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200128173218/http://www.cfa.org:80/Breeds/BreedsAB/AmericanShorthair.aspx&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201229181916/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201124151935/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-grooming-tips&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210113070550/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210125063103/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200128173218/http://www.cfa.org:80/Breeds/BreedsAB/AmericanShorthair.aspx\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201229181916/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201124151935/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-grooming-tips\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210113070550/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2351,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,351&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;article_id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2688008,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;2,688,008&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How To Care for a Jack Russell&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To care for your Jack Russell, exercise it for 30 to 45 minutes each day to help manage its high energy levels.

After drinking your water or milk, suck on an ice cube for 5 to 10 minutes to keep your mouth cold and prevent further burning. Once your mouth is cool, disinfect the burn by mixing ½ teaspoon of salt with warm water and rinsing your mouth with the solution. While the burn heals, continue to rinse with salt water once or twice a day. You’ll also want to avoid popping any blisters, which can slow the healing process and lead to infection.&quot;},&quot;related_document_urls_wayback_snapshots&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211211203044/https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-treat-a-roof-of-mouth-burn&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210831063446/https://www.healthline.com/health/tongue-burn&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160705041212/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003059.htm&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200224053432/http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com:80/askquestion/600/cure-for-burnt-tongue-after-drinking-hot-coffee-ho.html&quot;,&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211006174357/https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-blisters/basics/art-20056691&quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211211203044/https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-treat-a-roof-of-mouth-burn\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210831063446/https://www.healthline.com/health/tongue-burn\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160705041212/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003059.htm\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200224053432/http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com:80/askquestion/600/cure-for-burnt-tongue-after-drinking-hot-coffee-ho.html\&quot;,\n  \&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20211006174357/https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-blisters/basics/art-20056691\&quot;\n]&quot;},&quot;split&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;class label&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;train&quot;},&quot;cluster&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1920,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,920&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:8235,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzEyNywic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0x1cnVuY2hpay9XaWtpSG93TkZRQSIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjcyNywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.h76IaEUgi0p4sVi3Jbt3LHwLsqMcInB-uB36Bw70lioTVEwXQv3G1qgcgGm8WQE-qb1H6pXaVMN4qeRBmQUXCA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;Lurunchik/WikiHowNFQA&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;60cc03e0f8e062152b10e256&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1623983071307-noauth.png&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Valeriia&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Lurunchik&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

You can also sear the pork tenderloin on both sides in a skillet before putting it in the oven, which will reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes. If you want to grill pork tenderloin, start by preheating the grill to medium-high heat. Then, cook the tenderloin on the grill for 30-40 minutes over indirect heat, flipping it occasionally.</span></div></div>

Alternatively, add ¾ of a cup of baking soda to your bath and soak for 15-20 minutes to help restore your skin’s pH balance. You can also try applying vinegar, whole milk, or mint leaves to your peeling skin, all of which can help stop peeling.

Two months before you plan to nurse, you can stimulate milk production by using a breast pump 3 times a day for 5 minutes at a time. After you’ve pumped for 2 days, slowly increase your pumping frequency until you’re pumping for 10 minutes every 4 hours. Then, increase the frequency so you’re pumping every 2 to 3 hours for 15 to 20 minutes. You'll also need to pump at least once during the nighttime, so try setting an alarm to help you remember.</span></div></div>

Next, soak the diapers in the mixture for around 6 hours, stirring them around occasionally to help release the minerals in the fabric.

Then, wrap a towel around the ball of your foot and gently pull on the ends of the fabric to stretch your leg back. If the cramp is on the front of your thigh, stand up and stretch the muscle by grabbing your foot and pulling it back towards your behind. Walk around between stretches to relax the muscle. If you get thigh cramps often, try to drink more water and get plenty of potassium in your diet to avoid them in the future.</span></div></div>

First, draw or print your design on regular printer paper. Make sure the height of your design is less than the width of your packing tape, usually 3 inches (8 cm). Cover the front of your design with packing tape to give it a glossy, sticker-like feel. Then, use a pair of scissors to cut the sticker out. Leave a little excess paper around your design for later. Next, pull out the roll of double-sided tape with the uncovered sticky side facing up. Place your sticker on the double-sided tape with the design facing away from the sticky side. Press down to flatten the design against the tape. Finally, cut around your design to remove the excess tape and paper. When you want to use your sticker, just peel the cover off of the double-sided tape and press the sticker down against a flat surface.</span></div></div>

Next, add live plants, such as moss and fern, to provide food for your shrimp, as well as an LED tank light to help your plants thrive. Finally, let your tank run for at least 2 weeks to establish a bacteria base in the water and filters before adding your shrimp.</span></div></div>

Alternatively, to give your cat medicine without food, wrap your cat in a towel with its head exposed, open its mouth, and put the pill or liquid toward the back of the tongue.

Once your dog is barking on command, place a treat in front of its nose while it's barking to get it to stop and sniff. Then, say “quiet” as soon as it stops barking, and give it the reward.

To create one, start by writing down 5 keywords that describe your idea or concept. if your mood board is about antique-themed weddings, for example, you might write lace, light blue, ivory, wood, and silver. Once you have your concept, gather images from magazines, newspapers, or print them off the internet and organize them by color, shape, material, texture, or mood. Then, glue or tape them onto a large cardboard canvas or pin them up on your wall. Try moving the images around, placing the largest, most important ones in the center and the others on the edges.</span></div></div>

Once the finish or paint has dried, attach the strips to the wall by hammering in the nails along the strip. Afterwards, hammer in 2 upholstery nails into each corner of the rug, and use a third nail to secure the midpoint between each corner.</span></div></div>

Then, place both of your hands on the back of your head, and slowly lean back in the chair until your back cracks. Move forward in your seat to crack higher up on your back, or move backward to crack lower on your back. However you crack your back, remember to be gentle and move slowly so you don’t hurt yourself. If you’re experiencing back pain, talk to your doctor before attempting to crack your back on your own.</span></div></div>

You might write, “I would love to meet with you to discuss how I can be an asset to your company.” Additionally, provide a two week window of time when you’re available, but don’t specify a particular time because the interviewer may be unavailable then.</span></div></div>

If you’re unable to escape the path of the avalanche, try to grab on to a boulder or sturdy tree. Alternatively, work to stay toward the surface of the snow by kicking your feet and trashing your arms as if you’re swimming. In order to survive if you have been buried, dig a pocket around your face to breath into. Additionally, try to stick one arm straight up toward the snow’s surface to orient yourself and to hopefully be seen by rescuers.</span></div></div>

Next, split your room into a dry side and a wet side, with the dry side being for your electrical equipment and the wet side for developing photos. When your room is ready, bring in a table and your equipment, including your enlarger, chemicals, and printing kit. Finally, set up your funnel, trays, and film clips on the wet side and reels, easel, and safe light on the dry side.</span></div></div>

Heat up your grill so the temperature is between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Brush the grill with a little vegetable oil to keep the brats from sticking. Once the grill is hot, lay the sausages vertically along the grate. Grill your brats for 15 to 20 minutes, turning them every 3 to 5 minutes to make sure they cook evenly. A perfectly cooked brat will turn dull reddish-brown when it’s done, but to make sure, you’ll want to use a meat thermometer. The temperature should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To get sweat stains out of your bra, try using baking soda. First, mix it with water to make a paste. Then, rub it onto the stained areas of your bra. Leave it in the sun for a few hours to help the baking soda work. After the baking soda paste has dried, gently peel it off your bra. Machine wash your bra like normal to remove any leftover paste and to help it smell fresh. Alternatively, use regular dish detergent to get the stains out. However, this only works on white bras, as the detergent can discolor dyed bras. First, pour a small amount of detergent onto the stains and rub it in with your fingers or an old toothbrush. Once you’ve rubbed detergent in, wash your bra in cold water to remove the soap.</span></div></div>

You should also make sure your dog has a behavioral issue that pheromones can effectively treat, like anxiety or aggression. Before applying pheromones to your dog or its environment, speak to your vet to make sure they don’t have any medical concerns. If you want to give your dog pheromones for short periods of time, opt for a spray, which usually needs to be sprayed around the room every 4 hours. For a longer term option, purchase a diffuser or collar containing pheromones, which can last up to a month.</span></div></div>

digest. If it’s still green, it’s not ripe enough yet. When it turns 
yellow, the banana is ripe enough to eat. It will be sweetest when there 
are a few light brown spots on the peel. To peel the banana, snap back the 
stalk at the top of the fruit, then pull it downwards. Pull the rest of the 
skin off in similar strips. You can also peel the banana from the blossom 
end which is the flat, brown stub at the end of the banana. Pinch just 
behind the blossom end to break it apart, then peel the skin off the 
banana. Eat the fruit whole or cut it into pieces. For a healthy breakfast, 
add banana pieces to a smoothie, cereal, yogurt, or oatmeal. For something 
sweeter, dip whole or sliced bananas in melted chocolate. </span></div></div>

Alternatively, if you have to move your head, make sure you move the microphone as well.

Next, set up a desk for all of your sound equipment. Finally, put your instruments and microphones in a designated section of the room for the recording space.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To paint metal, first put on a dust mask and some thick gloves. If you can, take your metal surface outside. Otherwise, put a drop cloth underneath it. Then, scrub the metal with coarse sandpaper to remove any rust or old paint. If you item is rusty, apply a rust converter and scrub the metal with a wire brush if the rust won't come off with just the sandpaper. Wipe the metal with a damp cloth to get any dust or debris off of the surface, then let it air dry. Next, fill a paint tray with metal primer, and use a brush or roller to apply an even coat to the metal surface. Wait at least 24 hours for the primer to dry. Now, fill a clean paint tray with an oil-based paint designed for metal. Apply the paint using a brush or roller, starting with the exterior edges to paint the trim before working your way to the easier, flatter sections. Finally, wait at least 12 hours to let the paint dry before handling the metal. For textured metals, use a spray primer instead of liquid primer. Hold the can 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) away from your sanded metal and coat the entire surface. Wait 24 hours for the primer to dry before spray painting the metal with your top coat.</span></div></div>

Then, cut any ingredients that need cutting, like lemon and cucumber, into small chunks or slices to release their flavors. Once you’ve cut your ingredients, fill a jug with water and add your fruits, vegetables, and herbs. To finish your detox water, give it a stir and store it in the refrigerator for 12 hours before you serve it to infuse all of the flavors.</span></div></div>

If her family are around while you’re there, avoid physical contact with her to avoid any awkwardness. You might be nervous about what they’ll think of you, but try to relax and be yourself so they can see the person you really are.

Visit your local city or county’s police department website. Next, locate the arrest records section and enter the personal information of the person you’re looking for.

Not only will this make you seem cute, but it will give you an air of mystery that makes things more exciting. Additionally, don’t forget to smile, since a charming smile goes a long way. Besides acting cute, you can try out a new, cute haircut! If you have a favorite celebrity or athlete, consider getting a hair cut similar to theirs.

Also, try adding lemon to your drinks, because in addition to antiviral and antibacterial properties, lemons contain a lot of vitamin C. For a sore or irritated throat, gargle warm salt water. By gargling a mixture of 6 ounces of warm water and 1 teaspoon of salt, you can reduce the swelling in your throat and lessen your cough.</span></div></div>

Then, bake the skin at 250 degrees F. After 3 hours, remove the pork from the oven and heat some lard or peanut oil in a pan until it bubbles. Finally, fry the skins in batches for about 1 minute or until they're puffy.</span></div></div>

When you’re choosing a pot or container, pick one that is at least 4 inches taller than the container your gardenia came in so it has more room to grow. Fill the pot with a soil that drains well such as one that includes peat moss or sand to help with drainage. Place your gardenias in a location that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight each day, but is out of direct sunlight, such as a windowsill or near a shady tree in your yard. Water your gardenias about once or twice a week, when the soil is dry below the surface.</span></div></div>

If you’d like to create a narrative outline, start by determining your novel’s opening scene. Next, come up with an inciting incident, or something that happens to set your main character on a specific path. From there, determine the main conflict, which is an intense issue that the character has to address or deal with. Whatever the character does after being introduced to the main conflict is the rising action, which leads to the climax of the novel. Finish the novel with a resolution that tells how the character deals with the climax.</span></div></div>

You could use chalkboard paint instead if you want to write on the jar. Alternatively, try turning your Mason jar into a mosaic by gluing broken tiles, pieces of mirror, or even seashells onto the outside of it. After you glue all the pieces on, simply spread some grout over them, let it sit for 30 minutes, and wipe away the excess. For an easier DIY project, try wrapping some fabric, ribbon, or burlap around the jar. You can secure it by tying a bow, or you can use hot glue for a neater finish.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">It’s possible for a landlord to evict a tenant in Florida if they don’t pay rent or if they violate either the law or the lease agreement terms. First, you’ll need to deliver a notice of eviction that’s been pre-approved by the Florida Supreme Court to the tenant. You can find example letters that are approved by the Florida Supreme Court on the Florida Bar website. Once you have an approved notice of eviction, you’ll need to serve it to the tenant on the property. You can either securely post the notice on the door of the premises or you can send the notice to the tenant using certified mail. After the notice has been served, you’ll need to file all of the eviction documents at the county clerk’s office. In most Florida counties, the filing fee is $185.</span></div></div>

Lastly, smell the base to make sure there's a faint, sweet scent near the stem.

Then, type your desired phrase into the search box. Alternatively, if you just want to find out which plate styles are on offer, look for a link on the site about themed plates. Once you’ve found the design of plate you’d like, order it online if your state’s DMV website lets you do this. If it doesn’t, complete an application form and take it to your local DMV office.</span></div></div>

Once you’ve caught his attention, turn up the charm by showing him who you are. Confidently tell him about your interests and invite him to participate in your favorite activities. For example, if you paint you could invite take him to a painting class or art museum. Or if you play a sport, invite him to watch a game. Remember to stay true to yourself. You want him to go crazy for you, not a made-up version of you. Don't pretend to be interested in things you're not interested in, dress in ways that you don't like, or engage in activities you don't enjoy for the sake of a guy.</span></div></div>

If that doesn't work, try changing positions by standing up or lying down, if you were previously sitting. You can also use one of the most time-tested strategies for holding in farts by leaning slightly forward in a chair with your weight on your toes. For the best results, place both of your hands on the armrests and lift your butt off the seat as you lean forward. However, keep in mind that holding in farts can cause bloating and cramps, so holding them should only be used as a short-term strategy. When you need to release a fart, you can make it as quiet as possible by releasing it as slowly as you can.</span></div></div>

Make sure your plant gets plenty of indirect sunlight, and keep it somewhere warm and humid. Water your plant once a week or whenever the top of the soil is dry. You'll also want to periodically wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove any spider mites, mealy bugs, or other pests that could feed on the leaves. Once the plant is fully grown, you may notice that some of the leaves near the bottom of the cane have turned brown or are dried out. Pluck the old leave by hand to help the plant shed its old foliage in preparation for new growth.</span></div></div>

A common early sign of pregnancy is a lack of overall energy, even when you haven’t changed your routine or sleep schedule. You may also notice that you have an aversion to certain foods or drinks or that you don’t like the smell of things you previously enjoyed. Pregnancy hormones can trigger changes in mood early on, so notice if you get angry or frustrated more quickly or if you find yourself crying more easily. Another early sign of pregnancy is mild uterine cramping or tender breasts, though these, like many other signs, can also be experienced just before your period. If you suspect you’re pregnant, pick up a home pregnancy test and take it in the morning when your hormone levels are at their highest. If you get a positive, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm your pregnancy.</span></div></div>

Be confident in your decision that you don’t want a relationship with this person so you don’t send mixed signals. You’ll also want to set appropriate boundaries, like not touching or flirting with the person, unfollowing them on social media, avoiding spending one-on-one time with them, and saying “no” to any plans they try to make with you. If they don’t respect your boundaries or can’t seem to take the hint, have an in-person talk. Be clear and firm that you’re not interested. Even though your aim is to get them to stop liking you, still be nice by understanding their feelings and perspective.</span></div></div>

Pour water into the bottom of the double boiler, then add a little water, tea, or milk into the soap. Slowly heat the soap on medium-high until it’s melted, stirring every 5 minutes or so, for 1-2 hours. When the soap is melted, scoop it into a mold. Tap the mold on your table or counter several times to release any air bubbles, then allow the soap to dry for 1-2 days.</span></div></div>

You should also change its water and clean its food bowl every day to avoid bacteria building up. Remember to brush your cat’s coat thoroughly once a week, which will help keep it smooth and avoid excessive shedding. Since American Shorthairs are a sociable breed of cat, set aside time to play with your cat by throwing toy mice or dangling a feather. If your cat is young, take it to the vet for its vaccinations, and ensure you return for a check-up at least once a year.</span></div></div>

After drinking your water or milk, suck on an ice cube for 5 to 10 minutes to keep your mouth cold and prevent further burning. Once your mouth is cool, disinfect the burn by mixing ½ teaspoon of salt with warm water and rinsing your mouth with the solution. While the burn heals, continue to rinse with salt water once or twice a day. You’ll also want to avoid popping any blisters, which can slow the healing process and lead to infection.</span></div></div>

<p>The WikiHowQA dataset is divided into two parts: the QA part and the Document Content part.
The QA part of the dataset contains questions, answers, and only links to web archive snapshots of related HTML pages and can be downloaded here. 
The Document Content part contains parsed HTML content and is accessible by request and signing a Data Transfer Agreement with RMIT University.</p>
<p>Each dataset instance includes a question, a set of related documents, and a human-authored answer. The questions are non-factoid, requiring comprehensive, multi-sentence answers. The related documents provide the necessary information to generate an answer.</p>

		Social Impact of the Dataset
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The WikiHowQA dataset is a rich resource for researchers interested in question answering, information retrieval, and natural language understanding tasks. It can help in developing models that provide comprehensive answers to how-to questions, which can be beneficial in various applications such as customer support, tutoring systems, and personal assistants. However, as with any dataset, the potential for misuse or unintended consequences exists. For example, a model trained on this dataset might be used to generate misleading or incorrect answers if not properly validated.</p>

		Discussion of Biases
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The WikiHowQA dataset is derived from WikiHow, a community-driven platform. While WikiHow has guidelines to ensure the quality and neutrality of its content, biases could still be present due to the demographic and ideological characteristics of its contributors. Users of the dataset should be aware of this potential bias.</p>

		Other Known Limitations
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The dataset only contains 'how-to' questions and their answers. Therefore, it may not be suitable for tasks that require understanding of other types of questions (e.g., why, what, when, who, etc.). Additionally, while the dataset contains a large number of instances, there may still be topics or types of questions that are underrepresented.</p>

		Data Loading
	</span>
</h2>
<p>There are two primary ways to load the QA dataset part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directly from the file (if you have the .jsonl file locally, you can load the dataset using the following Python code):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> json

dataset = []
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'wikiHowNFQA.jsonl'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> l <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        dataset.append(json.loads(l))
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in a list of dictionaries, each representing a single instance in the dataset.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>From the Hugging Face Datasets Hub:</li>
</ol>
<p>If the dataset is hosted on the Hugging Face Datasets Hub, you can load it directly using the datasets library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> datasets <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset(<span class="hljs-string">'wikiHowNFQA'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>This will return a DatasetDict object, which is a dictionary-like object that maps split names (e.g., 'train', 'validation', 'test') to Dataset objects. You can access a specific split like so: dataset['train'].</p>
