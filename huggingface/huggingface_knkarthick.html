My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.\n#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?\n#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.\n#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.\n#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!\n#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.\n#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.\n#Person2#: You have always been so soft, Dave!\n#Person1#: Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.\n#Person2#: Anyway. . . That's all for today folks!

How much is a new battery?\n#Person2#: It's $5 and we not only change a battery, but also guarantee it for a year and if you have the watch cleaned here, we can guarantee it for an additional 3 months.\n#Person1#: That sounds like a good deal. I'll get my battery here. When will it be ready?\n#Person2#: Usually I can do it right away, but now I'm repairing lots of watches. Can you leave your watch here until 5:00 PM?\n#Person1#: OK.

I eat it at least twice a week, it be good to have something different.\n#Person2#: Well, there's that Chinese restaurant. The bamboo house.\n#Person1#: It's closing next week for a month.

Some people will want to go to a cheap place, and others can afford somewhere more expensive.\n#Person2#: Why don't we fix the amount first and ask a restaurant to provide a meal for that price?\n#Person1#: That's a good idea.

I was planning to end my trip in Italy, but it didn't work out.\n#Person1#: Oh well, is it good to be back?\n#Person2#: Of course, but I'm returning to France to finish my degree.

#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.
#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.
#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?
#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.
#Person2#: Ok.
#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?
#Person2#: Yes.
#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.
#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.
#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.
#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.</span></div></div>

#Person2#: You know, I was thinking about doing that, but more than 30 books came up when I typed in 'movie studios'.
#Person1#: You could cut that down even further by listing the specific years you want. Try adding '1930s' or '1940s' or maybe 'Golden Age'.
#Person2#: 'Golden Age' is a good idea, Let me type that in. Hey, look, just 6 books this time That's a lot better.
#Person1#: Oh, another thing you might consider. Have you tried looking for any magazines or newspaper articles?
#Person2#: No, I've only been searching for books.
#Person1#: Well, you can look up magazine articles in the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.
#Person2#: You have always been so soft, Dave!
#Person1#: Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.
#Person2#: Anyway. . . That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about &amp; quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days &amp; quot, I'm sure you'll love that one Dave!</span></div></div>

#Person2#: 250 a week, plus of course, you're responsible for all fees including gas, water and electricity.
#Person1#: It said 200 in the ad.
#Person2#: Yeah, but that was for the small room upstairs and that's already gone.
#Person1#: Well, 250 is a bit too much for me.
#Person2#: Well this is London. And it is your own place...good location, near the Tube.
#Person1#: Look...I can stretch to 200 a week...I can't afford 250 plus all the other bills.
#Person2#: All right. One month's rent in advance, plus a month's deposit. That'll be 400 cash. This is the contract...read through it, initial each page and then sign at the bottom...
#Person1#: OK.</span></div></div>

<p>DialogSum is a large-scale dialogue summarization dataset, consisting of 13,460 dialogues (+1000 tests) split into train, test and validation.
The first instance in the training set:
{'id': 'train_0', 'summary': "Mr. Smith's getting a check-up, and Doctor Hawkins advises him to have one every year. Hawkins'll give some information about their classes and medications to help Mr. Smith quit smoking.", 'dialogue': "#Person1#: Hi, Mr. Smith. I'm Doctor Hawkins. Why are you here today?\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.", 'topic': "get a check-up}</p>

		Curation Rationale
	</span>
</h3>
<p>In paper:
We collect dialogue data for DialogSum from three public dialogue corpora, namely Dailydialog (Li et al., 2017), DREAM (Sun et al., 2019) and MuTual (Cui et al., 2019), as well as an English speaking practice website. These datasets contain face-to-face spoken dialogues that cover a wide range of daily-life topics, including schooling, work, medication, shopping, leisure, travel. Most conversations take place between friends, colleagues, and between service providers and customers.</p>
<p>Compared with previous datasets, dialogues from DialogSum have distinct characteristics:</p>
<p>Under rich real-life scenarios, including more diverse task-oriented scenarios;
Have clear communication patterns and intents, which is valuable to serve as summarization sources;
Have a reasonable length, which comforts the purpose of automatic summarization.</p>
<p>We ask annotators to summarize each dialogue based on the following criteria:
Convey the most salient information;
Be brief;
Preserve important named entities within the conversation;
Be written from an observer perspective;
Be written in formal language.</p>
