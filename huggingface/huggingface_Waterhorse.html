Once I encountered an opponent who used a very early a6 in his Sicilian Opening. \n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6\n\nWhat could have been his objective with this move and how should I have have countered it?\n\nA: The point of ...a6 is to control the square b5 where white can otherwise place a knight or bishop at some point. Another point is to prepare b7-b5 followed by Bc8-b7 and perhaps b5-b4 to chase a white Nc3. The move ...a6 appears in at least two variations, 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6; 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6. If you have ever been interested in the gambit 1.e4 c5 2.b4, then you can consider 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 3.b4.\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 3.b4 cxb4 4.a3 bxa3 5.Bxa3\n\n\nA: This is called the O'Kelly variation of the Sicilian.\nIf white plays normally (i.e. 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3), then black can eventually kick the d4 knight with ...e5 when the knight doesn't have any great squares.  In this case, 2... a6 keeps the knight from moving to the natural b5 square (as in the Sveshnikov Sicilian).  This will allow black to quickly play ...d5 with equality.\nWhite's best plan is to play either c3 or c4 trying to prove that black's move 2... a6 is not a good developing move.  When white plays c3, the natural plan is to follow up with d4, and then if black plays ...cxd4, white will respond with cxd4, gaining a classical pawn center.  When white plays c4 instead, white's plan is to set up a Maroczy bind.\nAn unambitious plan for white would be to play into a closed Sicilian - in the closed Sicilian, black frequently plays a6-b5 in order to get counterplay on the queenside.  Furthermore, in the closed Sicilian, tempi matter a lot less because the position will not change radically from one move to the next.\n\nA: As I understand it, the purpose of 2... a6 is to keep a white piece (usually knight or bishop) off b5.\nIt seems premature, because white might not want to go there anyway (for some time). Meaning that it could easily become a wasted move.\nAs White, I would concentrate on king side development, knowing that b5 was \&quot;off limits,\&quot; but not caring, because I have \&quot;better\&quot; things to do.\nOne disadvantage of a6 is that Black may want to play a5 later to try to \&quot;chase\&quot; a White knight on b3. But if he does so, he would have wasted a move with a6. As White, I might try to \&quot;transpose\&quot; into that variation so that Black has wasted a move.\n\nA: a6 serves three purpose .\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a waiting move in Sicilian as like Black waits for White's Plan . \n\n*It is the start of Q-Side Counter Play from black . As in Sicilian Black generally plays on the Center &amp; Q-side .\n\n*Generally in Sicilian the Black Queen's favourite Square is c7 . You may see this move in Kan/Taimanov/Najdorf etc . When Black Plays a6 then it covers the b5 Square which prevents White's Knight to come to b5 and attack the c7 Queen which costs a Tempo to Black .\n\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/1\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;38\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Is there a way to use handicaps in chess to bridge the gap between players of different skill levels? Handicapping is routine in the Japanese game Go (my best game). The basic strength unit is one stone, and a one-stone difference represents a full level of difference in strength.\nI (about a 1500 player) once asked a 2100 player how much of a handicap she would need to give me so that we would have an equal chance to win. \&quot;Probably a knight, maybe more,\&quot; she answered. I once took a knight handicap against a 2200 player and lost, but it was a much tighter, closer game than one with no handicap.\nThat might suggest that a pawn is equivalent to about 200 points of rating. Apparently handicapping doesn't do much for say, a 50 point difference in strength (you just play and take your chances). But above that, there might be ways to use handicaps. Even giving someone the first move two times out of three (as was earlier done in professional Go) might do something.\nOr would it? Why hasn't handicapping been done much formally in chess, as in Go?\n\nA: For my niece and nephew (ages 5 and 7), I started spotting them four pieces of their choice ( minus K or Q) and each time they win the number decreases by one. We started by switching sides when things were going my way.\n\nA: I have been handicapping student games for over 15 years, and my two favourites, if the relative strengths allow, are these:\n1)  White replaces queen with rook (about 4 points) -OR-\n2)  White replaces queen with bishop (about 6 points).\nBlack, the handicap receiver, does not have a numerical advantage in pieces.  Both handicaps are strictly worse than the standard even strength situation.  The players do not need to know how to use chess clocks.  Extremely easy to explain.  Handicapping the queen will always impact the game, unlike for example removing a rook.  Doesn't mess up many of the openings as much as removing a knight.  \nAnother handicap that is popular with the kids, and even easier to implement now that many sets come with extra queens, is to power up the weaker player by replacing a piece with the spare queen--usually the QR or the KB.  This one is also nice when giving a simultaneous, because you don't need a stock of spare rooks and bishops.\nUltimately, every chess coach has to ask himself or herself whether handicapping will benefit the club and the students.  A large club with many students at each level may not need to.  My school clubs have not had this luxury; regularly handicapping the stronger players does increase the staying power of the weaker players, and I haven't faced much protest from the stronger players either.\nAnyone else using a system similar to mine out there?\n\nA: Handicapping changes chess in a fundamental way that stones in go do not.  \nIn go, getting an extra stone is roughly equivalent to having an extra move.  In chess, losing a piece is catastrophic, and in a game between two players that are within ~300 rating points, losing a piece means loss of the game.  \nOne other reason that handicapping is not done this way is that while you (1500 player) might lose to a 2200 player (barely) without a knight, it is highly unlikely that a 2000 player would lose to a 2700 player at a tournament time control.  \nHandicapping was done before rating systems became so prevalent.  In clubs, players would be said to be \&quot;knight players\&quot; meaning that they needed odds of a knight in order to give a stronger opponent a good game.  Similarly there were \&quot;pawn\&quot; players and \&quot;rook\&quot; players.\nAn easier handicap between two roughly equal opponents would be to give the weaker player white.  This is roughly equal to 25-40 rating points [1].  Another common handicap is for the stronger player to play \&quot;blindfolded\&quot;, meaning that he or she cannot look at the board, but has to call out the moves in order to play.\n\nA: For \&quot;fun\&quot; games with players of different strengths you can use a chess clock and give the weaker player more time. This allows me to play against my son who is just learning a reasonable chance at winning. We often play where he gets 5 minutes on the clock to my 2 minutes.\n\nA: While giving an opponent the odds of a pawn or a knight might be fun to make the winning chances more distributed, it is by no means an exact method. I remember the exciting handicap match between Kasparov and Chapman. Kasparov won 2.5:1.5 by giving the odds of 2 pawns against an opponent of approx. 450 Elo points less. Since the 2 pawns given changed for each game, not all games were equally difficult for Kasparov. During an interview the former world champion said he feared the game most where he had to let go of the king's center pawn. So a pawn is not a pawn. And if I remember correctly he added that a two pawn disadvantage was much more than double a one pawn disadvantage.\nHence I believe you can't construct a meaningful metric system of which handicap is worth how many points.\n\nQ: Is there a way to use handicaps in chess to bridge the gap between players of different skill levels?

Even giving someone the first move two times out of three (as was earlier done in professional Go) might do something.\nOr would it? Why hasn't handicapping been done much formally in chess, as in Go?\n\nA: Usually, handicaps in Go are used between a weaker and a stronger opponent to make the game more competitive, giving the weaker player more opportunities to attack and defend as would happen in an even game. This is done in turn to avoid the game from becoming a sweep by the stronger player, with the weaker player constantly fumbling defenses. The true underlying purpose of handicapping should be seen as accelerating the learning of the weaker player as opposed to making the game more enjoyable for the weaker player. If the latter is what the player wants, he should seek play with players of equal ability.\nAs described in Andrew's answer, unfortunately, there is no clear way to handicap a game of chess as there is in go. However, if the goal is to use handicapping as a means to accelerate learning chess between a tutor and a student, a common thing to do is to play a normal game of chess, and upon encountering a situation where the weaker player thinks he has a losing position a switch of sides is done upon request of the weaker player: the weaker player becomes the attacker, the stronger player becomes the defender. \nFrom personal experience, a stronger player is a better chess player not because they have some magic ability, but because they see more possibilities and understand the variations better. In this sense, the stronger player is usually able to recover the weaker player's poor position (especially given the rating discrepancy between attacker and defender) making this a very instructive and hands on learning process. As a side effect, the weaker player is given the chance to practice executing attacks correctly.\nObviously for this to work, both parties must agree that winning and losing doesn't mean much, and it is simply play for the enjoyment of the game and to accelerate the weaker player's understanding.\n\nA: In some ways, the rating system is the handicap.  It's very similar to the odds given to less impressive horses in racing, or the less favored boxer.\nIf you over-perform based upon you and your opponents respective ratings, you'll have a net gain of points, even if you don't win many (any?) games.\nI drew a master once and sheared him of many points.  When he beat me at another match, he got like 1 or 2 points because according to the his rating it was expected.\nedit, for the comment:\nNo, I understand the OP completely. The opponents one is paired with are based upon rating. When one's rating drops (or rises), one is paired with players in a similar skill level range. So the \&quot;handicap\&quot; is not having to play brutally better players as often.  There isn't a practical way to handicap individual games in chess like there is in Shogi.\nAt low skill levels, players drop pieces so any sort of handicap would be pointless. Even at my cruddy level, a single pawn adds 200 or 300 rating points, and a piece would add 500 or more. There simply isn't a lot of granularity in chess handicaps.\n\nA: I play against kids at my high school, and they're terrible. I can handicap a queen and both rooks, but usually I still win. When you're playing against low-skill players, handicaps don't matter much.\n\nA: Like some people have mentioned in the thread, both time and piece handicaps are popular in chess.  You also can do \&quot;wager\&quot; handicaps if you're playing for cash or play-money currency.  \nThere are several chess websites that now offer handicapping to help bridge the often vast skill-level differences in chess.  Out of all of them I recommend:\nhttp://www.velocitychess.com\nThis site allows ANY combination of piece, cash, and wager handicap.  For example, as a USCF master, I may offer a weaker player an extra starting knight, his 5 minutes to my 1 minute, and 3:1 wager odds in his favor for a game.  It is a lot of fun!  \n\nQ: Is there a way to use handicaps in chess to bridge the gap between players of different skill levels? Handicapping is routine in the Japanese game Go (my best game).

Playing while down a queen isn't about how well you can play chess, it's about how well you can predict your opponent's moves. Good chess is about making moves that are good no matter what your opponent does, not about correctly guessing what blunder your opponent will make. This is similar to how in games in general, there's only so much that a handicap can make up for bad AI.\nSomething that changes the game less is to give one player more time, but the problem with that is that there's a limit to how much advantage that gives: at some point, the weaker is taking so much time that the stronger player is simply using the weaker player's move to think. If the stronger player can think through two half-moves in less time that it takes the weaker player to think through one half-move, then giving the weaker player more time just helps the stronger player. This effect can be reduced by having two or more weaker players play the stronger player simultaneously. Playing blindfolded can also be a handicap, but how much this hurts a player varies.\nAnother variant, that is similar to ldog's suggestion:\nThe weaker may, when making a move, call out a positive integer. If they have not done so before, it is optional, but once they call out a number, all further moves must be accompanied by a positive integer less than the previous one. If this is not possible (i.e., the previous number was 1), and the move is not checkmate, they lose. \nUntil the stronger player calls out a number, the weaker can switch sides/colors freely. Once the stronger calls out a number, the weaker player can switch sides at any time, but this switch is permanent, and the weaker player now has that many turns to deliver checkmate. \n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/4\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;30\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Skills required for blitz/bullet vs. correspondence chess? I've started playing blitz/bullet (fast) games and felt like I was getting moderately good at it (1 - 10mn games), but then I switched to correspondence chess (1 - 5 days/move) and it seems to me that it was affecting my fast games skills.\nDoes correspondence chess really require a different set of skills than fast chess? Do you have any advice that may help getting the best of both type of games?\n\nA: It really depends more on your personal level of strength for how play proceeds during each of these types of chess, however in general the same strengths and ideas are applicable to both. The difference in your blitz strength and correspondence strength can be for a number of different reasons. Perhaps you can assess and analyze quickly, or you don't spend as much time as your opponent analyzing during correspondence.\nThe time control does not dictate whether it will be a \&quot;strategical\&quot; or \&quot;tactical\&quot; battle, but instead the choice of openings and player's styles.\n\nA: While the two are vastly different, if you improve at one, you will most likely also improve at the other.\nTactics are far more important to get right in correspondence chess.  The slightest misstep will be punished by your opponent simply because they have all the time they need to analyze all of the variations, and they can also use at least a board to assist them, and in some cases, even a chess engine.  \nIn blitz chess, while attacks frequently win the game, unsound moves are not always refuted.  This means that if you are able to launch an attack, even at the cost of a piece, your opponent will most likely be forced to burn time in order to avoid mate, and this will give you an advantage on the clock.  \nIn terms of long term planning, in correspondence chess, assuming a high level game where tactical blunders will not determine the result, plans become incredibly important.  A correspondence game is frequently a battle between two plans while in blitz chess, tactics and the clock rule the day.\nSo overall, correspondence chess is a much higher quality game.  Blitz chess is fun and quick (so you can play a lot more games), but in terms of getting better at chess, blitz won't really help you.  If you want to improve at blitz, practice tactics and play more blitz!\n\nA: This skills required for blitz are the opposite of those for correspondence. So I suggest that you concentrate on one or the other, but not both. Unless you're an insanely good mental juggler.\n\&quot;Blitz\&quot; places a premium on tactical skills. Also, seeing things faster than your opponent.\n\&quot;Correspondence\&quot; places a premium on strategical skills. Looking many moves ahead, and seeing deeper than your opponent. Because you can both play through the various permutations from a given position at home. \n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/5\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;15\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: With only the King left, how can you get a draw? Let's say I have only the King left.\nI've read several rules and posts of people saying there is a limit to the number of moves your opponent has to check mate you in, but there are some inconsistencies:\n\n\n*I found the number of moves varying depending on where I found the info. It seems to be 50, but I am not 100% sure.\n\n*It seems there are some exceptions and cases where the count is reset, but the information seems quite spread all over.\n\nI'd like to understand this rule in detail and know all the special cases if possible, as it seems way too fuzzy for me and the people I play with.\n\nA: By the \&quot;rules\&quot; of chess, 50 moves without captures or pawn moves will result in a draw. When the ONLY pieces left on the board are two kings, a draw occurs. You can also ask the other player for a draw (\&quot;I offer a draw\&quot;).  Threefold repetition of a position will also result in a draw. \n\nA: There is no rule about a number of moves that applies only when one side has a king. So the real answer to your question is, there's no such thing.\nHowever, there is a rule that states that if 50 or more moves (full moves, so 50 by white and 50 by black) have happened without a pawn move or capture, the player to move may claim a draw. It's not necessary that one of the sides has a lone king for that.\n\nA: If a player has a theoretical win, that person has a move limit (50 moves) with \&quot;no fundamental alteration of the position.\&quot; That means no captures of pawns or pieces, and no pawn moves. The count is reset if either of these things happens.\nThere used to be an  exception for positions like king, bishop, and knight vs. King (a checkmate). It was known to be winnable in a maximum of 34 moves. But players got twice this maximum, or 68 moves (Milton Hanauer, \&quot;Chess Made Simple\&quot;). Apparently, this, and other exceptions, were removed later, according to a comment below.\n\nA: \nFor the most part, a draw occurs when it appears that neither side will win.\nDraws are codified by various rules of chess including stalemate\n  (when the player to move has no legal move and is not in check),\n  threefold repetition (when the same position occurs three times with\n  the same player to move), and the fifty-move rule (when the last fifty\n  successive moves made by both players contain no capture or pawn\n  move). \nA draw also occurs when neither player has sufficient material\n  to checkmate the opponent or when no sequence of legal moves can lead\n  to checkmate.\n      Unless specific tournament rules forbid it, players may agree to a draw at any time. \nEthical considerations may make a draw uncustomary\n  in situations where at least one player has a reasonable chance of\n  winning. \nFor example, a draw could be called after a move or two, but\n  this would likely be thought unsporting.\n\nSource\n\nA: I know you mainly asked about the 50 move rule, and that has already been answered, but I thought I'd answer the exact question as stated which was \&quot;With the King as the last piece, how can you get a draw?\&quot;\n\n\n*\n\n*Both players can agree to a draw\n\n*Opponent Stalemates you (you have no legal moves, but are not in check)\n\n*You stalemate your opponent (yes you can do this with just a king, but he has to help you by blocking himself with a pawn for example)\n\n*Your opponent does not have mating material (no pawns and one, Knight or Bishop, or less)\n\n*50-move rule.

Nc3, and went on to win. I've never seen another game that did not open with a pawn. Does a knight opening have any inherent weaknesses? Was it ever popular?\n\nA: 1. Nc3 is not a bad move. It is not a \&quot;favorite\&quot; move because it doesn't open up lines for a queen and bishop like 1. d4 or 1. e4. But you haven't ruled out these possibilities or otherwise wasted a moved.\n1. Nf3 is preferred to 1. Nc3. One, because you've moved your knight for early king side castling, and 2) because it deters Black ...e5 (...d5 would be protected by the queen). But 1. Nc3 does support a later e4.\nThe advantage of 1. Nc3 is that it is a \&quot;quiet\&quot; move that allows you to \&quot;transpose\&quot; into other openings, such as the King's Indian Attack or the Vienna Game. But you retain the option, for a move or two, of WHICH of these other openings. It looks \&quot;harmless\&quot; but isn't. If Black disregards it, he could be in for a nasty surprise. \n\nA: At the highest level of play, grandmasters such as Kramnik essay 1. Nf3 on a frequent basis, and there are complete systems built around it. It also takes care of nuances such as allowing them to sidestep undesirable or unfavourable lines/openings that arise out of normal d4 systems, like the Nimzo-Indian or specific lines in the QGD/KID, or even the English opening.\nNote that although it is technically known as the Reti Opening, it is seldom played for the purpose of getting into one, but for the transposition possibilities as mentioned above.\n\nA: The King's Indian Attack can also be played starting with 1. Nf3 and is widely played among amateurs and pros.\n\nA: Just to add to what James and Soufiane have already added, and to specifically hit on your question about knight openings having weaknesses: this particular knight opening has the weakness of allowing Black control of the center. Nf3 does not have that same weakness.\n\nA: Knight openings are common for my opponents. I've found that knight openings can result in quite strong formations later in the game. So among more casual games, knight openings are semi-common and have some advantages. \n\nA: As some have already said, the move 1. Nc3 has the drawback ot blocking the c-pawn, which is often pushed in closed games.\nAlso, Black has the very concrete move 1... d5 that threatens 2... d4 and asks a serious question to White:\n\n\n*should I prevent ...d4 by playing 2. d4 myself ? This is possible, but in this case why not playing 1. d4  2. Nc3 that is probably more flexible\n\n*Or do I accept or even provoke 2... d4, trying to counter-attack on Black's big pawn center later on ? The game can typically continue with 1. Nc3 d5 2. e4 d4 3. Nce2 etc\n\nIn this opening Black has the upper hand in the center:\n\nAnd usually White tries to attack on the Kingside with plans like Nh4 followed by f4.\n\nI discuss this opening and other ones as well in the following video, if you are interested to know more: https://youtu.be/A-0EiR8b0Gk\n\nA: While not 1. Nc3, the Reti Opening (1. Nf3) is still today one of the most popular openings for white. It has frequent play at amateur and master levels and scores well for both.\nThe opening 1. Nc3 is called the Dunst Opening and is seen much less often. There's a good breakdown of thoughts on the Reti and the Dunst openings over at Wikipedia.\n\nA: The opening starting with 1. Nb1-c3 (long algebraic notation) or 1. Nc3 (short algebraic notation) is called \&quot;Van Geet Opening\&quot;. It is in fact very rare to see this opening being played by either professional players or by amateurs who study the game seriously. White's c pawn gets blocked by the knight with this move, and this might be the reason why pros don't use it very often.\nOn the other hand, Mikhail Chigorin (1850-1908), a strong Russian player from the 1800's played a similar move with the black pieces: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 and the opening got his name (Chigorin's Defense).\nSome opening manuals feature a few paragraphs on these openings (Van Geet Opening and Chigorin Defense) like, for example, FCO (Fundamental Chess Openings by Paul Van der Sterren), Chess Opening Essentials Vol. 2 and Vol. 4, among many others.\n\nQ: Opening with knight I recently came across a game purportedly played by Napoleon (white) where he opened with 1. Nc3, and went on to win. I've never seen another game that did not open with a pawn. Does a knight opening have any inherent weaknesses? Was it ever popular?\n\nA: 1. Nc3 is not often seen because it blocks the c pawn.  In many openings, white wants to push the c pawn to either c3 or c4 in order to help control the center.  With the knight already on c3, this will take an extra two tempi.  \n1. Nf3, the Reti, is more common because pushing the f pawn weakens the king's position.  Therefore, f3 and f4 are fairly rare, and it is a safe bet that the f pawn won't be moved until later in the game when the knight may well have moved from f3.  Furthermore, with 1. Nf3 white keeps his or her options open - white may play either d4, e4, or c4 at the appropriate moment.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/9\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;19\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What is the best way to free your queen as soon as possible? We can open games in many ways (any of the pawns or knights) and then go ahead with different strategies. The queen being the most important piece, I would like to get it out in the field without compromising the security of the king and using a minimum number of moves. Which types of opening and/or moves would facilitate this? Also provide any pros and cons to your strategy.\n\nA: Bringing out the queen in the opening is in general not the correct decision. The point is that usually the other side will often be able to develop their pieces to attack the queen and gain tempi.\nHowever, if you still feel inclined to bring out the queen early, the only opening with a sound reputation I can recommend is the Scandinavian (1. e4 d5) as black, and after the usual 2. exd5 Qxd5 your queen is out. Be prepared for Nc3 and other moves that attack your queen, gaining your opponent a tempo, and allowing him to develop quickly. \n\nA: If you play Black, Qxd5 Variation of the Scandinavian Defence is something that comes to mind...\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 d5 \n2. exd5 Qxd5\n\n\nA: One common opening playable against most mere mortals is the Scandanivian:  \n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5\n\nThis brings the queen out early, but white often plays his bishop to d2 and later attacks the queen here (often by moving a later knight placed on Nc3, giving a discovered attack).\nRegardless, this opening is playable in spite of the early queen sortie, not because of it.  It's often used as an example of what not to do, but in this case isn't completely illogical.\n\nA: The best way I can think of \&quot;free\&quot; my queen is to play an opening in which two or three pairs of minor pieces or pawns were quickly exchanged. \nThere is a danger of a queen being trapped on a \&quot;cluttered\&quot; board, and being forced to exchange herself for one or two minor pieces. Once a few of these are gone, the queen has a much freer scope over the board, in combination with rooks (occasionally with one of the remaining bishops).\n\nA: Generally speaking, the queen likes open lines and lots of manoevering space, because she has long-range attack capabilities and being far away can't be targeted as easily by minor pieces. So if you enjoy playing the queen early despite all the dangers involved you should prefer openings that open lines quickly. Inbalanced positions with play on both sides of the board are preferable. Since the queen is an excellent attacking piece, look for gambits, too, because they usually aim at opening lines and sacrify material for speed of development, which is a must for a happy queen, since she usually needs support from at least another piece to work best. At example, look at the king's gambit or Latvian gambit.\n\nA: As others pointed out bringing the queen into play early is a double edged sword. That said, there are several main lines doing this. \nScandinavian was already mentioned. Then we have one Ponziani main line (although often the arguably weaker 3... Nf6 is played): \n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 d5 (3... Nf6) 4. Qa4\n\nIf you like to play aggressive, the Steinitz variation in the Scotch might be for you: \n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Qh4 \n\nHowever be aware that you have a hard time if white doesn't cling to the pawn but attacks your weak spot c7 with the knight.\nThere are plenty of other choices (e.g. the Middle Gambit).\n\nA: The right answer is \&quot;don't do it,\&quot; but the straight answer – which might be less helpful – is that\n1 e4 e5\n2 Qh5\n\nis the best way for White to get the Queen out early, if White is really determined to do so. It's goofy but at least forcing. Best play continues\n2 ... Nc6\n3 Bc4 g6\n4 Qf3 Nf6\n\nWhite has already squandered the initiative by this point, though; Black now threatens ...Nd4 with a big gain of time.\n5 Ne2 =/=\n\nAnother suggestion is to play the Evans Gambit, where White's Qd1-b3 is often available. But unlike 2. Qh5, that depends on Black's response.\n\nQ: What is the best way to free your queen as soon as possible?

The queen being the most important piece, I would like to get it out in the field without compromising the security of the king and using a minimum number of moves. Which types of opening and/or moves would facilitate this? Also provide any pros and cons to your strategy.\n\nA: It is usually a good idea to NOT bring your queen out early. If you are not careful, you can lose tempo and development because your Queen will be chased around the board as your opponent continues to develop.\n\nA: I don't think that getting your queen out early should be your goal in the opening.  Fighting for the center, developing your pieces, and king safety should be your priority.  That said, e-pawn openings are your best bet to open lines for your queen as soon as possible.

With regard to rooks, bishops and knights, might there be a a different inherent value whether on kingside or queenside? For instance, I've always found a greater value to kingside bishops because of their inherent nature of attacking the opposing king's squares before and after castling.\nHas anyone seen any documented systems based on this idea? I'm not looking for speculation.\n\nA: I don't think that there's any value to where the pieces start, but the value of the pieces changes drastically depending on where they are on the board at a given time.  \nFor example, a white knight on d6 that can't be exchanged off is usually considered to be worth a rook.  Similarly, if black has castled kingside with pawns on f7, g6, and h7, and white has an unopposed dark square bishop, that bishop can be worth a rook (at least) if white can attack the black king.  \nThe only pieces that are inherently different are the bishops (one light, one dark), but they're still equal until the pawn structure has been determined.  A bishop is usually strong when the opponent's pawns are on its color (so they can be attacked) and the friendly pawns are on the opposite color (so they don't get in the way).  \n\nA: To the best of my understanding, in modern chess, the real values of pieces (or rather, the playing side as a whole) are largely dependent on the following factors: function (are they optimally poised to carry out particular goal(s)?), coordination between pieces (are they working together to fulfil multiple aims or getting into one another's way?), number of weaknesses inherent in the position (determined largely by pawn structure), tactics (although this can be explained by the earlier factors), and finally, the raw value of the individual pieces.\nSo the assignment of numeric values to individual pieces is relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things, at least for players who are past the point of giving away pawns or minor pieces for nothing. Those values only serve as a rough gauge (e.g. bishop and knight are comparable in terms of value, but not identical in that regard), among other factors to be considered for the proper assessment of any given position.\n\nA: Pieces don't change value based on whether they are on the queen or kingside. They increase in value (based on placement) for other reasons. \nFor instance, former world champion Capablanca said in \&quot;Chess Fundamentals\&quot; said that getting a rook on the seventh rank was well worth a sacrificed pawn, and his opponent would do well to draw, even with a pawn ahead. In this case, a rook, normally worth five points, is worth at least six. Capablanca also said that a passed pawn was sufficient to win a game (all other things being equal). So a passed pawn might be worth two points instead of one. Likwise, a knight in a \&quot;hole\&quot; at e4, e5, e6, or d4, d3, d6 would be worth more than usual, perhaps four points, rather than three. Most masters would say that a \&quot;bishop pair\&quot; in an open position against a bishop and knight, or two knights is worth least seven points, not six.\n\nA: I don't think that there's a system to value pieces based on that.  As you get into the middle and endgame, the position dictates the relative value of the pieces and not the side that they started on.  Do a search on good knight vs. bad bishop.  Also take a look at Silman's books \&quot;How to Reassess your Chess\&quot; which discusses imbalances as a way of evaluating a position instead of a pure material assessment.\n\nA: Other than the classical 9,5,3,3,1 valuation of the pieces, there are many more, as in this Wikipedia article.  But these still don't vary with the position of these pieces at the start or in later stages of the game.  However, most any computer chess engine will vary these values according to the position of the pieces.  \nEven outside of computer chess, it's not unheard of for some to suggest that and a or h pawn is worth as little as 75% or even 50% of a pawn on the d or e files, and so on.  For example, one chess maxim says you should usually recapture with a pawn -towards the center-.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/25\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;10\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Is there any free software to automatically analyze and annotate games?

At the link you can DL the interface and a compatible engine of relatively strong strength. It provides a decent enough opening database, and will give you computer evaluations for each move. \n\nA: Most chess programs allow you to run an engine while you go through the moves of a game, and see the engine's evaluations.  This is sometimes called a Kibitzer, Infinite Analysis or just Analyze.  The program Chessbase and Tarrasch are examples of programs which do this.\nSome programs can be set up to annotate, blundercheck or do a full game analysis.  In this, you set how long the engine will look at each move, and what degree of error it should comment on.  When it finishes its analysis, it shows you game notation marked with question marks and alternate lines.  The programs that do this are Aquarium, Arena, Babaschess, Chess Assistant, the engine GUIs sold by the company Chessbase (Fritz, Hiarcs, Houdini, Komodo, Rybka, Shredder), Chessmaster, Chesspartner, Hiarcs Chess Explorer, SCID, SCID vs PC and the Shredder GUI sold by shredderchess.com.

In the middle and the end of a chess game, there are visible consequences to almost every move you can make, there are more constraints limiting what is logical to move, and it is fairly straightforward to see what you did wrong when you analyze the game.\nAt the beginning of the game, it seems like there is a tremendous number of possible ways a game could progress--and not very many of the moves have any immediately tangible consequences. Because of this, I usually have no idea what I should do in the beginning of a game.\nAre there any things I should be thinking about at the beginning? Up to date, I've just been moving pieces haphazardly until what I need to do becomes obvious.\n\nA: Agree with @JaredDef's answer which covers the big ideas. Some more specific opening strategies for beginners can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*make your first move with the\npawn in front of either your King or Queen \n\n*make good developing moves, and generally develop your\nKnights before your Bishops \n\n*try not to move the same piece twice in the opening \n\n*your King's safety is crucial; castle early if you can\n\n*don't advance more than one or two pawns in the chess opening, and definitely not a pawns in front of your castled King\n\n*when you develop your pieces, try to make moves which threaten something\n\n*don't bring your Queen out early\n\n\nA: Memorize three openings to several moves.  I recommend, as white, one opening, probably king-pawn opening.  Then memorize two openings as black so you can react your opponent's K- or Q- pawn openings.\nFor example, I prefer a King's Indian Defense to 1. d4, and the Caro-Kann Defence to 1. e4.\nWhen playing white, I play a Queen's Gambit.\nMemorize the most popular lines to 5 or 6 moves.  Then study them to find out why those moves are popular.\nAnd to answer your question directly, you should be looking to take material or kill the guy's king, starting on move 1 (paraphrased from Bobby Fischer.)  Good piece development is a great start.\n\nA: According to world champion Capablanca, in \&quot;Chess Fundamentals,\&quot; your first priority is to get your pieces out as fast as you can. If White, you might take a detour to try to hinder black's development, in order to maintain your relative advantage; if Black, you need to find tactical ways to parry White's threats.\nOtherwise, you should be looking to concentrate your pieces, particularly in areas left weak by your opponent. Did s/he leave parts of the board undeveloped or undefended to favor a few pieces? Then try to find a way to take advantage of that fact. Perhaps the opposing king is inadequately protected, and can be attacked. If not, your opponent may have started an a attack prematurely and left the so-called \&quot;center\&quot; (of the board) insufficiently guarded. If so, a successful center counterattack will stop most attacks. \n\nA: \n\n*Develop your pieces, not Pawns\n\n*Try not to move the same piece more than once in an opening unless\n\n*you really need to. Gain control of the center Castle your king\n\n*Develop/Connect your rooks Don't move too fast or you will blunder.\n\n*Take your time and view the whole board.\n\n\nA: There are a few regular things you should fight for out of the opening\n\n\n*Control of the center\n\n*Development of pieces\n\n*Early castle\n\n*Space\n\nSo basically you want to get as many pieces out as quickly as possible, while attempting to control the center (the four middle squares and to a lesser extent the next ring of 12 squares). While not all opening strategies revolve strictly around these principles, it is found in the majority of games and especially good rules to play by when starting out.\nEDIT: Keep in mind these are not all rigid rules. I would also like to respectfully disagree with Tony. When starting out, memorizing openings is the very last thing you want to do. Feel free to look through an openings book (The first, and very amazing, book on openings that I read) or database. However do not seek just to memorize and spit out moves until you reach a position you haven't actually thought about.\n\nA: Say \&quot;no\&quot; to memorizing openings. Say \&quot;yes\&quot; to playing based on opening principles. Say \&quot;yes\&quot; to trial-by-fire - you learn more. Every game is an opportunity to learn something. If you get rolled in the opening, find out how you can improve your play in that line and learn it - don't memorize variations just for the sake of it. Waste of time at levels of chess below Cat A, IMHO.\nYou can find a list of basic opening principles freely on the net. Or, go to Chess.com and take some of the free beginner courses. Right up your alley.\n\nQ: What strategies should I be thinking about at the beginning of the game?

Sometimes I end up getting the opportunity to play a friendly game with someone who has played a lot more chess than I have; these games seem more fun and interesting for everyone (and I seem to end up with a better chance of winning) when I can push play away from common positions without incurring a big early disadvantage. Are there openings that I can study to accomplish that more dependably?\n\nA: Gambits are often a good way to get your opponent out of their comfort zone.  As white, some good gambits include:\n\n\n*the Morra Gambit\n\n*the Evans Gambit\n\n*4. Ng5 in the Two Knight's Defense (black is sacrificing a pawn here though!)\n\nFor black, the Sicilian and the King's Indian are good ways to create a double edged game.  A line that you know by heart in the Sicilian is probably your best bet.  Against d4 you can consider playing an early ...c5 with the Benko Gambit or the Benoni - both of which can lead to an unbalanced game as well.  White probably has a fairly good idea of what to do against the KID because it is so common which is why either the Benko or the Benoni can be a nice change of pace.\n\nA: You should focus on openings that require thematic or strategic understanding, as opposed to ones that require lots of book-knowledge/theory. Then you will get to positions that you are comfortable in and not have to learn the nuances of sharp and highly-analzyed variations that more experienced players will tend to thrive in.  Basically, an experienced player's \&quot;comfort zone\&quot; is beating a less-experienced player in a theoretical line: they have a risk free way of leaving the opening with an advantage. If you take away that theoretical advantage, I would argue they will be less comfortable facing you.\nIM Andrew Martin discusses opening repertoires here. Based on the above, from his list of opening repertoires I would then suggest:\n\nFor White: Trompowski and Pseudo-Trompowski\n1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5! And 1 d4 d5 2 Bg5! A must here will be to get hold of as many Julian Hodgson games as possible- he has been carving up Patzer and Grandmaster alike for many, many years. At the heart of this repertoire is the limitation of Black's choices- you are conducting the game on your terms. The positions can be different too- White can opt for Pawn structure play or outright attack depending on how he is feeling.\nFor Black: Scandinavian and Slav set-ups\nRock solid. As Black vs 1 e4 play the main line BANKER with 1...d5 2 exd5 Qxd5 3 Nc3 Qd8! or 3...Qa5, in both cases following with ...Nf6, ...c6 and ...Bf5! And vs d4 and Flank Openings go for the solid Slav set up with ...c6 and ..d5, aiming for a similar structure. Truly an opening which can be learned in a minimum of time .\n\n\nA: The Benko gambit is good if you're playing black.\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. d4 Nf6\n2. c4 c5\n3. d5 b5\n\n\nA: GM Edmar Mednis wrote an excellent book on How to Defeat a Superior Opponent, in which he states that you should not attempt to play to your opponent's weaknesses, but instead play to your strengths.\nThis means that you should:\n\n\n*Know what playing style suits you\n\n*Pick a few openings that lead to games of that kind\n\n*Learn the main ideas of those openings, and some key variations (and any traps)\n\nThen he adds:\n\n\n*Find opportunities to create complexity in the position, so that your opponent has a higher chance of making a mistake\n\nThere are a few off-the-beaten path openings that will force him out of his book, but they will only give you an advantage if you are also comfortable in the positions to which those openings lead.

Sometimes I end up getting the opportunity to play a friendly game with someone who has played a lot more chess than I have; these games seem more fun and interesting for everyone (and I seem to end up with a better chance of winning) when I can push play away from common positions without incurring a big early disadvantage. Are there openings that I can study to accomplish that more dependably?\n\nA: You should play the positions that you play the most and are most comfortable in. Since it is unlikely that those same openings are also the most common for your opponent, you will be relatively more comfortable in them than he is.\nThe problem with playing a special opening just against experienced players is that you will be just as uncomfortable playing them as they are. That is, unless the experienced player happens to know it, then it's actually only uncomfortable for you...\n\nA: The Alekhine's Defence as black. It's a great practical, attacking weapon:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 Nf6\n2. e5 Nd5\n3. d4 d6\n\n\nA: You can play a surprising opening, which your more experienced opponent has probably encountered very rarely, like a gambit or a rare sideline. Theoretically-wise you will stand on more even ground then. Even better, since you will play this line often, you will have more practice with it than him, improving the odds even more. But usually such openings are seldom played for a reason, at example because they are unsound, or you have to remember very complicated lines, or they offer less winning chances than competing opening systems. There are so many such opening systems (there are even periodicals dealing exclusively with them) I don't list any of them over others.\nApart from this general thought I would suggest a more detailed approach. Try to understand what the exact nature of the advantages of your opponent (or what your own disadvantages) are and act accordingly:\n\n\n*Tactically much better than you?  => go for quiet lines with focus on strategic plans,\nuse closed systems with few tactics so you deny him the use of his\nadvantage\n\n*Much better theoretical opening knowledge? => use sidelines\nand shaky gambits, and pray he doesn't know those ugly refutations\nand critical lines\n\n*Strategically much better? => choose simple\nsystems and learn the ideas behind them thoroughly. You will close the\ngap soon and know the resulting structures as good as he.\n\n*Generally better in every aspect? => play what you like\nmost and learn from your defeats\n\nA word of warning, though. For a competing mind this might sound like a clever plan. True, it is fun to spring a surprise weapon at a stronger opponent and gain a victory this way. But, and this is a big BUT, in the long run your goal is probably to become a better player over time, and this means gaining a deeper understanding of all the chess topics. Remember you can't get better at tactics by avoiding them ;) When your opponent leaves his comfort zone, he may play weaker. But leaving your own comfort zone makes you stronger - in the long run!\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/56\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;17\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Is it possible to force checkmate with King, Knight, and Bishop vs. King? If a King, Knight, and Bishop are pitted against the opposing King, is it possible to force checkmate? I find it very hard to do, enough so that I'm not sure whether there's a clean method.\n\nA: [Edited] The winning plan is to force the king into either of the corners which have the same colour as your bishop. \nThis is done in a few steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Force the king to one side of the board so he is stuck on either the a/h file or 1st/8th rank\n\n*Use the W manoeuvre to force the king to the corner of your bishop, then use the motif of knight check on (e.g. Na3+ to hit b1) then mate with your king on b3, knight covering b1 and Bishop mates on the long diagonal (e.g. Bg7#).  \n\n\nI have put a detailed review of each step of the ending on my website.\n\nA: Yes it is. Check out this video!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3EqM17jvOc\nThe general rule is to get the opponent king in the same corner as your bishop. Use the knight and king to control the squares of opposite color to the color your bishop controls. Then, drive the opponent king to one of the two corners with the correct color!\n\nA: Yes, mate can be forced in 33 moves from nearly any position, according to Wikipedia.\nSee the standard \&quot;w\&quot; maneuver cited in that article.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to force mate.  There's a phenomenal video explaining the process on chessvideos.tv.\nIf you want to practice the endgame, you can do so on the same site as well.\n\nA: Yes, it can be done. The standard position is to force the enemy king into a corner of the same color as the bishop. Then there are four squares (the corner, the diagonal, and two lateral) squares that need to be attacked.\nThe bishop attacks the corner and diagonal squares, the king guards one of the lateral squares, and the knight the other one.\n[FEN \&quot;8/5N2/8/5K2/8/5Bk1/8/8 w - - 0 1\&quot;]\n[White \&quot;K + B + N vs K\&quot;]\n[Black \&quot;White to play and win\&quot;]\n[Result \&quot;1-0\&quot;]\n\n1.

But, if you try to do it own your own, it will help you with learning how to make better use of minor pieces in the end game.\nIf you can confine the king to a corner of the same colour as the bishop, then it is over (try it!).\nThe method most people know is composed of two parts: (i) confine his king to some corner, and (ii) force it to a corner of correct colour (colour of your bishop). Part (ii) is is called the W technique in the lore. Part (i) is easy; part (ii) is not. I recommend against memorizing part (ii).\nBut being able to do part (i) is a must. Practice it if you cannot do it. If you are good at it, in some positions, you will be able to directly confine the opponent king to a 'right' corner - something that memorizing people cannot. Once you can do part (i) easily, may be just see the 'W technique' more to enjoy than to memorize. It is basically repeatedly forcing the king to move one square closer to the right corner (you fix that corner this time). This is done with a knight maneuver basically. You can then try to do it on your own. Whether you can recreate it or not doesn't matter.\n(Note: if you are doing it on your own, it may go beyond the allowed 50 moves and lead to a draw. Don't worry about that. Once you can do it on your own, practice that ending with a friend and try to achieve that mate quicker. )\n\nQ: Is it possible to force checkmate with King, Knight, and Bishop vs. King? If a King, Knight, and Bishop are pitted against the opposing King, is it possible to force checkmate? I find it very hard to do, enough so that I'm not sure whether there's a clean method.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, and any basic chess manual will demonstrate the method.  As mentioned above, the king must be driven into a corner the color of your bishop.  To those who say it occurs too rarely to bother to learn, I might mention that I was able to steer a rated game into such an ending, knowing that with my understanding of how to do it I could force mate, which I was able to do well within the allotted 50 moves.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/59\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;36\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Which chess website has the strongest players? The debate on which is the \&quot;best\&quot; chess website tends to be subjective and thus is inconclusive. On the other hand, the site that has the strongest players should be objectively ascertainable provided metrics are available.\nSo which is the strongest chess website in terms of:\n\n\n*Number of registered titled players (FM, WFM, IM, WIM, GM, WGM)\n\n*Number of active (routinely visit) titled players \n\n*Number of super-GMs (> 2800)\n\n*Or other verifiable metrics.\n\n\nA: As of 2020 I believe by far the most popular sites to play online chess are lichess, chess.com and chess24.\nI am not aware of any publicly available statistics on the metrics you suggest. From what I see many of the top players are active on several sites. \nThe commercial websites chess24 and chess.com are likely paying some of the titled players giving them an advantage. Still, even Magnus Carlsen is seen regularly on lichess as well.\nOn the other hand, what should count most would be, how likely is it that you play a game against a titled player. If that is your aim, the total number of titled players is fairly irrelevant and you'd better look at what tournaments/shows/... the websites offer in this respect.\nBanter blitz sessions are one way, but there are also tournaments (particularly those with minimum rating requirements) that are a good way to find titled players.\n\nA: chess.com is definitely one of the contenders. If you're a member, you'd know that GM Carlsen, GM Caruana, GM Nakamura; to name a few, are quite active there.\n\nA: ICC and playchess.com are definitely the top two in terms of the number of registered titled players who play actively.\nI was able to find metrics on how many titled players are on ICC, seen here; I couldn't find the numbers for playchess, however they are similar.  Many titled players play on both.\n\nA: The question was which site has the strongest players. I presume this means rating to strength ratio. ICC is the leader there in my opinion, you really have to know your chess to get a good rating; it's a proper 'club'.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/71\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;11\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What proofs for refuted gambits are there? I've stumbled upon this article a while ago, and I've also seen refutations for the Muzio Gambit (Joseph Kling &amp; Bernard Horwitz - Chess Studies on Endings of Games). I'm wondering what other gambits are proven to be unsound.\nEdit: I'm looking for refuted gambits in the strict sense of the word, followed by proof. Even though a gambit might be playable against someone who doesn't know its refutation, the gambit is still considered refuted if it is proven that the side who initiated the gambit loses in all variations worth looking at against best play. So yes, I'm looking for scientific proof.\nAlso, if a database of almost all games played in a particular gambit shows that the side that initiated the gambit wins almost all the time, this doesn't mean that there isn't a way for that gambit to be refuted, it just means that if there is a way, most people haven't played it.\nAbove everything, I'm looking for material to learn from. An article that says that Vasik Rajlich or someone else has used a computer cluster and came to a conclusion regarding a certain position, how will I benefit from it if there is no proof? (And please note that that King's-Gambit-busted-by-Rajlich article was in fact a Chessbase April Fools' joke!)\n\nA: A gambit can be proven to be unsound by using a modern chess engine. Having said this, I would like to mention a comic gambit, known as the Fred defense:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 f5 2.exf5 Kf7 3.Qh5+ g6 4.fxg6+ Kg7 5.gxh7 Rxh7 6.Qg4+ Kh8\n\nWhite has picked up 2 pawns. In return, the black king has done an artificial castle and black's pieces are ready to develop and kick the white queen around the board. The next plan for black is to launch an attack on the white king and catch it before it has time to castle. Also, the plan is to firmly grab the center, which will restrict the development of white's pieces. To theoretically refute a gambit is one thing. To refute it while sitting at the board is a totally different game altogether. That is why gambits are so much fun!\n\nA: I believe there are a few gambits completely solved, that is, analyzed up to positions that either the material advantage is enough to guarantee a win or this win is achieved by means of technique (if the final position is not directly checkmate). The only one that I know a proof of, however, is the Latvian Gambit:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5\n\nThe Spanish analyst Alejandro Melchor provides two very insightful .pgn with what he considers to be the refutation of said defense. Here you may download the first one and here you may download the second one. He also wrote an appendix.\nThey both are deep in calculations and very detailed, if you ever want to play perfect chess against this gambit, then good luck. Even if a gambit is \&quot;refuted\&quot;, not many know these lines and the ensuing complications. This makes almost any gambit, refuted or not, completely playable (provided you are not facing a super-GM).\nP.D.: I had to upload the files via a third party, I hopes it's not inconvenient, since I don't know if it's possible to upload files directly via Stackexchange.\n\nA: Here is an article that describes a way to compare (and refute) chess openings.\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2415203\n\nA: As long as chess can't be calculated from beginning to end, it is very hard to scientifically prove an opening to be refuted (aside from lines that leave you with such hopeless situations like a bare king against king and rook, of course).\nIf you are satisfied with a less scientific proof, I'd say gambits are even less so refuted. In my opinion, nearly all gambits are playable, as long as you won't play it against a superhuman database/program or a world champion. In a practical sense, probably no gambit worth of having a name is refuted in the sense of not being playable. Even if a gambit is widely considered unsound and often results in a worse position, it might contain enough steam to give your chess skill ample opportunities to overpower your opponent.I even remember a game where I suffered terrible against the BDG because I didn't find any refutation over the board. I only won because my opponent terribly misplayed the late midgame, but from the opening point of view he should have won the game.\nSo my answer is: No gambit I know of is refuted to the degree of being unplayable.\n\nQ: What proofs for refuted gambits are there? I've stumbled upon this article a while ago, and I've also seen refutations for the Muzio Gambit (Joseph Kling &amp; Bernard Horwitz - Chess Studies on Endings of Games). I'm wondering what other gambits are proven to be unsound.\nEdit: I'm looking for refuted gambits in the strict sense of the word, followed by proof.

(And please note that that King's-Gambit-busted-by-Rajlich article was in fact a Chessbase April Fools' joke!)\n\nA: Many gambits are unsound. The proof is told by the number of these played at the highest levels of the game.  So, if you don't see the Blackmar-Diemer gambit at top tournaments, you can assume that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages.  The King's Gambit is one famously busted opening.\nThat being said, we're not top players. Most of us can't beat the players who can't beat the top players.  I'd wager, charitably, that 75% of the moves we make are wrong, technically.\nIn short, they're probably all playable.  As always, if you're going to take chances, book up first.  Understand the opening, know the main lines.\n\nA: First of all, to refute a gambit, we need to analyse all the lines to a [forced] win. For example, the Latvian Gambit will result in all lines ending with a material advantage for White able to guarantee a win.\nHowever, for the Muzio Gambit, there is no such proof. Black will eventually have to give a knight back to reduce White's initiative, so there is no proof at all.\nEDIT: I ran a bunch of games through Stockfish depth 22 with the Muzio Gambit, and Black eventually loses the knight and the position reaches equality.\n\nA: The Damiano Defense, also known as the five pawns gambit, is practically refuted.

(Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)\n\nA: I don't think anyone has mentioned the Staunton Gambit:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n\n1.d4 f5 2.e4 fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6\n\nwhich I had the opportunity to play successfully against the computer earlier this week when it played the Dutch Defense.  It can be seen as a sounder relative of the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.e4) since 1...f5 does not contribute to Black's development and leaves the black king slightly exposed, which 2.e4 aims to take advantage of. It's sufficient for dynamic equality and can provide White with a very dangerous attack if Black is not adequately prepared for it.\nAnd the From Gambit is a strong, albeit double-edged, response to Bird's opening (1. f4 e5 2. fxe5 [2. e4 transposes to the King's Gambit] d6 3. exd6 Bxd6).  If White is careless, Black can generate some quick Fool's Mate variation kingside mating attacks based on the absence of the f2 pawn and the weakness on the e1-h4 diagonal.\n\nA: It is difficult to force an aggressive position in any opening.  Even in the King's Gambit, Black can simply play 2...d6 or Bc5 to reach a more positional type of position.\nWith that said, some popular openings traditionally thought to be more aggressive include the Sicilian Defence, the Dutch Defence, the Albin Counter-Gambit, the Benko Gambit, the King's Indian Defense, the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, and an array of gambits on 1. e4.\n\nA: Perhaps the most insanely aggressive opening that's remotely playable is the Halloween Gambit,\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n[Title \&quot;Halloween Gambit\&quot;]\n\n1. e4 e5\n2. Nf3 Nc6\n3. Nc3 Nf6\n4.

The White pawns roll up-board, attacking moves come naturally for White, while Black mis-steps can rapidly lead to catastrophe.\nStrangely enough, Black's best idea in practical play may be to calmly counter-sac his own knight and play for a slight but sure positional advantage.\nSee also the Cochrane Gambit, a similar idea, but with a more distinguished pedigree.\n\nQ: What are examples of very aggressive openings?

It is extremely aggressive, and makes for a sharp tactical game without sacrificing too much material.  It isn't played much at the highest level at standard time controls, but even today it is occasionally used in blitz by top level players such as Hikaru Nakamura.\nWhat other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)\n\nA: I recommend to try Grob's Attack. This opening is very agressive for both white and black. And a lot of players don't know to play correctly in this opening as I found.\n[FEN \&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\&quot;]\n1. g4\n\nBlack can answer with Romford Countergambit, for example:\n[FEN \&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\&quot;]\n1. g4 d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 d4 4. Bxb7 Nd7 5. Bxa8 Qxa8 6. f3 d3\n\n\nA: I personally like the Grob opening, especially for blitz.\nIt goes:\n\n*\n\n*g4\n\nAnd, just an example of a continuation:\n.. d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 e6 4. Qb3\nI also like using the same idea as black playing against 1. e4. For example:\n\n*\n\n*e4 g5 2. d4 Bg7 3. Bxg5 3. c5 4. Be3 Qb6\n\nThe computer evaluation isn't always sound, but in practical play (in blitz), it works pretty well.\n\nA: The Caveman variation (Caro-kann advance variation sideline) should do the trick:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. h4 h5 5. Bg5 Qb6 6. Bd3!? Bxd3 7. Qxd3 Qxb2 8. e6!\n\nIf Black takes the free rook, you get a strong attack.\nThe only problem is that you'll have to get your opponent to play THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF MOVES, which is very difficult considering the length of the line.\n\nA: The Open Sicilian (1.e4 c5 followed by 2.Nf3 and 3.d4) counts, in my view. White immediately gets a lead in development and great attacking chances, in return for some positional sacrifice, most notably the 1v2 pawns in the center.\nThis opening is famous for its wild sacrificial attacks, in my opinion even more so than the king's gambit. Piece sacrifices on b5, d5 and e6, and black exchange sacrifices on c3 are the order of the day.\nAnd best of all: almost all top players play it. It's actually good.\n\nA: Sometimes, one way to get overtly aggressive in a reasonably sound way is to throw out an early g4 pawn thrust in an otherwise vanilla, mainline position. For instance, in the Anti-Meran 6.Qc2 variation of the Semi-Slav, the gambit move 7.g4!? was popularized by Shirov and Shabalov:\n[fen \&quot;\&quot;]\n\n1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Qc2 Bd6 7.g4!?\n\nSpeaking of Shirov, he pioneered a similar idea with 5.g4!? against the Pirc move-order of the Philidor Defense, and one could also try it a move earlier:\n[fen \&quot;\&quot;]\n\n1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 (4.g4!?) e5 5.g4!?\n\n\nQ: What are examples of very aggressive openings?

(Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)\n\nA: Indirectly Benoni Defense is one of the best opening for modern chess player. (A66)\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n[Title \&quot;Beoni Defense\&quot;]\n\n1.d4 Nf6\n2.c4 c5\n3.d5 e6\n4.Nc3 exd5\n5.cxd5 d6\n6.e4 g6\n7.f4\n\n\nA: Two interesting gambit trees to be aware of are:\n1) The Scotch/Goring/Italian/Danish gambit complex (there's a lot of opportunity to transpose among them). These start out with:\n1. e4 e5 2. d4 ed 3. c3 (Danish)\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 ed 4. c3 (Goring)\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 ed 4. Bc4 (Scotch)\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d4 (Italian)\n\nThe transpositions among them (and into both the Two Knight's and the Max Lange) should be enough to gratify anyone.\n2) The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. The basic line of this is:\n1. d4 d5 2. e4 de 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3\n\nBut the utility of this gambit lies in the great potential for transposition from semi-open e4 defenses:\n1. e4 d5 2. d4 (from Center Counter)\n1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Be3 de (from French)\n1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3 5. bc de 6. f3 (also French)\n1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 (from Alekhine's)\n1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 de 4. f3 (from Caro-Kann)\n\nYou can basically run any response to e4 except ...e5 and ...c5 and ...d6 into a BDG (and with the Sicilian or Pirc, you might find enough life in the f3 systems to keep you playing some sharp games even then).\n\nA: The Smith-Morra Gambit is aggressive for white.\n[fen \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 (4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2)\n\nWhite has sacrificed a pawn (or two) to free up his development. \n\nA: Let me recommend two sharp opening variations for the black pieces: the Sicilian Najdorf and Semi-Slav Botvinnik variation. They lead to dynamic and complicated positions with chances for both sides. They are excellent for playing for a win with the black pieces. To master one or both of these variations, I recommend getting at least one modern book per variation and study these in great detail. Also, check all grandmaster games you can find and explore the ideas for both sides in these positions.\nThe starting position of the Sicilian Najdorf is reached after\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6\n\nLet's try to understand this position. Black has a statically better position thanks to the semi-open c-file. This means that an exchange of queens in this position is beneficial for black. White will fight for the d5 square and try to plant a light piece there. Black will try to deliver the d6-d5 center blow, thematic for the Sicilian system. White castles queenside in the sharpest Najdorf variations. Black castles kingside, queenside or stays with the King in the center, depending on the situation. Black chooses between the setups e7-e6, e7-e5 and g7-g6. White chooses between f2-f3 and f2-f4.\nWhen white castles queenside, black attacks with the b- and a-pawns as well as the thematic exchange sac Rc8xNc3 bxc3, ruining the queenside pawn structure. If this exchange sac can be followed by picking up the e4-pawn, then it can be done at virtually any moment. Another thematic plan for black is placing a knight on e5 (after white's f-pawn is either on f5 or exchanged off) or c4 (attacking the b2-pawn and undermining the c3-knight).\nThe starting position of the Semi-Slav Botvinnik is reached after\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5\n\nAt first glance, black just grabbed the c4-pawn and is trying to hold on to it for dear life. Yet things are more subtle than this. Black has entered an assymetric position where white has to find dynamic plans to compensate for the material loss. It also looks like white is winning with e4-e5. Yet again, things are not so simple at all. A bit deeper we reach the following position\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 Nbd7 11.exf6\n\nWhite will try to win using the extra kingside pawns. White can also launch an attack on the black King. Black will try to win by launching an attack on the white King, after developing with Bc8-b7, Qd8-b6 and O-O-O. White will most probably castle kingside, since staying in the center or castling queenside looks spooky. Black will open the a8-h1 diagonal and attack the isolated d4-pawn. I have used both these variations with joy and success. They are simply awesome!\n\nQ: What are examples of very aggressive openings? One of my favorite openings is the King's Gambit.

(Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)\n\nA: Sicilian Defense, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack\nAnother pretty sharp opening for both sides is The Sicilian Dragon, with the Yugoslav Attack being one of the sharpest variations. It differs from most of the openings listed here because it's not a gambit, but still a very sharp and dangerous opening with lots of threats for both White and Black.\n9. Bc4  being the more aggressive move and 9. O-O-O  goes for more tactical play.\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n[Title \&quot;Sicilian Defense / Dragon Variation / Yugoslav Attack\&quot;]\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 (9. O-O-O)\n\n\nA: The most (overly-)aggressive openings I know of that aren't too bad would probably be the Danish Gambit (Accepted) and the Fried Liver Attack.\n\nDanish Gambit Accepted:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2 \n\nWhite gets three open files and both bishops on open diagonals facing black's king; black gets two pawns.  Usually considered slightly better for black, but played occasionally even up to master level.\n\nFried Liver Attack:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7!? Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 8. Nc3  \n\nWhite sacrifices a knight to get Black's king out right away.  Proper defense is extremely difficult over the board, but played correctly, black is thought to have a slight advantage.

(Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)\n\nA: The Alekhine's defence (1.e4 Nf6) is also a great attacking weapon for black, as it is a highly aggressive and provocative opening that lures white into overextending its centre, which can then be targeted (generally) via the knights on c6 and b6, trading the knight on f3 for your light square bishop, and sometimes even castling on the queen side to really target white's d pawn.\nTake a look at the opening moves in the most common variations (Modern, Albert, Carlsen, 4 pawns, etc) and see if you like the resulting positions for black. It is a good practical weapon in tournament play, and white is frequently caught off-guard, as it is a rare opening (however, many world champions have played it (Fischer, Spassky, Tal, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe etc. and it is still sometimes used at the highest level today by Carlsen, Shabalov, Kamsky etc.)\n\nA: The Fried Liver is good, and according to Stockfish, black would NOT have a \&quot;slight advantage\&quot; even if they defend properly.\n\nA: Luccini Gambit\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 e5 2.

Qd5+\n\n\nA: I read all the comments , by your post I think you need a new opening to learn which has a solid reputation but aggressive in nature which always favorite of many chess player club players and grand masters . If you are trying to find new gambit lines then you can try The gambit  by M.yudovich , but if you want aggressive but solid openings first, I want to recommend you Vienna Game it also can transfer from the bishop's opening which goes like , 1.e4 e5 2. (Nc3/Bc4) (Nf6/Nc6/Bc5/others) 3.(Bc4/Nc3) {now after nf6 there is also frakenstein-dracula line which will be like 3..Nxe4 4.Qh5 which always a drawish line but you can pressurize your opponent and he/she can fall into your traps} 3....Bc5(after nf6) 4.d3 d6 5.Ne2 0-0 6.0-0 Nc6 7.Kh1 Be6 8.f4(and suddenly you can see it is a solid version of king's gambit) which always played by many top players recently it's been a fashion for top players to refute petrov defence or russian defence (1.e4 e5 2Nf3 Nf6). Now e4 is played for many many years to have the main purpose checkmate the king with controlling the f7 square. In the e4 lines I also like the opening called the Najdorf sicilian english attack, (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Be3) , 6. Bg5 is also aggressive which all comes into the main pawn race with g4 , g5 , and in the side of d4 openings solid and aggressive lines can be found in the A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire by Aaron Summerscale , ( the barry attack is one of favourites from that book which goes like 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 , with the plans of going in pawn race with h4 or g4 this opening also been mastered by GM mark hebden and also a new form of this opening been played by famous GM baadur jobava and the opening is named as jobava opening . Now you can also read A Ferocious Opening Repertoire by C. LAKDAWALA which includes veresov opening with f3 lines . And with black against e4 my favorite opening is najdorf (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6)and also can play tiger modern (1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6) and against d4 you can play Grünfeld Defence(1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5) and you can play dutch defence (1. d4 f5 ) and this is also aggressive but solid played by many player you will find many examples in the ginger gm youtube channel.I don't recognize benko gambit as a aggressive opening cause a if your opponent knows then it can be not an aggressive one.And also other openings.

They are related games and thus share some related concepts.  I believe Shogi showed me things about chess I had not understood before.\n\nA: Wikipedia has a pretty complete listing of chess variants broken down by:\n\n\n*Chess with different starting positions\n\n*Chess with different forces\n\n*Chess with different boards\n\n*Chess with unusual rules\n\n*Chess with incomplete information or elements of chance\n\n*Multimove variants\n\n*Multiplayer variants\n\n*Single player variants\n\n*Chess with unusual (fairy) pieces\n\n*Chess hybrids\n\n*Games inspired by chess\n\n\nA: In addition to the two nice answers already provided, I would like to mention the variant King of the hill, whose difference with normal checked is the following: in addition to checkmate, a legal move that moves one's own king to one of the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) wins.\nThis helps a lot for the control of squares. Indeed, one cannot neglect any center square. If one of the center squares is too weak, then soon or later the opponent will take profit of it.\n\nA: Playing other variants should only have a marginal effect on improvement, and sometimes it's bad(makes you think in ways optimal for the variant, but not for chess). Since others have not mentioned it, playing blindfold chess may help with visualizations, but probably can only be played after a certain level of competency in chess, but I suppose blindfold chess is generously defined as a chess variant.\nOf course the best way to improve at chess is to play/study chess.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/76\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;21\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: When is castling possible? Is castling possible if any of the squares involved in the castling are under attack, or is this a problem only if the squares moved through by the king are under attack and not the ones moved through by the rook?\n\nA: Yes, you can, as long as the king doesn't pass through or end up on an attacked square.\nFrom FIDE Laws of Chess:\n\n3.8.2.1   The right to castle has been lost:\n           \n3.8.2.1.1   if the king has already moved, or\n           \n3.8.2.1.2   with a rook that has already moved.\n3.8.2.2   Castling is prevented temporarily:\n           \n3.8.2.2.1   if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one\nor more of the opponent's pieces, or\n           \n3.8.2.2.2   if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected.\n\n\nA: You can castle when all of these conditions hold true:\n\n\n*\n\n*The King and the Rook did not make any moves so far.\n\n*The King is not in check.\n\n*The King will not pass a threatened square during castling.\n\n*The King will not land on a threatened square.\nCondition 3 might need clarification. For example, you have the white pieces and you want to castle kingside. Then, you are using your Ke1 and Rh1 for castling. Let's say that conditions 1 and 2 are fulfilled. Next, the g1 square should not be threatened in order to fulfill condition 4. Finally, the King will pass the square f1 on its way to g1. Thus, the square f1 should not be threatened for condition 3 to hold true!\n\nA: Yes, if the rook is threatened, you may still castle. The threatened squares rule only applies to squares where the king passes (starting and final position included).\nFor example, in the case of white castling queenside, for instance, a threat to a1 or b1 does not prevent the castle from taking place.\n\nA: One nice example of this is in this game, where a player named Feuer takes advantage of the ability to castle queenside while b1 is attacked to play a beautiful combination.\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n[Event \&quot;Belgian Championship\&quot;]\n[Site \&quot;Liege BEL\&quot;]\n[Date \&quot;1934\&quot;]\n[EventDate \&quot;?\&quot;]\n[Round \&quot;?\&quot;]\n[Result \&quot;1-0\&quot;]\n[White \&quot;Otto Feuer\&quot;]\n[Black \&quot;Alberic O'Kelly de Galway\&quot;]\n[ECO \&quot;C73\&quot;]\n[WhiteElo \&quot;?\&quot;]\n[BlackElo \&quot;?\&quot;]\n[PlyCount \&quot;25\&quot;]\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 d6 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6.d4 f6 7.Nc3\nRb8 8.Qd3 Ne7 9.Be3 Rxb2 10.dxe5 fxe5 11.Nxe5 dxe5 12.Qxd8+\nKxd8 13.O-O-O+ 1-0\n\n\nA: The rules are that the king can't castle into check, through check, or when in check. This applies to the king's square, plus the two squares to the right or left.\nCastling is permitted when the rook is under attack (on the rook's square). On the queen side, that would also include the knight's square. But not on the kingside, because the king would be castling into check. He also can't castle if the bishop's or queen's square is under attack. \n\nA: There is more on the condition to consider\nThe King and Rook have to be on the same rank, otherwise Pam-Krabbe castling would be possible.\nPam-Krabbe castling is basically a vertical castling, where the king would castle with a promoted pawn. This is not allowed anymore. \n\nA: Here is a problem that I published in the MatPlus.net forums a few months ago. It demonstrates how the rook can move through squares that are attacked.

However, this variation has recently fallen out of practice among top level GMs because white has been hard-pressed to find decent replies to the most critical lines. Basically, I would recommend playing one of the anti-Marshall games (8. h3 has been popular) unless you want to spend days studying opening theory to reach a suspect position with white.\nWikipedia has an article on the Marshall attack which is worth reading.\n\nA: The \&quot;classic\&quot; defense against the Marshall Attack was waged against Marshall himself by Jose Raul Capablanca, the future world champion, in 1918.  See this article about the game.\nSince then, lines have evolved on both sides, but the underlying principles remain the same. Master the one game, and you'll go a long way to mastering the defense as a whole.\n\nA: I'm posting this because this year some very interesting games have been played showing new ideas just discovered for White which can give an idea of how difficult it is to prepare especially at the very top level.\nThe first game that I want to mention is the game between Ivanchuk and Wesley So played this year in Wijk aan Zee. So played a new line (well known to the top players thanks to an article published by Anish Giri in New in Chess). Ivanchuk didn't know the line and got crushed. You can see an analysis of the game by the GM Jan Gustafsson here.\nThe second one is one played in the final of the World Cup in Baku between Peter Svidler and Sergey Karjakin which also displayed a very interesting line. It was a blitz game where Svidler got a huge advantage thanks to his better preparation but finally lost due to blundering a rook.\nTo sum up, if you're interested I recommend you the series of videos made by Jan Gustafsson for Chess 24 called Latest Trends on the Marshall where you can find some very interesting ideas for both Black and White like the two mentioned above.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/82\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;10\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: How can I to hold on to the pawn plus for black in the Queen's Gambit Accepted? A few years back I used to play with a player who always accepted the queens gambit pawn and used to hold on to it and sometimes win with the pawn plus.\nIs there any specific variation that can be studied in favour of black in queen's gambit accepted?\n\nA: Black can sometimes hold on to the Pawn if that is the goal.  Black has to play an early a6 and b5.  One possible variation is:\n[FEN \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 a6 4. e3 b5\n\nAlthough Black will hold on to the extra C-Pawn, White can counterattack with a4, b3, and Nc3.  Black has neglected development, and according to MegaBase 2012, White scores 60.6% from the diagrammed position with the move 5. a4.\n\nA: There are ways to hold onto the pawn, but most of them leave Black with a dreadful position where his entire position is built around hanging onto the pawn.  Moves like Be6, c6, b5, and Qa5 are examples of strategies that could be employed.\nIn the Slav and Semi-Slav defenses, there are in fact a lot of variations in which black is able to comfortably (somewhat) hold onto the pawn.  I would check those out if I were you.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/84\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;11\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: How to assess chess game composition? Most chess literature offer sets of moves based on themes, but do not offer a method of accessing your performance in composing sets of moves relative to the flow of the game itself. \nWhat would be the best way to segment sets of moves, and then assess the effectiveness of their composition relative to the board's state?\n\nA: I would try breaking your games down by sub-goals and examine the moves leading up to achieving that sub-goal which gives you an easy metric on how well the set of moves performed.  Of course, the harder part is to assess your sub-goals.  Did you have the right overall plan?  Did your sub-goals improve your position?  I'm not sure if breaking your evaluation down to the \&quot;set of moves\&quot; level will ultimately be useful.\nFor instance, you can set a sub-goal of controlling the c-file so the set of moves that contribute to doubling the rooks on the c-file evaluate as \&quot;good\&quot;.  However, if your opponent is invested in an attack on the king-side, your sub-goal might be faulty.\nTake a look at some middlegame books, games collections, and/or tournament books.  Try something like IM Jeremy Silman's \&quot;How To Reassess Your Chess\&quot; and/or GM Bronstein's annotations of the Zurich 1953 tournament.\nThe former will give you some ways to approach thinking about your position and formulating goals while the latter will delve into the thought process behind the moves of real games of grandmasters.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/85\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;7\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Is Chaturanga/Shatranj an early form of chess or is this altogether different? I had heard from someone that Chess evolved from Chaturanga then Shatranj.  Are there any pointers towards this?\nI would like to know counter arguments as well, if any.\n\nA: Chaturanga indeed is chess. In Hindi language Chaturanga (shatranj in Arablic), is what chess (which is in English) called.\n\nA: Chaturanga is the ancient game that gave birth to board games chess, shogi, makruk, xiangqi and janggi. I believe Chaturanga is the same game as Shatranj or got only slightly varied while moved from India to Sassanid Persia. There is another variation of chess Chaturaji which used 2 dices and 4 players (Ludo style) around 11th century or slightly earlier. The game of chess evolved from Shatranj and got most of the current rules around 15th century in Spain. It was only at late 19th century that Chess as we know of has been formalized.\n\nA: Those two games are indeed early forms of chess. The pieces were similar, although their moves were different, and there were some chess rules that had not yet been invented; however, chess evolved from those early games.\n\nA: I found this article very informative:\nhttp://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200904/the.game.of.kings.htm\nThese sections were particularly relevant:\n\nChess, however, was not invented in Persia. All early Persian references to chess use the term chatrang, from the Sanskrit chaturanga (“in four parts”), which describes the four components of an early Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. The use of a Sanskrit-derived word for chess in an early Persian romance suggests an Indian origin for the game and not local invention, although supporting evidence is murky.\n...\nThe only convincing early Indian mention of chess is in a romance attributed to the sixth century, thus slightly earlier than the first Persian and Central Asian evidence. The poet Subandhu used a chess image to describe the monsoon season:\nThe time of the rains played its game with frogs for chessmen which, yellow and green in color … leapt up on the black field squares.\nA story of the seventh-century Persian king Nushirvan (recorded by Firdawsi in the 11th-century Shahnamah, or Book of Kings) also supports an Indian origin of chess. An envoy came from India, the story says, “with elephants, parasols, and cavalry” and a chessboard, chessmen and a challenge: If Nushirvan’s courtiers could figure out the basic rules of the game, then unknown in Persia, the Indian king would gladly pay tribute to the Persian monarch. If they failed, however, Nushirvan would pay tribute to the Indian king. Nobles and priests labored without success for a week. Finally, after a day and a night of struggle, Nushirvan’s vizier deciphered and described the game:\nThe sage has invented a battlefield, in the midst of which the king takes up his station. To the left and right of him the army is disposed, the foot-soldiers occupying the rank in front. At the king’s side stands his sagacious counselor, advising him on the strategy to be carried out during the battle. In the two directions the elephants are posted with their faces turned toward the conflict. Beyond them are stationed the war-horses, on which are mounted two resourceful riders, and fighting alongside them to the left and right are turrets ready for the fray\n\n\nA: Chaturanga was evolved 2000 yrs ago. Chaturanga is based on Ashtpaad board (8×8) which was again modified. Many modern variants including Modern Chess are supposedly derived from Chaturanga.\nBefore Ashtpaad board, Dashpaad board existed on 10x10. If you go through the historical evidences, you will find these boards. On Dashpaad board, Shadyantra or Shatranjan was played. So, Dashpaad is the most ancient board, and Shad Yantra is the most oldest game.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/86\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;19\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: When and why was the notation changed from descriptive to algebraic? When I was young I used to play chess with the the old form of notation KB<number> (King Bishop square number), even books used to have the same notation, then later found that everyone was using algebraic, is descriptive notation dead? Why?\n\nA: To answer your question if descriptive notation is dead, I would say YES.  Even though it maybe more descriptive, it can be more confusing for newer players and the algebraic notation is so much more intuitive and simpler to understand.  I have read books with the descriptive notation and sometimes I scratch my head.\n\nA: I used to read chess books in the 1960's. Then DN was the only commonly understood system.  I didn't go looking for chess books again until this year 2018.  Now everything is in AN.  I have a book published in the 1970's bought recently second hand it actually uses both.  I recently found some chess magazines in Spanish from the 1990's they all use AN. \nFor me DN is much more intuitive...not really intuitive ...just common sense.  There are two people sitting at the board, so there really ARE two perspectives.\nWW\n\nA: Though the previous answers have made some solid points, I think they have not yet given the main reason why algebraic notation has generally come to be preferred over descriptive notation: it is more absolute, less relative, than descriptive notation. What I mean is just this: in algebraic notation each square on the chessboard receives only one name, while in descriptive notation each square receives a different name depending on whether a move by white is being notated or a move by black. This alone makes algebraic notation more transparent, because things aren't relative to which side is on the move.\nConsider, say, the g4 square (in algebraic notation). When white moves a piece there, descriptive notation says it is headed to KN4. But if black is moving a piece there, it is headed to KN5. There is just no need to have two names for this square, and it serves only to sow possible confusion in a way that algebraic notation does not.\n\nA: The two forms of notation you are referring to are called Descriptive Notation and Algebraic Notation respectively. Descriptive notation was the most used form from recent antiquity up until about 1970 in English speaking countries. Algebraic notation has been around since the 19th century, but didn't rise to its current prominence until the 20th century. These days, descriptive notation is considered obsolete, though it is still permitted in tournament play in the FIDE. There are a minority of players that exercise this choice, though. Primarily, descriptive notation is learned and used for reading older chess books which were authored that way.\nThere are also some other interesting notations in use around the world. Hope that helps clear things up.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/89\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;22\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Why is the King's Gambit not played often? I have observed that the King's Gambit is usually not played at international level.  Is there any specific reason for this?\n\nA: David Bronstein, in his book \&quot;The Modern Chess Self-Tutor,\&quot; gives an interesting explanation for not playing it. Don't forget, he's used it many times in GM practice, including memorable games against Tal and Petrosian (the latter was an exhibition game in which they explore more fully an idea from an Alekhine-Keres game).\nHis reasoning for 2. Nf3 being preferable to 2. f4 is that like 2. d4, 2. f4 fully declares White's intentions too early in the game. White is better off playing something like 2. Nf3, when Black still has no idea what sort of game White is aiming for. He doesn't think it's necessarily worse, just that playing it makes Black's choices easier. 2. Nf3 keeps White's options open.\n\nA: The King's Gambit is considered inferior because white is sacrificing king safety along with a pawn on move 2.  Furthermore, although white would get an attack going along the f file in Morphy's day, now the correct defensive ideas are known for black and white has a harder time of it.\nThat said, the King's Gambit is a great weapon at the club level.  In fact, Quality Chess will be releasing a book on the King's Gambit very soon.  \n\nA: One item that is not a reason that the King's Gambit isn't played more at the international level is this specious article from Chessbase News: \&quot;Busting the King's Gambit, this time for sure.\&quot; In the article, Vasik Rajlich, the author of Rybka, claims that all moves but 3.Be2 lead to a forced win for Black, while that move draws. However, though this was posted on April 2, 2012, rather than on April 1, the article was in fact one of Chessbase's annual April Fools' posts.\n\nA: Top players don't play sharp gambits such as this one much because they involve lots of forced lines. These lines are easy to calculate for an engine. The result is that you no longer play against your opponent - you're pitting your engine / memorization skills vs. theirs, and not your chess ability vs. theirs.\nSource: Romantic chess in modern times\n\n\nA: Typically, White wants to play the King's gambit to play some crazy lines, full of sacrifices and double-edged play like the Kieseritzky Gambit:\n\n\n    [FEN \&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\&quot;]\n\n    1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 Nf6\n\n\n\nWith a messy position on move 5 already !\nAnd there are so many lines like that if Black is ready to accept the challenge. But that is a big IF.\nFirst, there is this defense advocated by Fischer everyone is mentioning that seems to be OK for black:\n\n\n    [FEN \&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\&quot;]\n\n    1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6\n\n\n\nThis move d6 simply removes the e5-square for the Knight, and this alone makes White's attack harder to carry on.\nBut I think that, really, what can discourage White to play the King's gambit, especially at higher level, is that Black can simply opt for an early d7-d5 setup, that usually gives a full (and quite boring) equality:\n\n\n    [FEN \&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\&quot;]\n\n    1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 exf4\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, after these 3 move, it is hard to see how White can attack...\nCheck my introduction on the King's gambit if you want to get an idea on how to play this nevertheless interesting opening.\n\nA: One of the more common lines for the King's Gambit is accepting, followed by 3. Nf3.  That is, 1. e4 e5  2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3.  After this, black can follow with 3... d6, \nthe so called Fischer defense.  Fischer was extremely confident that this was a bad position for white.  He wrote an entire article about this line, and famously said, \&quot;In my opinion the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force.\&quot;  On top of this he added, \&quot;Of course White can always play differently, in which case he merely loses differently.\&quot;\nI am not sure about other lines, but likely top grandmasters have analyzed them, and come to similar conclusions that white's position is not a good one.\nRemark: Interestingly Fischer himself played the gambit a few times with great success, but he opened 3. Bc4. \n\nQ: Why is the King's Gambit not played often? I have observed that the King's Gambit is usually not played at international level.  Is there any specific reason for this?\n\nA: (I'm adding another answer because it's fundamentally different from the one I wrote above.)\nGMs don't play the King's Gambit because it's inferior.\n\nEventually, Leela reached the safe harbour that is the dream of every King’s Gambit player: a worse but holdable ending!\n\nSource (in the comments to games 19-20)\nIn other words, at GM level, your target when you play the King's Gambit is a worse but holdable ending. This is reflected by the opening eval that engines give - usually around -1 after 1. e4 e5 2. f4.\nSince White has an advantage in the starting position &amp; you should be playing to win, a worse but holdable endgame is not acceptable. By extension, GMs don't play the King's Gambit.\n(At amateur level the dream of every King's Gambit player is a mating attack in the middlegame.)\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/94\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;22\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What are some helpful chess tactics training websites?

Nf6, white's best plan is to play d3 and Bg5.  Black can't move the bishop because it is pinned (so the queen can't be trapped until black castles).\n\nA: No, the Damiano Defense does not lose by force so it's not a bad opening.\nIf you analyze it with a computer you won't be able to find a variation that wins for white against best play.\nAfter 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5, playing 3...fxe5 will lose for black but playing 3...Qe7 will hold the game.

Ke7, but if you're into silly \&quot;psychological\&quot; justifications for moves, you could argue that 4... Ke7 makes White think a little harder to find the win, while Black can prep it.\n4. ... Ke7 \n5. Qxe5+ Kf7 \n6. Bc4+ d5\n7.

Is there any specific point where the middle-game ends and end-game begins? E.g. after x number of pieces are exchanged, or say 40 moves, etc.\n\nA: According to the classic old book of Romanovski (which was one of the cornerstones of the Russian/Soviet school of chess) the endgame starts when the King assumes an active role.\n\nA: The middle game starts as soon as the opening ends, and well, it is very easy to know when openings start and end, almost any opening (if not all) have names and are well known and studied. But if I were forced to say an specific moment in time, I would say around the time where they start castling or exchanging serious material to gain position advantage.\nHowever, the end game is harder to accurately say when it starts, my best guess will be somewhere where the kings start moving towards the center and players have usually no more than 2 minor pieces or 4 pawns. Anytime where it is possible to calculate the result using Endgame Tablebases.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the point where something starts and ends vary from game to game (e.g if the players decide to quickly exchange material they will get to the endgame pretty soon), and some games don't even have end games (or even middle games!) if they blunder or fall in traps.\n\nA: Quoting from rate your endgame by Edmar Mednis\n\&quot;...perhaps this is clearer when approached negatively\&quot;\nWhat does this mean? Well we know in endgames and middlegames, there are totally different plans. The most well known example is undoubtedly the Isolated Queen Pawn(IQP) case. IQP can offer dynamic chances in middlegame, but it's always a weakness in endgames. So by working retrogressively, we can know what phase we are in.\nIn middlegame\nBetter development, open file and misplaced pieces etc are crucial\nIn endgame\nPawn structure, availability of passed pawns, availability of weak pawns are crucial\nFor example\n[FEN \&quot;3r1r2/1bp5/1p3k1p/pP4p1/4Pp1P/2P2P2/1P4RB/4R1K1 w - - 0 1\&quot;]\n\nIn this position, we clearly know that black has advantage, due to white's bad bishop and black's control over d-file. White, despite having a protected passed pawn and created a black backward pawn has no advantage.\nHence, we know that this position is a middlegame.\nNote that there is not much mentioning of how much material must be removed before endgame starts. This is due to the fact that endgames can occur despite large amount of material on board. E.g. Queen pawn vs Queen pawn, Queen Rook Pawn vs Queen rook pawn and so on\n\nA: There isn't a clear-cut definition of endgame, or a set of criteria where you could draw a line and say \&quot;after this move, we have reached the endgame.\&quot;\nQuoting Glenn Flear in his excellent book Practical Endgame Play - Beyond the Basics:\n\nThe word 'endgame' is widely used and generally implies the final phase of the game  (however long!), assuming that there already has been significant simplification.  If we had to define the word more rigorously in terms of material then opinions vary.  Some specialists consider all queenless positions to be endgames, others those where both sides have limited material, for instance less than queen and rook.\n\nSo basically, once the position becomes 'simplified' to the point where more often than not you are using your few remaining pieces (including the King) to try and queen a pawn, rather than organize an attack.  Also included would be the end result of queening a pawn (or winning significant material), i.e. positions where you mate the King with only a few pieces on the board, like King and Rook vs. King.\n\nA: One old definition of the endgame was when the main objective is to \&quot;queen a pawn,\&quot; (as opposed to other goals such as forcing an imminent checkmate).\nNow there is an exception noted in the comments where one side will try to mate the other side's lone king with a king and two bishops, or a king, bishop and knight. But it's likely that one side obtained this material advantage by trying to queen extra pawns, and forcing the other side to trade pieces for them. \n\nA: The endgame begins when the kings can wander out from their hiding places without risking being checkmated.\n\nA: Opening is the phase of the game where your strategic goal is to develop and you aim to build some sort of (direct or indirect) territory control: either an advantage or simply an unbalance.\nMiddlegame is when you start to use that territory control to achieve the next strategic goal like a direct attack (tactics is incidental here, not a purpose per se) or a conversion to a position where other strategic goals can be pursued like liquidation into a favorable ending.\nEnding is either when you have built a positional/material advantage big enough and you simplify to remain in a position where you can force a win whatever defense the opponent uses, or more generally when you play to gain that advantage as main purpose.\nOf course one can try gain to obtain a winning material advantage in the middlegame, but that is incidental and not the main goal one follows: material advantage is obtained, besides blunders, as consequence of/defence against some sort of direct attack.\nIn the endgame direct attack instead are used as threats and the main goal is as said reaching a forcefully winning positional or material advantage.\n\nQ: When does the middlegame end and the endgame begin? Is there any specific point where the middle-game ends and end-game begins? E.g. after x number of pieces are exchanged, or say 40 moves, etc.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/106\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;40\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Are there endgames which could be forced wins if not for the 50-move rule? Wikipedia's article on the fifty-move rule states:\n\nAll of the basic checkmates can be accomplished in well under 50 moves. However, in the 20th century it was discovered that some positions of certain endgames can only be won in more than fifty moves (without a capture or a pawn move). The rule was changed to include certain exceptions in which one hundred moves were allowed with particular material combinations. However, more and more exceptions were discovered and in 1992 FIDE abolished all such exceptions and reinstated the strict fifty-move rule.\n\nI have never seen an example of this, though I used to think the K, N, B vs. K ending was one.  When is it possible to force a win in 50 moves or more, but not less than 50 moves?\n\nA: Yes, there are quite a few endgames that require more than 50 moves with best play from the defender.\nWikipedia has a list of material imbalances where it could take more than 50 moves depending on the specific position.  Here are a few examples:\n\n\n*Rook and bishop vs lone rook (often a draw though)\n\n*Two bishops vs a lone knight \n\n*Two knights vs a lone pawn (the defender must have a pawn)\n\n*Four knights vs a lone queen (would never happen over the board…)\n\n*Queen and rook vs queen and rook\n\n*Two queens vs two queens\n\n\nA: A more comprehensive list of endgames sorted by the number of moves it could take to mate (based on Nalimov tablebases) is at http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/longest-checkmates/longest-checkmates-sorted-by-length.shtml\nThese vary in length from 1 move to 262 moves.  It does not include the mate in 549 because that endgame has 7 pieces on the board and the tablebases only include positions with up to 6 pieces on the board.\nAs for KBN vs. K, that can be done in 33 moves.\n\nA: The following KNN v KPP endgame position is one:\n\nPly count=0. Black to play. White win without 50 move rule. Draw under 50 move rule.\nThis is the third position in the \&quot;two knights v pawn\&quot; section of Averbakh's \&quot;Knight Endings\&quot; (Batsford edition) where it gives a White win in 17 moves, but Black's defence can be improved.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/130\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;18\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What is the worst opening move, and why?

If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.\n\nA: 1. h4 has been deemed the worst move by John Watson (author of the Mastering the Chess Openings series). Other people are saying 1. h3 and 1. a3. That is not true. Michael Basman is a noted unorthodox player that opens with 1. a3/h3, etc. and is rated >2400. 1. a3/h3 come out to be useful in a variety of openings, but it's certainly not what I would start with.\n\nA: I agree 1. f3 is quite bad, but 1. Na3 and 1. Nh3 aren't pretty either, especially as they have to move again to avoid a doubled pawn after ...d5 or ...e5.\n\nA: 1.Nh3 and 1.Na3 (Ammonia attack, Sodium attack) are REALLY bad. It breaks the \&quot;move one piece one time\&quot; rule, and 1.Nh3 blocks h3, a good move to prevent back-rank mate.\n\nA: I'm just trying to protect a move that's mentioned above as being perhaps one of the worst. Grandmaster Mednis years ago wrote a little opening theory book (\&quot;How to play good opening moves,\&quot; Edmar Mednis, ISBN-13: 978-0679141099) in which he states that\n1.g3\nis one of White's perfect opening move choices, when followed by\n2.Bg2.\nHe does mention some of White's awful first move choices, but doesn't rank their badness.\n\nA: 1. g4 ... 2. f3??\nThis is a horrendous opening (especially in combination with the second move) because it severely undermines the ability to castle on the king's side, very aggressively throws a pawn into action where it has no defenders and isn't helping any cause in particular. \ng4 allows to fianchetto the light-square bishop, as well as hide the dark square bishop behind it later, if needed, which is an odd, but somewhat redeeming quality, but as soon as it's followed by 2. f3, the light-square bishop is entombed and white have ZERO center control or active development for whole 3 tempi, allowing black to gain a MASSIVE center presence and advantage. And after 1. ...d5 followed by 2. ...h5 the g4 square now belongs to the black and sets a great entry point to a king-side attack. If white tried to take on g5, black now has a semi-open file without ever moving the rook. Thanks for that! \nSuch a horrible game would typically go like this: 1. g4 d5  2. f3 e5  3. Bg2 h5 - and black is 2+ points in the lead without having taken a single piece yet, according to any decent engine. White would need a major miracle and a blunder from black to have any chance to recover from that.\nExample: Hou Yifan throws game\n\nA: The idea of the opening moves is to allow an early development of pieces. Therefore the worst moves would be the ones that allow you the least opportunity to do so. So I would say 1. a3, 1. h3, and 1. f3 would be the worst. You not only lose the race in developing your pieces quickly (the only piece you can develop after these moves is the knight), but you also give up control on the central squares.\n\nA: I would say 1. Na3.  The reason is that it is the most useless move as far as building a setup around it.  Even moves mentioned like 1. h4 and 1. f3 can be useful in some contexts - 1. f3 can be useful if you play d4 and Nc3 and plan e4.  1. h4 can be useful because you discourage your opponent from fianchettoing his bishop, and you can push it again for cramping effect.  It is difficult, however, to imagine any setup where 1. Na3 is a helpful move, and furthermore after ...e5 you will have to move the knight or play b3 to avoid getting doubled a-pawns, which are probably the worst doubled pawns since the open b-file is rarely useful and they are not supporting anything or guarding any important squares.\n\nA: 1. f3 is almost certainly the single worst move.  It irrevocably weakens white's king position without doing anything useful.  \nOther moves like 1. b3 and 1. g3 prepare to develop a bishop, so they're not so bad.  1. c3 doesn't do too much for white, but it also doesn't hurt him.\n1. a4 and 1. h4 both ignore the center, but they do help develop the rooks, and there are positions where 1. a4/h4 can be useful (especially when the kings have castled on opposite sides of the board.\n\nQ: What is the worst opening move, and why? Grouping of initial moves of a chess game are well known, though I've never seen analysis of the worst possible opening move, any thoughts? If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.\n\nA: I would say 1. Nh3. \n1.f3 is bad however after g3 white is only down a couple of tempos and has a somewhat reasonable position. \n1.Nh3 allows black the potential to to wreck white's pawn structure and even threaten a very quick mate. Yes, white can avoid that with Ng4->Nf3 but you've wasted two tempos when you could have done the same thing with 1.Nf3  \nWhite is in a struggle for equality after 1.Nh3 and is one slip away from losing the game for the next several moves. Even if white does play perfectly, he has thrown away several tempi for no reason and allowed an equal game. \n\nA: 1.f3\nPROS\nThe only pros of the opening is some small center support.\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*This opening weakens the king's safety. The f pawn is an important shelter of the e1-h4 diagonal and the g1-b7 diagonal so moving it makes the kingside pawn structure destroyed.\n\n*This opening don't open any lines fo development, and it blocked the knight!\n\n*Wasted tempo.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nI do not suggest it for anyone\n1.h4 and 1.a4\nPROS\nNone\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't open any lines nor development.\n\n*Weakens pawn structure.\n\n*Wasted tempo.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nI do not suggest it for anyone\n1.h3 and 1.a3\nPROS\nDoes not weaken anything.\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*Wasted tempo.\n\n*No development lines.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nFor white players who want to play black.\n1.Na3\nPROS\n\n*\n\n*It can develop to c4 or c2 but that would waste some tempos.\n\n*Support c pawn, but can't the c pawn move already?\n\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*After 1...d5 and an exchange the pawn structure is lost.\n\n*Wasted tempo.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nOnly in blitz.\n1.Nh3\nPROS\n\n*\n\n*It can use another tempo to go to f4.\n\n*I'm surprised at nobody mentioning it, but it protects f2!\n\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*Wasted tempo\n\n*After 1...e5 and exchange the pawn structure is lost... and the f2 protection is gone!\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR PLAYING\nOnly in blitz.\n1.c3\nPROS\nSupport d4\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*No development and blocks knight\n\n*Wasted tempo.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nFor Caro Kann players.\n1.g4\nPROS\nOpen lines for bishop development\nCONS\n\n*\n\n*The g pawn is undefended.\n\n*Weakens kingside.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR PLAYING\nOnly in blitz.\nThe third most bad is 1.Na3?! and 1.Nh3?!\nThe second most bad is 1.h4?! and 1.a4?!\nThe most bad is 1.f3?!\n\nA: I agree with Andrew on 1. f3 (Barnes Opening).  No first move can be decisively wrong, but some first moves are questionable.  In Chess Opening Theory (Wikibooks):\n\nQuite a rarely played passive starting move that gives up White's first move advantage. White's position is slightly weakened by the White King exposure to a check on the h4 - e1 diagonal. The kingside Knight's favourite developing square f3, is also not currently possible. In fact, this is arguably the worst possible first move by White.\nNo stats as 1. f3 occurs rarely among serious chess players.\n\nNext on the list would probably be 1. h4 (Desprez Opening):\n\n1. h4 is a rather useless move that does nothing to assist the important central squares. No top masters have ever used it in professional play, although some, most notably Hikaru Nakumura, play it during blitz. It could be said that White has made his position worse, as castling kingside is now less attractive.\nThis move is rarely seen among serious chess players.\n\n\nQ: What is the worst opening move, and why? Grouping of initial moves of a chess game are well known, though I've never seen analysis of the worst possible opening move, any thoughts? If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.\n\nA: Just tell you one thing, 1.f3 is bad, it does not control the center actually, it stopped the knight, and it place the king in danger. Sometimes even followed by 2.Kf2, I think this is the hammerschlag variation, further weakening the king, this is to laugh at beginners, but no one have win me with it yet. \n\nA: The other moves cited, especially 1.f3, are bad, but I would rather plead the case of the ugly Grob opening, 1.g4?.\nPawns do not go back, so this double step weakening is much more committing than a one step pawn move. After, say 1...e5, White has not only lost time, he has also:\n\n\n*Self-destroyed the most natural shelter for his own king, reached by short castle.\n\n*created weaknesses for himself, as Pg4 can and will be targeted by Bc8 or Ph5.\n\n*got himself a disadvantage in the fight for the center.\n\nIf, in some kind of handicapped game, I could choose my opponent's first move in order to maximize my chances, I would rather force him to play 1.g4 than anything else.\n\nA: For an objective take on this question, one might take a look at the Chessok Opening Tree:\n\n*\n\n*1.f3 -0.33\n\n*1.g4 -0.29\n\n*1.Nh3 -0.22\n\n*1.b4 -0.18\n\n*1.h4 -0.18\n\nGiven that white should be able to achieve a plus of 0.11 (according to the Tree) these are the only moves that not only lose the first move advantage but more than reverse it.\nOf course these computer evaluations have to be taken with a grain of salt, but they do bear out the intuition of experienced players and provide some food for thought (especially to adherents of the Sokolski …).\n\nA: The worst move is 1. resigns. It goes from equal to lost in one move, much worse than moves like 1. f3 which go from equal to slightly worse.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/132\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;41\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:29,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What is the fastest way for a player to reach the stage where they are not opening with nonsense moves? Assuming a player knows the rules, are there any free, one-player simulations that will rapidly teach a single player on their own how to move beyond opening with nonsense moves. \n\nA: The concept that caused me to stop making nonsense moves is control the center.\nThat meant moving out the d and e pawns, possibly with the c and f pawns, either abreast, or in support. More likely, I'd move a knight to c3 or f3 (c6 or f6 if Black), then a bishop or two. Castle as soon as possible, before undertaking activities on the wings.\nThat eliminated a lot of bad opening moves like b3, g3, and worse, a4 and h4.\n\nA: In the area of openings, I don't think a one-player simulation will serve you as well as a good read. For a start, I would suggest the Wikibook Chess Opening Theory, perhaps after reading the more basic version.\nOf course, experience playing with others will strengthen your opening a good deal, once you have the principles down.\n\nA: I'd be careful of the word 'nonsense' since it means different things to different people.  Kasparov would consider nonsense things that you or I would consider totally groovy.\nI think a player can learn the main lines of a few openings and learn the basic principles behind those moves (occupy the center, develop pieces...) in not too much time.\nHow long before you can find the correct response to the 10th move of a sharp variation of the Ruy Lopez?  Perhaps a bit longer.\n\nA: Open with 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. g3, 4. Bg2 and then do whatever you want.  By that point, it's hard to find nonsense moves that aren't obviously nonsense.  Finding the best move is very difficult, but if you're a beginner you don't need to worry about it.\n\nA: Pick ONE opening and specialise in it.  Do not worry about any other openings. For black that is a bit harder but you can find sound defenses to limit how much you need to know. \nPlay over GM games with that opening.  Play every one you can find.  Be totally familiar with all the usual variations and how the middle games turned out. \n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/133\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;4\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Has AI changed opening theory, and if so, how?

Due to the tactical prowess of even common computer programs it's pretty easy to ensure that variations contain no unexpected barbs.\n\nA: I would say not yet. I would think what is called AI (it is not actually AI but that's a different discussion) has made some people question how they approach chess and maybe led to some ideas but I wouldn't say AI has made any significant contributions to theory.\nWhen matches are held between traditional engines and AI engines they are held in conditions that greatly favor the AI engine.

I have recently heard that the only 5% percent out of entire chess players are women. I find this suspicious. Who says that only men can play chess? Is this statistic true, and if it is, why?\n\nA: I don't know that it's 95%, but it's close.\nWhy aren't there more female players?  Probably a combination of things certainly including cultural gender bias.  Women can surely play the game but American culture doesn't seem to reward them for it.\nIn about 1990, my B-player rating would have put me in the top 50 women players in the country.  A little later, the US got a lot of immigration from ex-Soviet Bloc countries.  This included a very good number of strong female players.  I can only surmise that their cultures were more supportive of the women. \nFurther, I feel the game was invented as a war game by men for men and as such probably has a certain character that is best appreciated by men.\nCompare to Go, a game of remarkable complexity, which has a much higher level of female participation.\n\nA: Among active players in the United States, about 15% seem to be women.\nIf you look at the rankings on this page, there are currently 9513 women active out of 64634 total players. That's 14.7%.\nMy guess is that the composition of female players skews more heavily towards juniors than the composition of male players, but I didn't find any numbers on that. I say this because I saw more female players at scholastic tournaments as a child than I do now at open tournaments as an adult.\n\nA: \nI have recently heard that the only 5% percent out of entire chess\n  players are women.\n\nIn 2018 this is certainly false. The statistics from the November 2018 FIDE rating list are that there are 668785 active players of whom 99325 are female. That is a female participation rate of about 15%.\nUpdate January 2020: The statistics from the January 2020 FIDE rating list are that there are 771484 active players of whom 120065 are female. That is a female participation rate of about 15.6%.\nThe statistics from the May 2012 FIDE list (when you wrote this question) are that were 87538 active players of whom 7226 were female. That is a female participation rate of 8.25%. So even when you wrote this question your number was inaccurate.\nThe big difference between May 2012 and today in FIDE rating terms is that the current figures also include rapid and blitz and also FIDE's online Arena for online chess. FIDE rating of rapid and blitz only started with the July 2012 list and has grown massively since then. I believe the FIDE online Arena only started in late 2015.\nOne other factor also affects the figures and that is that the FIDE default when a new player is recorded is male. If the registering federation does not specify sex then the player is registered as male. This obviously introduces distortions in the figures. It should be noted that FIDE has made great efforts in more recent times to clean up its data and correct errors. More recent FIDE data is more accurate than older data.\nNow I don't know which federation you come from so your figure could be accurate for your federation even though it is inaccurate overall.\nFigures vary wildly by federation and not necessarily in the way that you might imagine (unless you listen to Jordan Peterson). \nLooking at the female participation rate (100 x active female players / active players for federations with 100 or more active players) gives these 10 federations as bottom of the list from the May 2012 list -\nCzech Republic - 4%\nSpain - 3.9%\nSweden - 3.8%\nNepal - 3.4%\nItaly - 3.3%\nFinland - 2.6%\nBelgium - 2.5%\nSwitzerland - 2.3%\nIreland - 2.1%\nDenmark - 1.5%   \nAnd here are the top 5 from the May 2012 list -\nVietnam - 39.1%\nGeorgia - 33.7%\nChina - 31.2%\nEcuador - 23.8%\nAzerbaijan - 23.6%   \nHere are the corresponding figures from the November 2018 list (restricted to federations with 1000 or more active players - about 10x as many active players so increase the \&quot;noise\&quot; filter by 10x).\nFirst the bottom 10 -\nSweden - 6.3%\nIsrael - 6.3%\nSwitzerland - 5.9%\nArgentina - 5.3%\nNetherlands - 4.8%\nNorway - 4.8%\nFinland - 4.4%\nIreland - 4.2%\nDenmark - 2.7%\nLibya - 0.9%\nAnd the top 5 -\nMongolia - 41.9%\nUnited Arab Emirates - 35.6%\nSri Lanka - 34.0%\nVietnam - 32.5%\nMalaysia - 28.3%   \n\nWho says that only men can play chess?\n\nNobody says that and the statistics certainly don't say that either. What they do suggest is that men want to play chess much more than women. Where women have a greater choice of what sort of things they can do, as in the Scandinavian countries, it appears that many more of them have better things to do with their time than play chess ;-).\nPS It's a shame there isn't an international knitting federation publishing data we could use to extract male participation rates in knitting.\nNB For anybody interested in the raw data, FIDE publish rating file data going back to 2001. For data before 2001 there is the Olimpbase site, but their data is very \&quot;dirty\&quot; and will need a lot of work to eliminate/merge duplicates and correct obviously false data before it can be used.\n\nQ: Is it true that Chess is generally more played by men? I have recently heard that the only 5% percent out of entire chess players are women. I find this suspicious. Who says that only men can play chess? Is this statistic true, and if it is, why?\n\nA: Chess tends to impersonate war.\nNo one says women can't fight, but it's usually considered (culturally) as more of a men's activity, don't you think ?\nI'm very curious about the “why” aspect myself, but that probably calls for much socio-psychology I'm not near knowledgeable enough at, and probably isn't even well known yet, not to mention far from the scope of this site.\nFor real statistics, I guess scripting over a FIDE ratings database wouldn't be too hard, probably even mentioned in the introductory section of Women in Chess.\nMost people (and other answers) cite a 5-15% figure.\n\nA: Despite all feminist claims, it's not cultural, but biological.  In countries where supposedly the culture is more supportive for equality in activities (like USSR), males are by far relatively predominant in chess, the same as in US.  It's the same with careers.  It hasn't made much of a difference now that engineering, for instance, has been a field accessible to women for a long time.  Most of them simply prefer social activities more.  As Desmond Morris says, the brains of men and women work differently from each other.  This doesn't imply any inferiority, simply there are activities more suited for men and activities more suited for women.  E.g. dyslexia is almost wholly an issue for men, not for women.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/162\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;11\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:32,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Engines that predict the outcome of current matches in real-time I'm looking for an engine that will allow a full game to be loaded in an attempt to visualize the major turning points in the game.

Key in the move, and it will produce a score.  The score implies how well one side is doing.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/166\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;0\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: What is the best defense against the King's Indian Attack? How can I break the King's Indian Attack? I think my h7 square is vulnerable to attack; what is the best way to break this strategy?\n\nA: I doubt that the King's Indian Attack can be 'broken'.  It's a very solid position that White takes the time to setup, if Black is not careful, White may be able to gain space on the kingside, with moves such as e5, and develop dangerous attacks if Black has castled there.\nAs for h7 being weak, many things need to happen from Black in order for this to be realized (such as a semi-open h-file, Bg7 has been exchanged, in which case it is h6 that is weaker), so there may not be anything there worth exploring.\nI can't comment on what the 'best' defense would be, but there are many good ones, one such is the Botvinnik System.  Black makes use of the extra available tempi to set up a strong and flexible defense.  The typical structure would be pawns at c5, e5, d6, g6 and pieces at Nc6, Nge7, Bg7 and 0-0.  Black has a firm control over the d4 square and can potentially break with either ...b5 or ...f5.\n\nA: I recently faced a very similar problem when I organized a King's Indian Attack themed blitz tournament at my club. The problem is that it takes quite a few moves to establish White's KIA position and I had to find moves for black that preserved Black's flexibility in light of the many Youtube videos out there that promise to \&quot;crush Black with the KIA\&quot; :-).\nThe solution I came up with was to follow a line recommended by England's \&quot;Ginger GM\&quot;, Simon Williams in his series of videos on the French Defence. It goes like this:\n[fen \&quot;\&quot;]\n1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 Nc6 5. g3 g6 6. Bg2 Bg7 7. O-O Nge7 8. Re1 b6\n\nThere are a number of ideas here.\n\n\n*\n\n*The King's knight has gone to e7 not f6. This is important because it takes the sting out of e5 by White and of ed. The e file is blocked by the knight on e7 and Black's king sheltered.   \n\n*Black has delayed castling. There is no urgency and castling queenside may be more appropriate. In any case don't castle automatically into the programmed KIA king's side attack. Make your opponent think! Try and frustrate his plans.   \n\n*Black is ready to meet ed with ed and O-O. If necessary then a5, Ra7 will redeploy the queenside rook along the 7th rank opening up new defensive and attacking possibilities.   \n\n*Black will meet e5 with moves like Qc7 and g5 with the idea of exchanging his g pawn for White's e pawn and if White defends with Qe2 Black will happily initiate the exchange of queens on e5. Black is more likely to castle queenside in this variation   \n\n*If White follows a traditional move order with moves like c3, Nf1 h5 etc then Black will respond with something like h6, a5, Ra7, Rd7 with threats to play either de to embarrass the White queen or d4 to drive a wedge into the center and take space.\n\n\nOf course this does not refute the KIA but it does give a flexible and rich way to combat White players who bang out the first 10 or 12 moves like an automaton.\n\nA: So far, I’ve had success with the Pachman System, d5 g6 Bg7 e5 Ne7. If they play d4 before you can get the e5 off, you can go for Nf6, Nd7, and Nb6, allowing you to capture any c4 pawn, and get a good position while they recapture.\n\nA: I believe that the best way is to stop your opponent from getting an imbalance by copying White's setup. This will lead to drawish positions, if you are aiming for a draw. If you are aiming for a win, then you should then control the center after these moves.\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/176\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;5\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Is there fiction dealing with retrograde chess analysis?

Upon close inspection the position reveals mysterious things that I won't spoil.\n\nA: There's also A Happy Solution by Raymond Allen.  It's a short story (under 6000 words), but quaint. It appeared in The Strand Magazine in 1916.\nThe puzzle featured in Allen's tale was posted here in Chess.com's forums:\n[FEN \&quot;2BK3N/NP1P1PPb/P4P2/3p1q2/1Q1P1b2/1pB1p1p1/p1p2pp1/1kr4r w - - 0 1\&quot;]\n\nWhile Chess.com's puzzle is set up for Black to force mate, it is also the board that Kenneth Dale did a retrograde analysis on.  The game was between Sir James Winslay and Lord Churt.  When a banknote was found to have been pilfered, Churt's secretary Gornay was remembered to have been watching the game, but no one could vouch for how long.  Gornay's innocence appeared inviolate, as he was also remembered to have made several remarks on some of the past moves of the game at its conclusion:\n\n\&quot;If the play was rather eccentric sometimes, I must say it was bold and dashing enough on both sides,\&quot; Gornay commented. \&quot;For instance, when Lord Churt gave up his knight for nothing, and when you gave him the choice of taking your queen with either of two pawns at your queen's knight's sixth.\&quot; He turned to Churt. \&quot;Possibly you might have done better to take the queen with the bishop's pawn instead of with the rook's.\&quot;\n\nAfter this, the missing note was found in the wrong envelope, and Dale suspected that Gornay may have been the one who had moved the note, in order to frame Dale in case of the note's being found.\n\n\&quot;Was he in the library all the time you were playing?\&quot; Kenneth asked.\n\&quot;I can't say that,\&quot; Churt replied. \&quot;I don't think he was. I didn't notice particularly. But I am positive that he did not enter or leave the room while I was standing looking at Winslade's move, and he must have been there when Winslade offered his queen and when I took it, because he was commenting on those very moves after the game was finished, and suggesting that I might have done better to take with the other pawn. You heard him yourself.\&quot;\n\nDale later proved that Gornay could have figured out those previous moves simply by looking at the resigned game, and therefore had been free to leave the room and do his dirty work while the game was still underway.\n\nA: [TITLE \&quot;chess position from The Flanders Panel book\&quot;]\n[FEN \&quot;1nb5/pp1p4/PRP5/pR6/k1K1P3/2P5/2qP1P2/1NrnQB2 w - - 0 1\&quot;]\n\nFor the retro logic in the \&quot;The Flanders Panel\&quot; to work, there are two assumptions required: (1) there were no promotions (2) the black queen was royal, i.e. could not have been left exposed to attack. The solvers also assume that it was Black who moved last: perhaps there is some clue mentioned in the painting (e.g. Ferdinand of Ostenburg pushing the chess clock :D). If you accept those conditions, then the retro logic works out OK, in what is a well-written &amp; atmospheric historical thriller.\nIt is so much better than the corresponding composition in the movie of the book, renamed \&quot;Uncovered\&quot;, and starring Kate Beckinsale. The diagram is:  \n[TITLE \&quot;chess position from Uncovered movie\&quot;]\n[FEN \&quot;2n1r1k1/bQ2p1r1/p4p1q/6pp/1P5P/R5PK/2BR4/4N3 w - - 0 1\&quot;]\n\nThe retroanalysis is simply bonkers, but most of the analysis concerns the forward play, in what is initially a balanced position, but which is thrown away by the \&quot;expert\&quot; player representing White in a series of moves not much better than those in \&quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass\&quot;.  \nThe total blunder 1.Ra5? is played in the movie (Stockfish prefers 1.Qd7!) 1...g4+! 2.Kh2!

What happens? Especially in blitz or bullet games, it is possible that a player makes an illegal move, for example castles through check. \n\n\n*If the opponent does notice the illegal move, then as far as I know the first player is obliged to make a legal move with the same piece, if one exists. What if there are no legal moves? \n\n*What if the opponent, being in time pressure, doesn't notice the illegal move and makes a move. What happens after they realize that? Does the person who made the illegal move forfeit? Or is the whole game cancelled?\n\nAre there any standard rules for these kinds of situations?\n\nA: This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute \&quot;bonus\&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.\n\nA: \nA player who makes an illegal move must retract that move and make a\n  legal move. That move must be made with the same piece if possible,\n  because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an\n  attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to\n  the rook. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to\n  the best evidence. If the mistake is only noticed later on, the game\n  should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred\n  (Schiller 2003:24–25). Some regional organizations have different\n  rules.\nIf blitz chess is being played (in which both players have a small,\n  limited time, e.g. five minutes) the rule varies. A player may correct\n  an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock. If a player\n  has pressed their clock, the opponent may claim a win if he or she\n  hasn't moved. If the opponent moves, the illegal move is accepted and\n  without penalty (Schiller 2003:77).\n\nSOURCE: Rules of Chess, Illegal move\n&quot;},&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;en_language\&quot;: true,\n  \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://chess/questions/181\&quot;,\n  \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2023-05-29T00:00:00\&quot;,\n  \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;stackexchange\&quot;,\n  \&quot;question_score\&quot;: \&quot;40\&quot;\n}&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:36,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q: Why was 50 chosen for the 50-move rule?

What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?\nHow much time do you spend on analyzing the game?\nAre there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?\n\nA: Game analysis is important (both your own &amp; other people's games).\nI usually use some computer software-I am not great analysing only from a game scoresheet.\n(if so I would try &amp; make sure I had a board setup in front of me-but the computer chess software is very handy).\nI have Fritz9 / Winboard / BabasChess and a variety of chess engines. I usually use these for my game analysis.\nIt can also be very helpful to have a chess coach or other good player look over the game with you to get another opinion.\nGame analysis to start with is not easy but like most skills you can get better at it with practice and it can help you learn from your mistakes and successes-good luck with your chess analysis! :-)\n\nA: I think that the point in analysing your games is to point out in what conditions you are inclined to make a mistake (not necessarily a blunder, but also a sub-optimal move).\nYou do not study your games to improve your chess knowledge (for that you have to study Grand Masters games), but to improve your approach to the game.\nTry to determine common situations in your games, give them a name and try to find a kind of behaviour to tackle them.\nJust an example:\nUnexpected move: this is when your opponent made a move you did not expect and you notice that you lost confidence and you made a suicidal move to find counterplay. \nThen in your analysis you find out that your position was not lost at all!\nIt was you that reacted badly in that kind of situation. Take note of it.\nThe next time this situation arises, try to stay calm and be aware that usually a mistake is followed by a worst one in order to avoid it.\nThere are hundreds of situations like this that you have to find out yourself.\nCreate your kind of chess theory if you want to improve.\n\nA: I would focus on the \&quot;turning points\&quot; of the game. That is, I had a good game until I made move X. If, instead, I had made move Y or Z at that point, what would have been the result? \nThe idea is to discover your mistakes, first the most obvious ones, then the less obvious, and try to avoid them in future games.\n\nA: Engine analysis can take care of the tactical bloopers, it is usually the strategic plans and more human stuff that is hard to figure out even for strong players, and Andrew's advice should help in that regard. \nAbout the openings however, I believe it was Edmar Mednis who mentioned that 50% of the time should be spent studying openings, and it is not just about memorizing lines but also about the associated motifs extending to the middlegame and possibly into the endgame for openings like the Spanish Exchange and Berlin. Examining opening moves with only an engine can be tricky as the playable candidate moves usually do not differ beyond one-third of a pawn (or roughly thirty centipawns) or even up to half a pawn, which means almost nothing to a human player. Cross checking the main lines with books and games between strong players is definitely more important here.\n\nA: Analyzing your own games is the best and fastest way to improve in my opinion.  \nAs soon as possible after the game, write down the variations that you were thinking about during the game, especially the ones that were not played.  This will be useful when you come back to the game after days, months, or even years.  As you improve, it will be helpful to see what you were thinking during the game.  That way, you can pinpoint how you can improve your thought process in future games.\nWhen you start analyzing, use a chess board, but don't use an engine at first.  Look for moves where you made a mistake or missed something important.  If you lost material, go back and find the moment where you blundered.  If you got into a bad position, try to identify the moves that led to that position and evaluate some alternatives.  Put everything you come up with into your chess program/database (you are using some kind of a database, right?).\nAfter you've gone over the game \&quot;by hand\&quot; (this should take at least half an hour for a slow game, even more time if it was a complicated position), now it's time to use a chess engine.  Go through all of the moves and take note of where the engine says that you either made a poor move or missed an opportunity for a better move.  Again, add variations to your database.  If it's not clear why something that the engine suggests is good, investigate it further.  Try out some lines and see what the engine says.  \nAt this point, you have an awful lot of moves in front of you.  Now it's time to try to take away some lessons from the game.  Go back through the game again and decide what specific thing you could have done better.  Did you make a very poor positional move?  Did you blunder material?  Did you neglect development?  Did you put a piece on a bad square?  Asking questions like this will help you in future games during the game.  \nThe last thing that you can do is to ask a stronger player for help.  Bring all of the information you have to the stronger player and then go through the game once more.  The stronger player can give you suggestions for how to think in certain positions.  Basically, a chess engine can tell you what the right move is, but a stronger player is often needed to tell you why a move is correct.  \nYou should try to develop your own analysis style as well.  If you are a strong tactical player, try to go through the game without making moves on the board, just analyze in your head.  If you are good at endgames, switch colors and analyze where your opponent went astray in the endgame.  Hopefully analyzing games is fun and not a chore!\n\nAdditional thoughts\nI didn't mention studying the opening moves because that is less important than finding the specific points in the game where you made a mistake.  After you have looked at the game as a whole, studying the opening can often help you as well.  The best way to do this is to look for grandmaster games in the same opening that was played.  Find out what moves are commonly played, and then go through some games of stronger players in order to find good, general plans for the opening.  Try to see where you varied from these plans and determine why you didn't do what the stronger player did.  This is much more important than memorizing moves (although you will probably find that you've memorized many variations just as a matter of course!).\n\nQ: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?\nHow much time do you spend on analyzing the game?\nAre there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?\n\nA: Here are my 2 cents in addition to the already well-written answers:\nStart your analysis during your games instead of after. It really helps remember the critical points of the game rather than trying to recall them later (you're likely to not immediately start analyzing your game after a round finishes...). This will save you both time and effort. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark moves where you took more time than usual (Do the same for your opponent's moves!).\n\n*Mark the point where you got out of opening theory (that you knew at that point), and check later with an opening database whether you played the next few moves accurately.\n\n*Mark the point where you got out of your comfort zone (when did the complications begin? when did your opponent sac a piece on you? etc.).\n\n*Refrain from giving ?s and !s on the scoresheet during your game (unless you want to use it as a psychological tactic against your opponent).\n\n*If there was a time when you wanted to attempt a tactical shot, but didn't; mark it as well, so that you can check later for its soundness. (I use an inverted \&quot;T\&quot; (for Tal) to mark such moves :P )\nDoing this takes little time, and saves a LOT of time during post game analysis. Good luck!\n\nA: The goal of analyzing a game is to understand what happened in the game, step by step. Following Kasparov's advice, you should analyze all your games, regardless of the final result (loss, draw or win). The point is that it is tempting to only analyze your losses, because you think that these are the games that reveal your weak spots. While in reality, your wins could be covering up some even more serious flaws that will continue haunting your future games.\nNowadays, analysis involves the usage of a chess engine. The ideal analysis is as follows. First, you analyze with your opponent after the game. You go through the whole game and find the critical moments and share your thoughts about these positions. Taking a few notes during this process is a very good idea. Next, you get home and enter the game in your personal database over your games on the computer. Then, you step through the game with an engine (e.g. Rybka) running to find the key moments by looking at evaluation jumps. You compare these with the moments you discussed with your opponent, to check your own understanding. You can make notes and include them in the game file. Done!\n\nQ: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?\nHow much time do you spend on analyzing the game?\nAre there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?\n\nA: All analysis (as Gaul) is divided into three parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*During and immediately after the game\n\n*Annotation after the game\n\n*Computer engine checking\n\n\nStep one has been covered fairly well by the above posters, but to reiterate:\n\n\n*As you write the moves, mark moves which took you a long time to make\n\n*If you have space/time write down any variations you are considering\n\n*Write down any moves of your opponent which you feared (especially if they weren't played)\n\n*Always do a post-mortem (preferably with your opponent, or even better, a stronger player) and do it ASAP; write down any new ideas/variations\n\nStep two was also fairly covered but for the sake of being thorough, involves going over your variations and all the work you did during the game, looking for mistakes. \n\n\n*Look at positions where you took a long time and see if you can justify the time taken for the move made.\n\n*If you spot tactical combinations which you missed in the game, save the position as FEN (explained below). \n\n*Look up the opening and if possible, look at middlegame plans for that opening (if you can't find it in a book, look at GM games and try to extrapolate).\n\n*Focus on the things that caused you to lose and then learn the info necessary to cure that weakness (e.g you lost a drawn R vs P endgame, learn that endgame; you fell into an opening trap, learn that opening etc.)\n\nStep three is where I think some of the advice falls short. \n\n\n*Computers should not be used to analyze the game, they should be used to analyze your annotations. \n\nEssentially the computer is a purely objective machine, if you use it to analyze games it may give you crazy variations which are objectively good but which have you sweating buckets. Instead, you use the computer make sure your analysis is objective (i.e, free of calculation errors, bias, etc.). When the computer analyzes the game you should only use that information to supplement your existing analyses (not replace it). \n\n\n*One other thing that can be done with computers that hasn't been mentioned is playing \&quot;won\&quot; positions (from your games) against the engine. Do it from increasingly smaller margins of victory (up a whole piece, the exchange, two pawns, 1 pawn, 1/2 pawn) and watch as your ability to the convert the point becomes GM-level\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add a few things:\n\n\n*The reason you save the missed tactics as a FEN string is to create an Anki flashcard of that position for subsequent review and memorization. Anki is an extremely powerful tool for drilling those tactics and positions you want to completely memorize\n\n*Don't forget the point of analysis which is to improve your understanding of the game. Make sure that you have a list of conclusions/\&quot;things learned\&quot; from every game that you analyze. It seems kind of trivial, but having such things in writing makes them that much more concrete\n\n\nA: I'd have to disagree with @andrew about analyzing ones' own games.  The reason is, I'm a B-player. I make B-player moves. I perform B-player analysis. That's insufficient. Spending precious time to produce weak analysis is inefficient.\nThis may offend people.  But consider - if you had to make a home repair and you didn't know how, would you just figure it out on the spot or would you seek an expert/education to make you smarter? If you needed to shingle your roof, would you just get up there and start hammering? Or would you refer to several how-tos and learn a little first?  Maybe you'd talk to your brother-in-law who's a contractor?\nInstead, I start with the engine, on a setting that I cannot beat.  This is analogous to have an instructor or how-to book.\nI key the game into the engine and let it analyze each move (both sides.) If the computer produces a move and the score deviates too much (for me, a half a point), I stop to determine why the computer chooses a different move.  Then I work to understand how the computer's move prevents situation the caused by my move.\n\nA: in principle you should look at the game yourself without a computer, then go over with coach, then with computer.\nFor real life :\nA. enter the game into computer without engine straight after game, write down all the things you saw and thought that you can remember.\nB.enter the game into lichess.org, tell it to auto analyse. cover up the engine's suggestions by pressing one of the menu options on the right hand side.\nPress your mouse on the spot on the graph (see image) just before each big turning point (aka blunder) and solve as a puzzle!\n\nA is optional if you are really lazy :)\n\nQ: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?\nHow much time do you spend on analyzing the game?\nAre there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?\n\nA: You have to have a certain degree of ability before you gain a lot from analysing your own games.\nCertain points you can discover by yourself, but is it just a move or two, or is your whole plan bad? Often you'll not be able to answer that on your own. You can guess, but your guess isn't likely to be that much more reliable than your play in the original game. You'll learn from your own games faster if you find a stronger player to look at them with you.\nIf you can't do that and have to do it on your own, here's a suggested program:\nPlay through the game, observing it like a movie. Don't launch yourself into deep thinks. On this pass you're only looking for obvious tactical blunders, so spend only a couple of seconds looking for ways you could have lost or won material. Note them down somewhere for further analysis later. Reset the board.\nPlay through the game again, five moves at a time. Every five moves stop and ask yourself which side is better, if any. Mark that evaluation on the sheet. Watch, and when that evaluation changes, somebody made a mistake; go back and look through those five moves to see if you can find it. Maybe you can't, but if you can (and you've found it only if you find an alternative that maintains the evaluation) circle the move that caused the change.\nOnly after that should you fire up a computer to look at the game. Right now, you're checking your own conclusions against the computer. Walk the computer through the game, comparing its evaluations with your own. If they're different, spend 10 minutes or less finding out why (it's rarely productive to spend more than 10 minutes on things like this). If you can't, mark it and go on.\nWhat you're looking for here is whether your evaluations agree with the machine, and most especially if you and the machine pick the same \&quot;turning points\&quot; in the game. You're trying to correct your thinking here, train yourself to evaluate positions better.\nIf, after the end of this exercise you still don't understand the computer's evaluations of some positions, set the position up and play 5-10 games against the computer, starting from that position and taking first one side and then the other from that position and see what happens. Let the computer show you what it sees, and try your ideas against it. Learn to implement the ideas and evaluations you're learning.\nBut seriously, the best training games to analyse are games by players a couple of classes higher than you. If you're a C/D player, Carlsen's games aren't going to do you a lot of good; that's like a a guitarist that can manage three chords trying to learn from listening to Segovia; improvement is possible, but not all that likely. A D player can much more readily understand how to play like a B player than like a Grandmaster; it's like steps in a stairway.\n\nA: This platform Chess.com has what you are looking for. Each games can be reviewed at your own pace with/without comments.

Once I encountered an opponent who used a very early a6 in his Sicilian Opening. 
[FEN ""]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6

What could have been his objective with this move and how should I have have countered it?

A: The point of ...a6 is to control the square b5 where white can otherwise place a knight or bishop at some point. Another point is to prepare b7-b5 followed by Bc8-b7 and perhaps b5-b4 to chase a white Nc3. The move ...a6 appears in at least two variations, 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6; 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6. If you have ever been interested in the gambit 1.e4 c5 2.b4, then you can consider 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 3.b4.
[FEN ""]
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 3.b4 cxb4 4.a3 bxa3 5.Bxa3


A: This is called the O'Kelly variation of the Sicilian.
If white plays normally (i.e. 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3), then black can eventually kick the d4 knight with ...e5 when the knight doesn't have any great squares.  In this case, 2... a6 keeps the knight from moving to the natural b5 square (as in the Sveshnikov Sicilian).  This will allow black to quickly play ...d5 with equality.
White's best plan is to play either c3 or c4 trying to prove that black's move 2... a6 is not a good developing move.  When white plays c3, the natural plan is to follow up with d4, and then if black plays ...cxd4, white will respond with cxd4, gaining a classical pawn center.  When white plays c4 instead, white's plan is to set up a Maroczy bind.
An unambitious plan for white would be to play into a closed Sicilian - in the closed Sicilian, black frequently plays a6-b5 in order to get counterplay on the queenside.  Furthermore, in the closed Sicilian, tempi matter a lot less because the position will not change radically from one move to the next.

A: As I understand it, the purpose of 2... a6 is to keep a white piece (usually knight or bishop) off b5.
It seems premature, because white might not want to go there anyway (for some time). Meaning that it could easily become a wasted move.
As White, I would concentrate on king side development, knowing that b5 was "off limits," but not caring, because I have "better" things to do.
One disadvantage of a6 is that Black may want to play a5 later to try to "chase" a White knight on b3. But if he does so, he would have wasted a move with a6. As White, I might try to "transpose" into that variation so that Black has wasted a move.

A: a6 serves three purpose .


*

*It is a waiting move in Sicilian as like Black waits for White's Plan . 

*It is the start of Q-Side Counter Play from black . As in Sicilian Black generally plays on the Center &amp; Q-side .

*Generally in Sicilian the Black Queen's favourite Square is c7 . You may see this move in Kan/Taimanov/Najdorf etc . When Black Plays a6 then it covers the b5 Square which prevents White's Knight to come to b5 and attack the c7 Queen which costs a Tempo to Black .

Handicapping is routine in the Japanese game Go (my best game). The basic strength unit is one stone, and a one-stone difference represents a full level of difference in strength.
I (about a 1500 player) once asked a 2100 player how much of a handicap she would need to give me so that we would have an equal chance to win. "Probably a knight, maybe more," she answered. I once took a knight handicap against a 2200 player and lost, but it was a much tighter, closer game than one with no handicap.
That might suggest that a pawn is equivalent to about 200 points of rating. Apparently handicapping doesn't do much for say, a 50 point difference in strength (you just play and take your chances). But above that, there might be ways to use handicaps. Even giving someone the first move two times out of three (as was earlier done in professional Go) might do something.
Or would it? Why hasn't handicapping been done much formally in chess, as in Go?

A: For my niece and nephew (ages 5 and 7), I started spotting them four pieces of their choice ( minus K or Q) and each time they win the number decreases by one. We started by switching sides when things were going my way.

A: I have been handicapping student games for over 15 years, and my two favourites, if the relative strengths allow, are these:
1)  White replaces queen with rook (about 4 points) -OR-
2)  White replaces queen with bishop (about 6 points).
Black, the handicap receiver, does not have a numerical advantage in pieces.  Both handicaps are strictly worse than the standard even strength situation.  The players do not need to know how to use chess clocks.  Extremely easy to explain.  Handicapping the queen will always impact the game, unlike for example removing a rook.  Doesn't mess up many of the openings as much as removing a knight.  
Another handicap that is popular with the kids, and even easier to implement now that many sets come with extra queens, is to power up the weaker player by replacing a piece with the spare queen--usually the QR or the KB.  This one is also nice when giving a simultaneous, because you don't need a stock of spare rooks and bishops.
Ultimately, every chess coach has to ask himself or herself whether handicapping will benefit the club and the students.  A large club with many students at each level may not need to.  My school clubs have not had this luxury; regularly handicapping the stronger players does increase the staying power of the weaker players, and I haven't faced much protest from the stronger players either.
Anyone else using a system similar to mine out there?

A: Handicapping changes chess in a fundamental way that stones in go do not.  
In go, getting an extra stone is roughly equivalent to having an extra move.  In chess, losing a piece is catastrophic, and in a game between two players that are within ~300 rating points, losing a piece means loss of the game.  
One other reason that handicapping is not done this way is that while you (1500 player) might lose to a 2200 player (barely) without a knight, it is highly unlikely that a 2000 player would lose to a 2700 player at a tournament time control.  
Handicapping was done before rating systems became so prevalent.  In clubs, players would be said to be "knight players" meaning that they needed odds of a knight in order to give a stronger opponent a good game.  Similarly there were "pawn" players and "rook" players.
An easier handicap between two roughly equal opponents would be to give the weaker player white.  This is roughly equal to 25-40 rating points [1].  Another common handicap is for the stronger player to play "blindfolded", meaning that he or she cannot look at the board, but has to call out the moves in order to play.

A: For "fun" games with players of different strengths you can use a chess clock and give the weaker player more time. This allows me to play against my son who is just learning a reasonable chance at winning. We often play where he gets 5 minutes on the clock to my 2 minutes.

A: While giving an opponent the odds of a pawn or a knight might be fun to make the winning chances more distributed, it is by no means an exact method. I remember the exciting handicap match between Kasparov and Chapman. Kasparov won 2.5:1.5 by giving the odds of 2 pawns against an opponent of approx. 450 Elo points less. Since the 2 pawns given changed for each game, not all games were equally difficult for Kasparov. During an interview the former world champion said he feared the game most where he had to let go of the king's center pawn. So a pawn is not a pawn. And if I remember correctly he added that a two pawn disadvantage was much more than double a one pawn disadvantage.
Hence I believe you can't construct a meaningful metric system of which handicap is worth how many points.

Q: Is there a way to use handicaps in chess to bridge the gap between players of different skill levels? Handicapping is routine in the Japanese game Go (my best game). The basic strength unit is one stone, and a one-stone difference represents a full level of difference in strength.

But above that, there might be ways to use handicaps. Even giving someone the first move two times out of three (as was earlier done in professional Go) might do something.
Or would it? Why hasn't handicapping been done much formally in chess, as in Go?

A: Usually, handicaps in Go are used between a weaker and a stronger opponent to make the game more competitive, giving the weaker player more opportunities to attack and defend as would happen in an even game. This is done in turn to avoid the game from becoming a sweep by the stronger player, with the weaker player constantly fumbling defenses. The true underlying purpose of handicapping should be seen as accelerating the learning of the weaker player as opposed to making the game more enjoyable for the weaker player. If the latter is what the player wants, he should seek play with players of equal ability.
As described in Andrew's answer, unfortunately, there is no clear way to handicap a game of chess as there is in go. However, if the goal is to use handicapping as a means to accelerate learning chess between a tutor and a student, a common thing to do is to play a normal game of chess, and upon encountering a situation where the weaker player thinks he has a losing position a switch of sides is done upon request of the weaker player: the weaker player becomes the attacker, the stronger player becomes the defender. 
From personal experience, a stronger player is a better chess player not because they have some magic ability, but because they see more possibilities and understand the variations better. In this sense, the stronger player is usually able to recover the weaker player's poor position (especially given the rating discrepancy between attacker and defender) making this a very instructive and hands on learning process. As a side effect, the weaker player is given the chance to practice executing attacks correctly.
Obviously for this to work, both parties must agree that winning and losing doesn't mean much, and it is simply play for the enjoyment of the game and to accelerate the weaker player's understanding.

A: In some ways, the rating system is the handicap.  It's very similar to the odds given to less impressive horses in racing, or the less favored boxer.
If you over-perform based upon you and your opponents respective ratings, you'll have a net gain of points, even if you don't win many (any?) games.
I drew a master once and sheared him of many points.  When he beat me at another match, he got like 1 or 2 points because according to the his rating it was expected.
edit, for the comment:
No, I understand the OP completely. The opponents one is paired with are based upon rating. When one's rating drops (or rises), one is paired with players in a similar skill level range. So the "handicap" is not having to play brutally better players as often.  There isn't a practical way to handicap individual games in chess like there is in Shogi.
At low skill levels, players drop pieces so any sort of handicap would be pointless. Even at my cruddy level, a single pawn adds 200 or 300 rating points, and a piece would add 500 or more. There simply isn't a lot of granularity in chess handicaps.

A: I play against kids at my high school, and they're terrible. I can handicap a queen and both rooks, but usually I still win. When you're playing against low-skill players, handicaps don't matter much.

A: Like some people have mentioned in the thread, both time and piece handicaps are popular in chess.  You also can do "wager" handicaps if you're playing for cash or play-money currency.  
There are several chess websites that now offer handicapping to help bridge the often vast skill-level differences in chess.  Out of all of them I recommend:
http://www.velocitychess.com
This site allows ANY combination of piece, cash, and wager handicap.  For example, as a USCF master, I may offer a weaker player an extra starting knight, his 5 minutes to my 1 minute, and 3:1 wager odds in his favor for a game.  It is a lot of fun!

Or would it? Why hasn't handicapping been done much formally in chess, as in Go?

A: Besides pieces, you can also give free moves, but both change the game. Playing while down a queen isn't about how well you can play chess, it's about how well you can predict your opponent's moves. Good chess is about making moves that are good no matter what your opponent does, not about correctly guessing what blunder your opponent will make. This is similar to how in games in general, there's only so much that a handicap can make up for bad AI.
Something that changes the game less is to give one player more time, but the problem with that is that there's a limit to how much advantage that gives: at some point, the weaker is taking so much time that the stronger player is simply using the weaker player's move to think. If the stronger player can think through two half-moves in less time that it takes the weaker player to think through one half-move, then giving the weaker player more time just helps the stronger player. This effect can be reduced by having two or more weaker players play the stronger player simultaneously. Playing blindfolded can also be a handicap, but how much this hurts a player varies.
Another variant, that is similar to ldog's suggestion:
The weaker may, when making a move, call out a positive integer. If they have not done so before, it is optional, but once they call out a number, all further moves must be accompanied by a positive integer less than the previous one. If this is not possible (i.e., the previous number was 1), and the move is not checkmate, they lose. 
Until the stronger player calls out a number, the weaker can switch sides/colors freely. Once the stronger calls out a number, the weaker player can switch sides at any time, but this switch is permanent, and the weaker player now has that many turns to deliver checkmate.

I've started playing blitz/bullet (fast) games and felt like I was getting moderately good at it (1 - 10mn games), but then I switched to correspondence chess (1 - 5 days/move) and it seems to me that it was affecting my fast games skills.
Does correspondence chess really require a different set of skills than fast chess? Do you have any advice that may help getting the best of both type of games?

A: It really depends more on your personal level of strength for how play proceeds during each of these types of chess, however in general the same strengths and ideas are applicable to both. The difference in your blitz strength and correspondence strength can be for a number of different reasons. Perhaps you can assess and analyze quickly, or you don't spend as much time as your opponent analyzing during correspondence.
The time control does not dictate whether it will be a "strategical" or "tactical" battle, but instead the choice of openings and player's styles.

A: While the two are vastly different, if you improve at one, you will most likely also improve at the other.
Tactics are far more important to get right in correspondence chess.  The slightest misstep will be punished by your opponent simply because they have all the time they need to analyze all of the variations, and they can also use at least a board to assist them, and in some cases, even a chess engine.  
In blitz chess, while attacks frequently win the game, unsound moves are not always refuted.  This means that if you are able to launch an attack, even at the cost of a piece, your opponent will most likely be forced to burn time in order to avoid mate, and this will give you an advantage on the clock.  
In terms of long term planning, in correspondence chess, assuming a high level game where tactical blunders will not determine the result, plans become incredibly important.  A correspondence game is frequently a battle between two plans while in blitz chess, tactics and the clock rule the day.
So overall, correspondence chess is a much higher quality game.  Blitz chess is fun and quick (so you can play a lot more games), but in terms of getting better at chess, blitz won't really help you.  If you want to improve at blitz, practice tactics and play more blitz!

A: This skills required for blitz are the opposite of those for correspondence. So I suggest that you concentrate on one or the other, but not both. Unless you're an insanely good mental juggler.
"Blitz" places a premium on tactical skills. Also, seeing things faster than your opponent.
"Correspondence" places a premium on strategical skills. Looking many moves ahead, and seeing deeper than your opponent. Because you can both play through the various permutations from a given position at home.

Let's say I have only the King left.
I've read several rules and posts of people saying there is a limit to the number of moves your opponent has to check mate you in, but there are some inconsistencies:


*I found the number of moves varying depending on where I found the info. It seems to be 50, but I am not 100% sure.

*It seems there are some exceptions and cases where the count is reset, but the information seems quite spread all over.

I'd like to understand this rule in detail and know all the special cases if possible, as it seems way too fuzzy for me and the people I play with.

A: By the "rules" of chess, 50 moves without captures or pawn moves will result in a draw. When the ONLY pieces left on the board are two kings, a draw occurs. You can also ask the other player for a draw ("I offer a draw").  Threefold repetition of a position will also result in a draw. 

A: There is no rule about a number of moves that applies only when one side has a king. So the real answer to your question is, there's no such thing.
However, there is a rule that states that if 50 or more moves (full moves, so 50 by white and 50 by black) have happened without a pawn move or capture, the player to move may claim a draw. It's not necessary that one of the sides has a lone king for that.

A: If a player has a theoretical win, that person has a move limit (50 moves) with "no fundamental alteration of the position." That means no captures of pawns or pieces, and no pawn moves. The count is reset if either of these things happens.
There used to be an  exception for positions like king, bishop, and knight vs. King (a checkmate). It was known to be winnable in a maximum of 34 moves. But players got twice this maximum, or 68 moves (Milton Hanauer, "Chess Made Simple"). Apparently, this, and other exceptions, were removed later, according to a comment below.

A: 
For the most part, a draw occurs when it appears that neither side will win.
Draws are codified by various rules of chess including stalemate
  (when the player to move has no legal move and is not in check),
  threefold repetition (when the same position occurs three times with
  the same player to move), and the fifty-move rule (when the last fifty
  successive moves made by both players contain no capture or pawn
  move). 
A draw also occurs when neither player has sufficient material
  to checkmate the opponent or when no sequence of legal moves can lead
  to checkmate.
      Unless specific tournament rules forbid it, players may agree to a draw at any time. 
Ethical considerations may make a draw uncustomary
  in situations where at least one player has a reasonable chance of
  winning. 
For example, a draw could be called after a move or two, but
  this would likely be thought unsporting.

A: I know you mainly asked about the 50 move rule, and that has already been answered, but I thought I'd answer the exact question as stated which was "With the King as the last piece, how can you get a draw?"


*

*Both players can agree to a draw

*Opponent Stalemates you (you have no legal moves, but are not in check)

*You stalemate your opponent (yes you can do this with just a king, but he has to help you by blocking himself with a pawn for example)

*Your opponent does not have mating material (no pawns and one, Knight or Bishop, or less)

*50-move rule. After 50 moves have passed without a capture or a pawn advancing, you can claim a draw.

*The same position is repeated 3 times and you claim a draw. For the position to be the same it must be the same players turn and the same set of possible legal moves (including castling rights and en passant opportunities). The position need not repeat 3 times back to back, but at any time.

*Your opponent runs out of time on the clock in a timed game and you claim it. The game is drawn because you do not have mating material.

Nc3, and went on to win. I've never seen another game that did not open with a pawn. Does a knight opening have any inherent weaknesses? Was it ever popular?

A: 1. Nc3 is not a bad move. It is not a "favorite" move because it doesn't open up lines for a queen and bishop like 1. d4 or 1. e4. But you haven't ruled out these possibilities or otherwise wasted a moved.
1. Nf3 is preferred to 1. Nc3. One, because you've moved your knight for early king side castling, and 2) because it deters Black ...e5 (...d5 would be protected by the queen). But 1. Nc3 does support a later e4.
The advantage of 1. Nc3 is that it is a "quiet" move that allows you to "transpose" into other openings, such as the King's Indian Attack or the Vienna Game. But you retain the option, for a move or two, of WHICH of these other openings. It looks "harmless" but isn't. If Black disregards it, he could be in for a nasty surprise. 

A: At the highest level of play, grandmasters such as Kramnik essay 1. Nf3 on a frequent basis, and there are complete systems built around it. It also takes care of nuances such as allowing them to sidestep undesirable or unfavourable lines/openings that arise out of normal d4 systems, like the Nimzo-Indian or specific lines in the QGD/KID, or even the English opening.
Note that although it is technically known as the Reti Opening, it is seldom played for the purpose of getting into one, but for the transposition possibilities as mentioned above.

A: The King's Indian Attack can also be played starting with 1. Nf3 and is widely played among amateurs and pros.

A: Just to add to what James and Soufiane have already added, and to specifically hit on your question about knight openings having weaknesses: this particular knight opening has the weakness of allowing Black control of the center. Nf3 does not have that same weakness.

A: Knight openings are common for my opponents. I've found that knight openings can result in quite strong formations later in the game. So among more casual games, knight openings are semi-common and have some advantages. 

A: As some have already said, the move 1. Nc3 has the drawback ot blocking the c-pawn, which is often pushed in closed games.
Also, Black has the very concrete move 1... d5 that threatens 2... d4 and asks a serious question to White:


*should I prevent ...d4 by playing 2. d4 myself ? This is possible, but in this case why not playing 1. d4  2. Nc3 that is probably more flexible

*Or do I accept or even provoke 2... d4, trying to counter-attack on Black's big pawn center later on ? The game can typically continue with 1. Nc3 d5 2. e4 d4 3. Nce2 etc

In this opening Black has the upper hand in the center:

And usually White tries to attack on the Kingside with plans like Nh4 followed by f4.

I discuss this opening and other ones as well in the following video, if you are interested to know more: https://youtu.be/A-0EiR8b0Gk

A: While not 1. Nc3, the Reti Opening (1. Nf3) is still today one of the most popular openings for white. It has frequent play at amateur and master levels and scores well for both.
The opening 1. Nc3 is called the Dunst Opening and is seen much less often. There's a good breakdown of thoughts on the Reti and the Dunst openings over at Wikipedia.

A: The opening starting with 1. Nb1-c3 (long algebraic notation) or 1. Nc3 (short algebraic notation) is called "Van Geet Opening". It is in fact very rare to see this opening being played by either professional players or by amateurs who study the game seriously. White's c pawn gets blocked by the knight with this move, and this might be the reason why pros don't use it very often.
On the other hand, Mikhail Chigorin (1850-1908), a strong Russian player from the 1800's played a similar move with the black pieces: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 and the opening got his name (Chigorin's Defense).
Some opening manuals feature a few paragraphs on these openings (Van Geet Opening and Chigorin Defense) like, for example, FCO (Fundamental Chess Openings by Paul Van der Sterren), Chess Opening Essentials Vol. 2 and Vol. 4, among many others.

Q: Opening with knight I recently came across a game purportedly played by Napoleon (white) where he opened with 1. Nc3, and went on to win. I've never seen another game that did not open with a pawn. Does a knight opening have any inherent weaknesses? Was it ever popular?

A: 1. Nc3 is not often seen because it blocks the c pawn.  In many openings, white wants to push the c pawn to either c3 or c4 in order to help control the center.  With the knight already on c3, this will take an extra two tempi.  
1. Nf3, the Reti, is more common because pushing the f pawn weakens the king's position.  Therefore, f3 and f4 are fairly rare, and it is a safe bet that the f pawn won't be moved until later in the game when the knight may well have moved from f3.  Furthermore, with 1. Nf3 white keeps his or her options open - white may play either d4, e4, or c4 at the appropriate moment.

We can open games in many ways (any of the pawns or knights) and then go ahead with different strategies. The queen being the most important piece, I would like to get it out in the field without compromising the security of the king and using a minimum number of moves. Which types of opening and/or moves would facilitate this? Also provide any pros and cons to your strategy.

A: Bringing out the queen in the opening is in general not the correct decision. The point is that usually the other side will often be able to develop their pieces to attack the queen and gain tempi.
However, if you still feel inclined to bring out the queen early, the only opening with a sound reputation I can recommend is the Scandinavian (1. e4 d5) as black, and after the usual 2. exd5 Qxd5 your queen is out. Be prepared for Nc3 and other moves that attack your queen, gaining your opponent a tempo, and allowing him to develop quickly. 

A: If you play Black, Qxd5 Variation of the Scandinavian Defence is something that comes to mind...
[FEN ""]
1. e4 d5 
2. exd5 Qxd5


A: One common opening playable against most mere mortals is the Scandanivian:  
[FEN ""]
1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5

This brings the queen out early, but white often plays his bishop to d2 and later attacks the queen here (often by moving a later knight placed on Nc3, giving a discovered attack).
Regardless, this opening is playable in spite of the early queen sortie, not because of it.  It's often used as an example of what not to do, but in this case isn't completely illogical.

A: The best way I can think of "free" my queen is to play an opening in which two or three pairs of minor pieces or pawns were quickly exchanged. 
There is a danger of a queen being trapped on a "cluttered" board, and being forced to exchange herself for one or two minor pieces. Once a few of these are gone, the queen has a much freer scope over the board, in combination with rooks (occasionally with one of the remaining bishops).

A: Generally speaking, the queen likes open lines and lots of manoevering space, because she has long-range attack capabilities and being far away can't be targeted as easily by minor pieces. So if you enjoy playing the queen early despite all the dangers involved you should prefer openings that open lines quickly. Inbalanced positions with play on both sides of the board are preferable. Since the queen is an excellent attacking piece, look for gambits, too, because they usually aim at opening lines and sacrify material for speed of development, which is a must for a happy queen, since she usually needs support from at least another piece to work best. At example, look at the king's gambit or Latvian gambit.

A: As others pointed out bringing the queen into play early is a double edged sword. That said, there are several main lines doing this. 
Scandinavian was already mentioned. Then we have one Ponziani main line (although often the arguably weaker 3... Nf6 is played): 
[FEN ""]
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 d5 (3... Nf6) 4. Qa4

If you like to play aggressive, the Steinitz variation in the Scotch might be for you: 
[FEN ""]
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Qh4 

However be aware that you have a hard time if white doesn't cling to the pawn but attacks your weak spot c7 with the knight.
There are plenty of other choices (e.g. the Middle Gambit).

A: The right answer is "don't do it," but the straight answer – which might be less helpful – is that
1 e4 e5
2 Qh5

is the best way for White to get the Queen out early, if White is really determined to do so. It's goofy but at least forcing. Best play continues
2 ... Nc6
3 Bc4 g6
4 Qf3 Nf6

White has already squandered the initiative by this point, though; Black now threatens ...Nd4 with a big gain of time.
5 Ne2 =/=

Another suggestion is to play the Evans Gambit, where White's Qd1-b3 is often available. But unlike 2. Qh5, that depends on Black's response.

Q: What is the best way to free your queen as soon as possible? We can open games in many ways (any of the pawns or knights) and then go ahead with different strategies. The queen being the most important piece, I would like to get it out in the field without compromising the security of the king and using a minimum number of moves. Which types of opening and/or moves would facilitate this? Also provide any pros and cons to your strategy.

A: It is usually a good idea to NOT bring your queen out early. If you are not careful, you can lose tempo and development because your Queen will be chased around the board as your opponent continues to develop.

A: I don't think that getting your queen out early should be your goal in the opening.  Fighting for the center, developing your pieces, and king safety should be your priority.  That said, e-pawn openings are your best bet to open lines for your queen as soon as possible.  Look into the Ruy Lopez:
[FEN ""]
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5 ...

With regard to rooks, bishops and knights, might there be a a different inherent value whether on kingside or queenside? For instance, I've always found a greater value to kingside bishops because of their inherent nature of attacking the opposing king's squares before and after castling.
Has anyone seen any documented systems based on this idea? I'm not looking for speculation.

A: I don't think that there's any value to where the pieces start, but the value of the pieces changes drastically depending on where they are on the board at a given time.  
For example, a white knight on d6 that can't be exchanged off is usually considered to be worth a rook.  Similarly, if black has castled kingside with pawns on f7, g6, and h7, and white has an unopposed dark square bishop, that bishop can be worth a rook (at least) if white can attack the black king.  
The only pieces that are inherently different are the bishops (one light, one dark), but they're still equal until the pawn structure has been determined.  A bishop is usually strong when the opponent's pawns are on its color (so they can be attacked) and the friendly pawns are on the opposite color (so they don't get in the way).  

A: To the best of my understanding, in modern chess, the real values of pieces (or rather, the playing side as a whole) are largely dependent on the following factors: function (are they optimally poised to carry out particular goal(s)?), coordination between pieces (are they working together to fulfil multiple aims or getting into one another's way?), number of weaknesses inherent in the position (determined largely by pawn structure), tactics (although this can be explained by the earlier factors), and finally, the raw value of the individual pieces.
So the assignment of numeric values to individual pieces is relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things, at least for players who are past the point of giving away pawns or minor pieces for nothing. Those values only serve as a rough gauge (e.g. bishop and knight are comparable in terms of value, but not identical in that regard), among other factors to be considered for the proper assessment of any given position.

A: Pieces don't change value based on whether they are on the queen or kingside. They increase in value (based on placement) for other reasons. 
For instance, former world champion Capablanca said in "Chess Fundamentals" said that getting a rook on the seventh rank was well worth a sacrificed pawn, and his opponent would do well to draw, even with a pawn ahead. In this case, a rook, normally worth five points, is worth at least six. Capablanca also said that a passed pawn was sufficient to win a game (all other things being equal). So a passed pawn might be worth two points instead of one. Likwise, a knight in a "hole" at e4, e5, e6, or d4, d3, d6 would be worth more than usual, perhaps four points, rather than three. Most masters would say that a "bishop pair" in an open position against a bishop and knight, or two knights is worth least seven points, not six.

A: I don't think that there's a system to value pieces based on that.  As you get into the middle and endgame, the position dictates the relative value of the pieces and not the side that they started on.  Do a search on good knight vs. bad bishop.  Also take a look at Silman's books "How to Reassess your Chess" which discusses imbalances as a way of evaluating a position instead of a pure material assessment.

A: Other than the classical 9,5,3,3,1 valuation of the pieces, there are many more, as in this Wikipedia article.  But these still don't vary with the position of these pieces at the start or in later stages of the game.  However, most any computer chess engine will vary these values according to the position of the pieces.  
Even outside of computer chess, it's not unheard of for some to suggest that and a or h pawn is worth as little as 75% or even 50% of a pawn on the d or e files, and so on.  For example, one chess maxim says you should usually recapture with a pawn -towards the center-.

I'm looking for free software that automatically analyzes and annotates chess games (post-mortem), preferably marking blunders, suggesting good alternatives, pointing out missed tactics (forks, pins, skewers, removing the defender, etc.). Preferably it should also generate some printable output (e.g. PDF) so one could ruminate away from the computer, and in front of a chess board. What do you guys use for this?

A: BabasChess is free chess software (good for play on internet chess servers) that has automatic analysis with Crafty chess engine feature. It is somewhat basic but is useful and I think BabasChess is good as free software!

A: Arena Chess 3.5: Play/load your game then use menu option "Engines/Automatic Analysis". You can set time, depth of analysis, etc.


A: Lichess allows you to import a game in PGN and automatically generates computer analysis for it.

A: The best free chess software I've found is the Tarrasch Chess GUI. At the link you can DL the interface and a compatible engine of relatively strong strength. It provides a decent enough opening database, and will give you computer evaluations for each move. 

A: Most chess programs allow you to run an engine while you go through the moves of a game, and see the engine's evaluations.  This is sometimes called a Kibitzer, Infinite Analysis or just Analyze.  The program Chessbase and Tarrasch are examples of programs which do this.
Some programs can be set up to annotate, blundercheck or do a full game analysis.  In this, you set how long the engine will look at each move, and what degree of error it should comment on.  When it finishes its analysis, it shows you game notation marked with question marks and alternate lines.  The programs that do this are Aquarium, Arena, Babaschess, Chess Assistant, the engine GUIs sold by the company Chessbase (Fritz, Hiarcs, Houdini, Komodo, Rybka, Shredder), Chessmaster, Chesspartner, Hiarcs Chess Explorer, SCID, SCID vs PC and the Shredder GUI sold by shredderchess.com.  The engines Crafty and Yace also have an "annotate" feature.
On Windows, I use Chessbase, but I don't print anything out.  On my Android phone, I use Chess PGN Master Pro, and on my iPad, I'll probably end up going with Giordano Vicoli's Chess_Studio, for analyzing.

A: Having tried almost all known software and tools to analyze my games, 
decodechess.com gives a learning experience that's not seen anywhere else. It's more than just annotations of the style you were looking for, but actual explanations! Really cool stuff, worth trying and they run a generous free trial and are looking for feedback. 
Here's a screenshot of their cool tab system:


A: You can get a good free PGN Viewer app from
PGN ChessBook
which comes with the very strong Stockfish analysis engine built in. It has some good tools for analyzing games, as described on 
Automatic blunder check and game annotation features
The best annotated PGN game collections I could find were also added to my website at
Annotated PGN download page
It took me several days to find these. There are 950+ annotated games in “.pgn” files and I added every world championship match game ever played.

A: ChessBase will do what you're describing (enter the game, then tell it to annotate), but it is not free.
Scid is a free alternative database program, but it will not automatically annotate your game.
See this chess.com thread for more: Is there any free software to analyse the completed game?

A: Arena Chess
Arena is a free chess application that has a rich and stable feature set. It should do pretty much all you need to do - except generate PDFs (not sure what you mean by that)

A: Android app Analyze This Pro (there is a free version too) has a feature to annotate and even comment on games.

A: A friend made this: https://www.chesscompass.com/ I think it's what you are looking for?
Seems easy to use, and he's nice so I thought I'd try and promote it for him a bit.

A: I am surprised that no one has suggested Lucas Chess.
It's free and easy to use for analyzing your games, with customizable options for the analysis you want.
To analyze your game, you open your pgn file (tools/open or paste pgn) or create your own game (tools/create your own game) and then go to utilities/analysis/analyze. You can also play any alternative move after the analysis (as white or black) against any engine of your preference!
It also has many other features such as:
mate in 1,2,3 and 4, find best move, resistance training, tactics by repetition,
play like a grandmaster, determine your calculating power, a large choice of internal chess engines, graphical analysis, generating tactical positions from PGN files, move trees, personal opening guide, training openings and many others.

*parse PGNs and/or FENs

*calculate valid chess moves based on position

*process an entire chess game

EDIT:
Sorry, I should be more clear. I'm not looking for open source software, I'm looking for open source programming libraries.

A: Stockfish
Stockfish (website and github) is an open source and very strong UCI engine. As such it can do all you are asking for, but usually requires a GUI in order to do so. You can however access all functionality via a command prompt/shell as well.

A: Crafty
Crafty is a strong chess programm and can be used with Winboard, Xboard and Scid. So it is available for all major operating systems.
Scid
Scid can maintain databases of chess games, you can analyse (end) games.The software is available for all major operating systems.
Xboard
Xboard is a user interface to the Internet Chess Server. It uses the X Windows System, so I assume this runs only under GNU/Linux. Xboard can be used as a viewer and supports all forms of chess.

A: PyChess
Is a chess client built in Python. You can use it's chess logic libraries without much trouble.


*http://code.google.com/p/pychess/source/browse/utilities/arena.py

*http://code.google.com/p/pychess/source/browse/utilities/blunders.py

Are examples of how you you might use the libraries to control chess engines, but you can also use just the chess logic:
from pychess.Utils.Board import Board
from pychess.Utils.lutils.lmove import toSAN
from pychess.Utils.lutils.lmovegen import genAllMoves
board = Board(setup=True).board
for move in genAllMoves (board):
    print (toSAN (board, move)))

It's very fast, since it's used for the built in engine, and it has many advanced features such as parsing long list of SAN moves, generating check evasions and static exchange evaluation (SEE).

What are some of the best sites for online chess?
Free sites with friendly communities are better.

A: Chess.com is very popular and free. It also has a Facebook app that you can use to play. You can also play with a time limit of days/weeks and this is very useful if you rarely can find the time to sit down and have a serious game straight.

A: Red Hot Pawn has a great chess community and is available for free, or with a paid subscription.

A: Chess.com has become a hot spot, with live and correspondence chess, along with tactical problems, articles, etc.  The live chess is OK, but not the best. 
ICC or playchess are the best for live chess, FICS if you want free, but it doesn't have as many titled players or features.  Those sites will also have video's, live commentary of top level tournaments, and much more.

A: If you would like to play a lot of quick games, I would recommend FICS, or the Free Internet Chess Server.  Using a good interface like BabasChess or Winboard, it's response time is a lot crisper.  It has a long history with a lot of "culture", off-topic chat channels, 'bots', and a lot more master level players that some of the other sites.  
Chess.com is also a good option.

A: ChessCube
ChessCube has one of the nicest user interfaces, although it cannot be used with iPhone or iPads since it uses flash.

In the middle and the end of a chess game, there are visible consequences to almost every move you can make, there are more constraints limiting what is logical to move, and it is fairly straightforward to see what you did wrong when you analyze the game.
At the beginning of the game, it seems like there is a tremendous number of possible ways a game could progress--and not very many of the moves have any immediately tangible consequences. Because of this, I usually have no idea what I should do in the beginning of a game.
Are there any things I should be thinking about at the beginning? Up to date, I've just been moving pieces haphazardly until what I need to do becomes obvious.

A: Agree with @JaredDef's answer which covers the big ideas. Some more specific opening strategies for beginners can be found here:


*

*make your first move with the
pawn in front of either your King or Queen 

*make good developing moves, and generally develop your
Knights before your Bishops 

*try not to move the same piece twice in the opening 

*your King's safety is crucial; castle early if you can

*don't advance more than one or two pawns in the chess opening, and definitely not a pawns in front of your castled King

*when you develop your pieces, try to make moves which threaten something

*don't bring your Queen out early


A: Memorize three openings to several moves.  I recommend, as white, one opening, probably king-pawn opening.  Then memorize two openings as black so you can react your opponent's K- or Q- pawn openings.
For example, I prefer a King's Indian Defense to 1. d4, and the Caro-Kann Defence to 1. e4.
When playing white, I play a Queen's Gambit.
Memorize the most popular lines to 5 or 6 moves.  Then study them to find out why those moves are popular.
And to answer your question directly, you should be looking to take material or kill the guy's king, starting on move 1 (paraphrased from Bobby Fischer.)  Good piece development is a great start.

A: According to world champion Capablanca, in "Chess Fundamentals," your first priority is to get your pieces out as fast as you can. If White, you might take a detour to try to hinder black's development, in order to maintain your relative advantage; if Black, you need to find tactical ways to parry White's threats.
Otherwise, you should be looking to concentrate your pieces, particularly in areas left weak by your opponent. Did s/he leave parts of the board undeveloped or undefended to favor a few pieces? Then try to find a way to take advantage of that fact. Perhaps the opposing king is inadequately protected, and can be attacked. If not, your opponent may have started an a attack prematurely and left the so-called "center" (of the board) insufficiently guarded. If so, a successful center counterattack will stop most attacks. 

A: 

*Develop your pieces, not Pawns

*Try not to move the same piece more than once in an opening unless

*you really need to. Gain control of the center Castle your king

*Develop/Connect your rooks Don't move too fast or you will blunder.

*Take your time and view the whole board.


A: There are a few regular things you should fight for out of the opening


*Control of the center

*Development of pieces

*Early castle

*Space

So basically you want to get as many pieces out as quickly as possible, while attempting to control the center (the four middle squares and to a lesser extent the next ring of 12 squares). While not all opening strategies revolve strictly around these principles, it is found in the majority of games and especially good rules to play by when starting out.
EDIT: Keep in mind these are not all rigid rules. I would also like to respectfully disagree with Tony. When starting out, memorizing openings is the very last thing you want to do. Feel free to look through an openings book (The first, and very amazing, book on openings that I read) or database. However do not seek just to memorize and spit out moves until you reach a position you haven't actually thought about.

A: Say "no" to memorizing openings. Say "yes" to playing based on opening principles. Say "yes" to trial-by-fire - you learn more. Every game is an opportunity to learn something. If you get rolled in the opening, find out how you can improve your play in that line and learn it - don't memorize variations just for the sake of it. Waste of time at levels of chess below Cat A, IMHO.
You can find a list of basic opening principles freely on the net. Or, go to Chess.com and take some of the free beginner courses. Right up your alley.

Q: What strategies should I be thinking about at the beginning of the game?

Sometimes I end up getting the opportunity to play a friendly game with someone who has played a lot more chess than I have; these games seem more fun and interesting for everyone (and I seem to end up with a better chance of winning) when I can push play away from common positions without incurring a big early disadvantage. Are there openings that I can study to accomplish that more dependably?

A: Gambits are often a good way to get your opponent out of their comfort zone.  As white, some good gambits include:


*the Morra Gambit

*the Evans Gambit

*4. Ng5 in the Two Knight's Defense (black is sacrificing a pawn here though!)

For black, the Sicilian and the King's Indian are good ways to create a double edged game.  A line that you know by heart in the Sicilian is probably your best bet.  Against d4 you can consider playing an early ...c5 with the Benko Gambit or the Benoni - both of which can lead to an unbalanced game as well.  White probably has a fairly good idea of what to do against the KID because it is so common which is why either the Benko or the Benoni can be a nice change of pace.

A: You should focus on openings that require thematic or strategic understanding, as opposed to ones that require lots of book-knowledge/theory. Then you will get to positions that you are comfortable in and not have to learn the nuances of sharp and highly-analzyed variations that more experienced players will tend to thrive in.  Basically, an experienced player's "comfort zone" is beating a less-experienced player in a theoretical line: they have a risk free way of leaving the opening with an advantage. If you take away that theoretical advantage, I would argue they will be less comfortable facing you.
IM Andrew Martin discusses opening repertoires here. Based on the above, from his list of opening repertoires I would then suggest:

For White: Trompowski and Pseudo-Trompowski
1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5! And 1 d4 d5 2 Bg5! A must here will be to get hold of as many Julian Hodgson games as possible- he has been carving up Patzer and Grandmaster alike for many, many years. At the heart of this repertoire is the limitation of Black's choices- you are conducting the game on your terms. The positions can be different too- White can opt for Pawn structure play or outright attack depending on how he is feeling.
For Black: Scandinavian and Slav set-ups
Rock solid. As Black vs 1 e4 play the main line BANKER with 1...d5 2 exd5 Qxd5 3 Nc3 Qd8! or 3...Qa5, in both cases following with ...Nf6, ...c6 and ...Bf5! And vs d4 and Flank Openings go for the solid Slav set up with ...c6 and ..d5, aiming for a similar structure. Truly an opening which can be learned in a minimum of time .


A: The Benko gambit is good if you're playing black.
[FEN ""]
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5 b5


A: GM Edmar Mednis wrote an excellent book on How to Defeat a Superior Opponent, in which he states that you should not attempt to play to your opponent's weaknesses, but instead play to your strengths.
This means that you should:


*Know what playing style suits you

*Pick a few openings that lead to games of that kind

*Learn the main ideas of those openings, and some key variations (and any traps)

Then he adds:


*Find opportunities to create complexity in the position, so that your opponent has a higher chance of making a mistake

There are a few off-the-beaten path openings that will force him out of his book, but they will only give you an advantage if you are also comfortable in the positions to which those openings lead.  If you're both at sea, he's still going to win.
If he's over 2200, you should expect him to have a pet line for each of:


*The Sokolsky Opening

*Grob's Attack

*The Budapest Gambit

*The Benko Gambit

*The Vienna Game and Gambit

*The King's Gambit (this would really be asking for it)

*The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit

*The Sicilian Wing Gambit (if he plays the Sicilian)

*The French Wing Gambit (if he plays the French)

*The Trompowsky

*The Evans Gambit

*The Scotch Game and Gambit

*Bird's Opening

*The Dutch Defense

*Alekhine's Defense

*The Scandinavian, including the Icelandic Gambit

*The Danish Gambit

*The Göring Gambit

but you might catch him with (in order of solidity):


*The Two Knights Tango

*The Chigorin Defense (QGD)

*The Urusov Gambit

*The Winckelmann-Riemer Gambit in the French


Q: What are good openings to study to get more experienced players out of their comfort zone? Sometimes I end up getting the opportunity to play a friendly game with someone who has played a lot more chess than I have; these games seem more fun and interesting for everyone (and I seem to end up with a better chance of winning) when I can push play away from common positions without incurring a big early disadvantage. Are there openings that I can study to accomplish that more dependably?

A: You should play the positions that you play the most and are most comfortable in. Since it is unlikely that those same openings are also the most common for your opponent, you will be relatively more comfortable in them than he is.
The problem with playing a special opening just against experienced players is that you will be just as uncomfortable playing them as they are. That is, unless the experienced player happens to know it, then it's actually only uncomfortable for you...

A: The Alekhine's Defence as black. It's a great practical, attacking weapon:
[FEN ""]
1. e4 Nf6
2. e5 Nd5
3. d4 d6


A: You can play a surprising opening, which your more experienced opponent has probably encountered very rarely, like a gambit or a rare sideline. Theoretically-wise you will stand on more even ground then. Even better, since you will play this line often, you will have more practice with it than him, improving the odds even more. But usually such openings are seldom played for a reason, at example because they are unsound, or you have to remember very complicated lines, or they offer less winning chances than competing opening systems. There are so many such opening systems (there are even periodicals dealing exclusively with them) I don't list any of them over others.
Apart from this general thought I would suggest a more detailed approach. Try to understand what the exact nature of the advantages of your opponent (or what your own disadvantages) are and act accordingly:


*Tactically much better than you?  => go for quiet lines with focus on strategic plans,
use closed systems with few tactics so you deny him the use of his
advantage

*Much better theoretical opening knowledge? => use sidelines
and shaky gambits, and pray he doesn't know those ugly refutations
and critical lines

*Strategically much better? => choose simple
systems and learn the ideas behind them thoroughly. You will close the
gap soon and know the resulting structures as good as he.

*Generally better in every aspect? => play what you like
most and learn from your defeats

A word of warning, though. For a competing mind this might sound like a clever plan. True, it is fun to spring a surprise weapon at a stronger opponent and gain a victory this way. But, and this is a big BUT, in the long run your goal is probably to become a better player over time, and this means gaining a deeper understanding of all the chess topics. Remember you can't get better at tactics by avoiding them ;) When your opponent leaves his comfort zone, he may play weaker. But leaving your own comfort zone makes you stronger - in the long run!

If a King, Knight, and Bishop are pitted against the opposing King, is it possible to force checkmate? I find it very hard to do, enough so that I'm not sure whether there's a clean method.

A: [Edited] The winning plan is to force the king into either of the corners which have the same colour as your bishop. 
This is done in a few steps. 


*

*Force the king to one side of the board so he is stuck on either the a/h file or 1st/8th rank

*Use the W manoeuvre to force the king to the corner of your bishop, then use the motif of knight check on (e.g. Na3+ to hit b1) then mate with your king on b3, knight covering b1 and Bishop mates on the long diagonal (e.g. Bg7#).  


I have put a detailed review of each step of the ending on my website.

A: Yes it is. Check out this video!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3EqM17jvOc
The general rule is to get the opponent king in the same corner as your bishop. Use the knight and king to control the squares of opposite color to the color your bishop controls. Then, drive the opponent king to one of the two corners with the correct color!

A: Yes, mate can be forced in 33 moves from nearly any position, according to Wikipedia.
See the standard "w" maneuver cited in that article.

A: Yes it is possible to force mate.  There's a phenomenal video explaining the process on chessvideos.tv.
If you want to practice the endgame, you can do so on the same site as well.

A: Yes, it can be done. The standard position is to force the enemy king into a corner of the same color as the bishop. Then there are four squares (the corner, the diagonal, and two lateral) squares that need to be attacked.
The bishop attacks the corner and diagonal squares, the king guards one of the lateral squares, and the knight the other one.

A: It is possible, but hard.
Memorizing it doesn't help (it rarely occurs over the board). But, if you try to do it own your own, it will help you with learning how to make better use of minor pieces in the end game.
If you can confine the king to a corner of the same colour as the bishop, then it is over (try it!).
The method most people know is composed of two parts: (i) confine his king to some corner, and (ii) force it to a corner of correct colour (colour of your bishop). Part (ii) is is called the W technique in the lore. Part (i) is easy; part (ii) is not. I recommend against memorizing part (ii).
But being able to do part (i) is a must. Practice it if you cannot do it. If you are good at it, in some positions, you will be able to directly confine the opponent king to a 'right' corner - something that memorizing people cannot. Once you can do part (i) easily, may be just see the 'W technique' more to enjoy than to memorize. It is basically repeatedly forcing the king to move one square closer to the right corner (you fix that corner this time). This is done with a knight maneuver basically. You can then try to do it on your own. Whether you can recreate it or not doesn't matter.
(Note: if you are doing it on your own, it may go beyond the allowed 50 moves and lead to a draw. Don't worry about that. Once you can do it on your own, practice that ending with a friend and try to achieve that mate quicker. )

Q: Is it possible to force checkmate with King, Knight, and Bishop vs. King? If a King, Knight, and Bishop are pitted against the opposing King, is it possible to force checkmate? I find it very hard to do, enough so that I'm not sure whether there's a clean method.

A: Yes, it is possible, and any basic chess manual will demonstrate the method.  As mentioned above, the king must be driven into a corner the color of your bishop.  To those who say it occurs too rarely to bother to learn, I might mention that I was able to steer a rated game into such an ending, knowing that with my understanding of how to do it I could force mate, which I was able to do well within the allotted 50 moves.

The debate on which is the "best" chess website tends to be subjective and thus is inconclusive. On the other hand, the site that has the strongest players should be objectively ascertainable provided metrics are available.
So which is the strongest chess website in terms of:


*Number of registered titled players (FM, WFM, IM, WIM, GM, WGM)

*Number of active (routinely visit) titled players 

*Number of super-GMs (> 2800)

*Or other verifiable metrics.


A: As of 2020 I believe by far the most popular sites to play online chess are lichess, chess.com and chess24.
I am not aware of any publicly available statistics on the metrics you suggest. From what I see many of the top players are active on several sites. 
The commercial websites chess24 and chess.com are likely paying some of the titled players giving them an advantage. Still, even Magnus Carlsen is seen regularly on lichess as well.
On the other hand, what should count most would be, how likely is it that you play a game against a titled player. If that is your aim, the total number of titled players is fairly irrelevant and you'd better look at what tournaments/shows/... the websites offer in this respect.
Banter blitz sessions are one way, but there are also tournaments (particularly those with minimum rating requirements) that are a good way to find titled players.

A: chess.com is definitely one of the contenders. If you're a member, you'd know that GM Carlsen, GM Caruana, GM Nakamura; to name a few, are quite active there.

A: ICC and playchess.com are definitely the top two in terms of the number of registered titled players who play actively.
I was able to find metrics on how many titled players are on ICC, seen here; I couldn't find the numbers for playchess, however they are similar.  Many titled players play on both.

A: The question was which site has the strongest players. I presume this means rating to strength ratio. ICC is the leader there in my opinion, you really have to know your chess to get a good rating; it's a proper 'club'.

I'm wondering what other gambits are proven to be unsound.
Edit: I'm looking for refuted gambits in the strict sense of the word, followed by proof.

So yes, I'm looking for scientific proof.
Also, if a database of almost all games played in a particular gambit shows that the side that initiated the gambit wins almost all the time, this doesn't mean that there isn't a way for that gambit to be refuted, it just means that if there is a way, most people haven't played it.
Above everything, I'm looking for material to learn from. An article that says that Vasik Rajlich or someone else has used a computer cluster and came to a conclusion regarding a certain position, how will I benefit from it if there is no proof? (And please note that that King's-Gambit-busted-by-Rajlich article was in fact a Chessbase April Fools' joke!)

A: A gambit can be proven to be unsound by using a modern chess engine. Having said this, I would like to mention a comic gambit, known as the Fred defense:
[FEN ""]
1.e4 f5 2.exf5 Kf7 3.Qh5+ g6 4.fxg6+ Kg7 5.gxh7 Rxh7 6.Qg4+ Kh8

White has picked up 2 pawns. In return, the black king has done an artificial castle and black's pieces are ready to develop and kick the white queen around the board. The next plan for black is to launch an attack on the white king and catch it before it has time to castle. Also, the plan is to firmly grab the center, which will restrict the development of white's pieces. To theoretically refute a gambit is one thing. To refute it while sitting at the board is a totally different game altogether. That is why gambits are so much fun!

A: I believe there are a few gambits completely solved, that is, analyzed up to positions that either the material advantage is enough to guarantee a win or this win is achieved by means of technique (if the final position is not directly checkmate). The only one that I know a proof of, however, is the Latvian Gambit:
[FEN ""]
1.e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5

The Spanish analyst Alejandro Melchor provides two very insightful .pgn with what he considers to be the refutation of said defense. Here you may download the first one and here you may download the second one. He also wrote an appendix.
They both are deep in calculations and very detailed, if you ever want to play perfect chess against this gambit, then good luck. Even if a gambit is "refuted", not many know these lines and the ensuing complications. This makes almost any gambit, refuted or not, completely playable (provided you are not facing a super-GM).
P.D.: I had to upload the files via a third party, I hopes it's not inconvenient, since I don't know if it's possible to upload files directly via Stackexchange.

A: Here is an article that describes a way to compare (and refute) chess openings.
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2415203

A: As long as chess can't be calculated from beginning to end, it is very hard to scientifically prove an opening to be refuted (aside from lines that leave you with such hopeless situations like a bare king against king and rook, of course).
If you are satisfied with a less scientific proof, I'd say gambits are even less so refuted. In my opinion, nearly all gambits are playable, as long as you won't play it against a superhuman database/program or a world champion. In a practical sense, probably no gambit worth of having a name is refuted in the sense of not being playable. Even if a gambit is widely considered unsound and often results in a worse position, it might contain enough steam to give your chess skill ample opportunities to overpower your opponent.I even remember a game where I suffered terrible against the BDG because I didn't find any refutation over the board. I only won because my opponent terribly misplayed the late midgame, but from the opening point of view he should have won the game.
So my answer is: No gambit I know of is refuted to the degree of being unplayable.

Q: What proofs for refuted gambits are there? I've stumbled upon this article a while ago, and I've also seen refutations for the Muzio Gambit (Joseph Kling &amp; Bernard Horwitz - Chess Studies on Endings of Games). I'm wondering what other gambits are proven to be unsound.
Edit: I'm looking for refuted gambits in the strict sense of the word, followed by proof. Even though a gambit might be playable against someone who doesn't know its refutation, the gambit is still considered refuted if it is proven that the side who initiated the gambit loses in all variations worth looking at against best play. So yes, I'm looking for scientific proof.
Also, if a database of almost all games played in a particular gambit shows that the side that initiated the gambit wins almost all the time, this doesn't mean that there isn't a way for that gambit to be refuted, it just means that if there is a way, most people haven't played it.
Above everything, I'm looking for material to learn from. An article that says that Vasik Rajlich or someone else has used a computer cluster and came to a conclusion regarding a certain position, how will I benefit from it if there is no proof? (And please note that that King's-Gambit-busted-by-Rajlich article was in fact a Chessbase April Fools' joke!)

A: Many gambits are unsound. The proof is told by the number of these played at the highest levels of the game.  So, if you don't see the Blackmar-Diemer gambit at top tournaments, you can assume that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages.  The King's Gambit is one famously busted opening.
That being said, we're not top players. Most of us can't beat the players who can't beat the top players.  I'd wager, charitably, that 75% of the moves we make are wrong, technically.
In short, they're probably all playable.  As always, if you're going to take chances, book up first.  Understand the opening, know the main lines.

A: First of all, to refute a gambit, we need to analyse all the lines to a [forced] win. For example, the Latvian Gambit will result in all lines ending with a material advantage for White able to guarantee a win.
However, for the Muzio Gambit, there is no such proof. Black will eventually have to give a knight back to reduce White's initiative, so there is no proof at all.
EDIT: I ran a bunch of games through Stockfish depth 22 with the Muzio Gambit, and Black eventually loses the knight and the position reaches equality.

A: The Damiano Defense, also known as the five pawns gambit, is practically refuted. You can find the details on the Wikipedia page. The key line is:

*

*e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6? 3. Nxe5! fxe5? 4. Qh5+ Ke7 5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+ d5 7. Bxd5+ Kg6 8. h4 h5 9. Bxb7

After which Black cannot stop Bxa8 with a decisive material advantage for White.

[FEN ""]
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5


A: I would recommend the Schara-Hennig-Gambit for black:
[Title "Schara-Hennig-Gambit"]
[fen "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. cxd5 cxd4 5. Qa4 Bd7 6. Qxd4 exd5 
7. Qxd5 Nf6 8. Qd1 Nc6

It is pretty rare (the Tarrasch is 10 times more common after 3…c5), according to the computer it is sound and if white doesn't know what he is doing he can go down very quickly. 
Here one of my own games, where my strong opponent started burning time after move 5 and couldn't find a way to quell the black initiative.

One word of warning: White doesn't have any structural weaknesses, so black has to come up with something before his initiative evaporates. If you are confident that you will be able to do that, the Schara-Hennig-gambit is the perfect weapon for you. 

A: I don't know whether these 2 opening positions have a name. But I have been on the losing side playing black in both these different types of games. 
At the end of the game for these 2 boards, the white wins by checkmate. And I don't think they are very trivial board positions either.

It is extremely aggressive, and makes for a sharp tactical game without sacrificing too much material.

What other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)

A: As there other answers cover only white's options, let me throw in some black thoughts...
The Benko Gambit is a sharp, but sound and deep opening:
[FEN ""]
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5 b5 

The aggressive, but not-so-sound Budapest Gambit. However, if the opponent doesn't know the theory, she can be soon in serious trouble:
[FEN ""]
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e5
3. dxe5 Ng4  

Finally I like to play the Steinitz variation in the Scotch game, especially in blitz. If the opponent doesn't know the theory, it's quite unlikely he comes up with the only correct plan Nb1-c3-b5 by himself:
[FEN ""]
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6

A: Probably the most aggressive opening without being unplayable in chess is Double Muzio Gambit in King's Gambit, which suicide-bombs two minor pieces at f7 for a wildest possible opening attack:
[FEN ""]
[Title "Double Muzio Gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O! {Strongest continuation, Muzio gambit! White sacrifices a piece for better development and attack(a very wild one)} gxf3 6.

White has two big pieces in f-file, and also black king is on the same file, white has a clear development advantage, shortly white has the wildest possible attack in 8 moves}

I invite you to see this nice analysis about Double Muzio Gambit
I played this variation succesfully in OTB games. If you think that this can't be playable, then check this master game:

If you think that the line is unplayable and white is winning just because of being stronger about 130 Elo, then check this evaluation of Komodo-9.3. A GM-slayer chess engine can't find a winning advantage too:
[Title "After 10...Qf6 | Komodo-9.3 Depth:31 -0.30"]

If it can't find, we can say that our opponents can't find over the board too. Therefore, we can say that this line is definitely not a cheap opening trap, and absolutely playable. Black seems to have only a little advantage in this very uncomfortable extremely sharp defensive position, while White is enjoying the attack.

What other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)

A: I don't think anyone has mentioned the Staunton Gambit:
[FEN ""]

1.d4 f5 2.e4 fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6

which I had the opportunity to play successfully against the computer earlier this week when it played the Dutch Defense.  It can be seen as a sounder relative of the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.e4) since 1...f5 does not contribute to Black's development and leaves the black king slightly exposed, which 2.e4 aims to take advantage of. It's sufficient for dynamic equality and can provide White with a very dangerous attack if Black is not adequately prepared for it.
And the From Gambit is a strong, albeit double-edged, response to Bird's opening (1. f4 e5 2. fxe5 [2. e4 transposes to the King's Gambit] d6 3. exd6 Bxd6).  If White is careless, Black can generate some quick Fool's Mate variation kingside mating attacks based on the absence of the f2 pawn and the weakness on the e1-h4 diagonal.

A: It is difficult to force an aggressive position in any opening.  Even in the King's Gambit, Black can simply play 2...d6 or Bc5 to reach a more positional type of position.
With that said, some popular openings traditionally thought to be more aggressive include the Sicilian Defence, the Dutch Defence, the Albin Counter-Gambit, the Benko Gambit, the King's Indian Defense, the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, and an array of gambits on 1. e4.

A: Perhaps the most insanely aggressive opening that's remotely playable is the Halloween Gambit,
[FEN ""]
[Title "Halloween Gambit"]

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. Nxe5?!

It seems to defy logic that White can sacrifise a whole knight for merely a pawn and a speculative advantage in space and time, but sometimes aggression has a logic all its own. The White pawns roll up-board, attacking moves come naturally for White, while Black mis-steps can rapidly lead to catastrophe.
Strangely enough, Black's best idea in practical play may be to calmly counter-sac his own knight and play for a slight but sure positional advantage.
See also the Cochrane Gambit, a similar idea, but with a more distinguished pedigree.

A: I recommend to try Grob's Attack. This opening is very agressive for both white and black. And a lot of players don't know to play correctly in this opening as I found.
[FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]
1. g4

Black can answer with Romford Countergambit, for example:
[FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]
1. g4 d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 d4 4. Bxb7 Nd7 5. Bxa8 Qxa8 6. f3 d3


A: I personally like the Grob opening, especially for blitz.
It goes:

*

*g4

And, just an example of a continuation:
.. d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 e6 4. Qb3
I also like using the same idea as black playing against 1. e4. For example:

*

*e4 g5 2. d4 Bg7 3. Bxg5 3. c5 4. Be3 Qb6

The computer evaluation isn't always sound, but in practical play (in blitz), it works pretty well.

A: The Caveman variation (Caro-kann advance variation sideline) should do the trick:
[FEN ""]
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. h4 h5 5. Bg5 Qb6 6. Bd3!? Bxd3 7. Qxd3 Qxb2 8. e6!

If Black takes the free rook, you get a strong attack.
The only problem is that you'll have to get your opponent to play THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF MOVES, which is very difficult considering the length of the line.

A: The Open Sicilian (1.e4 c5 followed by 2.Nf3 and 3.d4) counts, in my view. White immediately gets a lead in development and great attacking chances, in return for some positional sacrifice, most notably the 1v2 pawns in the center.
This opening is famous for its wild sacrificial attacks, in my opinion even more so than the king's gambit. Piece sacrifices on b5, d5 and e6, and black exchange sacrifices on c3 are the order of the day.
And best of all: almost all top players play it. It's actually good.

A: Sometimes, one way to get overtly aggressive in a reasonably sound way is to throw out an early g4 pawn thrust in an otherwise vanilla, mainline position. For instance, in the Anti-Meran 6.Qc2 variation of the Semi-Slav, the gambit move 7.g4!? was popularized by Shirov and Shabalov:
[fen ""]

1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Qc2 Bd6 7.g4!?

Speaking of Shirov, he pioneered a similar idea with 5.g4!? against the Pirc move-order of the Philidor Defense, and one could also try it a move earlier:
[fen ""]

1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 (4.g4!?) e5 5.g4!?


Q: What are examples of very aggressive openings? One of my favorite openings is the King's Gambit.  It is extremely aggressive, and makes for a sharp tactical game without sacrificing too much material.  It isn't played much at the highest level at standard time controls, but even today it is occasionally used in blitz by top level players such as Hikaru Nakamura.
What other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)

A: Indirectly Benoni Defense is one of the best opening for modern chess player. (A66)
[FEN ""]
[Title "Beoni Defense"]

1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 c5
3.d5 e6
4.Nc3 exd5
5.cxd5 d6
6.e4 g6
7.f4


A: Two interesting gambit trees to be aware of are:
1) The Scotch/Goring/Italian/Danish gambit complex (there's a lot of opportunity to transpose among them). These start out with:
1. e4 e5 2. d4 ed 3. c3 (Danish)
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 ed 4. c3 (Goring)
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 ed 4. Bc4 (Scotch)
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d4 (Italian)

The transpositions among them (and into both the Two Knight's and the Max Lange) should be enough to gratify anyone.
2) The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. The basic line of this is:
1. d4 d5 2. e4 de 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3

But the utility of this gambit lies in the great potential for transposition from semi-open e4 defenses:
1. e4 d5 2. d4 (from Center Counter)
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Be3 de (from French)
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3 5. bc de 6. f3 (also French)
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 (from Alekhine's)
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 de 4. f3 (from Caro-Kann)

You can basically run any response to e4 except ...e5 and ...c5 and ...d6 into a BDG (and with the Sicilian or Pirc, you might find enough life in the f3 systems to keep you playing some sharp games even then).

A: The Smith-Morra Gambit is aggressive for white.
[fen ""]
1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 (4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2)

White has sacrificed a pawn (or two) to free up his development. 

A: Let me recommend two sharp opening variations for the black pieces: the Sicilian Najdorf and Semi-Slav Botvinnik variation. They lead to dynamic and complicated positions with chances for both sides. They are excellent for playing for a win with the black pieces. To master one or both of these variations, I recommend getting at least one modern book per variation and study these in great detail. Also, check all grandmaster games you can find and explore the ideas for both sides in these positions.
The starting position of the Sicilian Najdorf is reached after
[FEN ""]
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6

Let's try to understand this position. Black has a statically better position thanks to the semi-open c-file. This means that an exchange of queens in this position is beneficial for black. White will fight for the d5 square and try to plant a light piece there. Black will try to deliver the d6-d5 center blow, thematic for the Sicilian system. White castles queenside in the sharpest Najdorf variations. Black castles kingside, queenside or stays with the King in the center, depending on the situation. Black chooses between the setups e7-e6, e7-e5 and g7-g6. White chooses between f2-f3 and f2-f4.
When white castles queenside, black attacks with the b- and a-pawns as well as the thematic exchange sac Rc8xNc3 bxc3, ruining the queenside pawn structure. If this exchange sac can be followed by picking up the e4-pawn, then it can be done at virtually any moment. Another thematic plan for black is placing a knight on e5 (after white's f-pawn is either on f5 or exchanged off) or c4 (attacking the b2-pawn and undermining the c3-knight).
The starting position of the Semi-Slav Botvinnik is reached after
[FEN ""]
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5

At first glance, black just grabbed the c4-pawn and is trying to hold on to it for dear life. Yet things are more subtle than this. Black has entered an assymetric position where white has to find dynamic plans to compensate for the material loss. It also looks like white is winning with e4-e5. Yet again, things are not so simple at all. A bit deeper we reach the following position
[FEN ""]
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 Nbd7 11.exf6

White will try to win using the extra kingside pawns. White can also launch an attack on the black King. Black will try to win by launching an attack on the white King, after developing with Bc8-b7, Qd8-b6 and O-O-O. White will most probably castle kingside, since staying in the center or castling queenside looks spooky. Black will open the a8-h1 diagonal and attack the isolated d4-pawn. I have used both these variations with joy and success. They are simply awesome!

Q: What are examples of very aggressive openings? One of my favorite openings is the King's Gambit.  It is extremely aggressive, and makes for a sharp tactical game without sacrificing too much material.  It isn't played much at the highest level at standard time controls, but even today it is occasionally used in blitz by top level players such as Hikaru Nakamura.
What other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)

A: Sicilian Defense, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack
Another pretty sharp opening for both sides is The Sicilian Dragon, with the Yugoslav Attack being one of the sharpest variations. It differs from most of the openings listed here because it's not a gambit, but still a very sharp and dangerous opening with lots of threats for both White and Black.
9. Bc4  being the more aggressive move and 9. O-O-O  goes for more tactical play.
[FEN ""]
[Title "Sicilian Defense / Dragon Variation / Yugoslav Attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 (9. O-O-O)


A: The most (overly-)aggressive openings I know of that aren't too bad would probably be the Danish Gambit (Accepted) and the Fried Liver Attack.

Danish Gambit Accepted:
[FEN ""]
1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2 

White gets three open files and both bishops on open diagonals facing black's king; black gets two pawns.  Usually considered slightly better for black, but played occasionally even up to master level.

Fried Liver Attack:
[FEN ""]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7!? Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 8. Nc3  

White sacrifices a knight to get Black's king out right away.  Proper defense is extremely difficult over the board, but played correctly, black is thought to have a slight advantage.  In most lines, white wins their material back.

What other openings for black or white would force these kind of very aggressive, tactical, sharp and open games?  (Without putting yourself in too bad a position.)

A: The Alekhine's defence (1.e4 Nf6) is also a great attacking weapon for black, as it is a highly aggressive and provocative opening that lures white into overextending its centre, which can then be targeted (generally) via the knights on c6 and b6, trading the knight on f3 for your light square bishop, and sometimes even castling on the queen side to really target white's d pawn.
Take a look at the opening moves in the most common variations (Modern, Albert, Carlsen, 4 pawns, etc) and see if you like the resulting positions for black. It is a good practical weapon in tournament play, and white is frequently caught off-guard, as it is a rare opening (however, many world champions have played it (Fischer, Spassky, Tal, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe etc. and it is still sometimes used at the highest level today by Carlsen, Shabalov, Kamsky etc.)

A: The Fried Liver is good, and according to Stockfish, black would NOT have a "slight advantage" even if they defend properly.

A: Luccini Gambit

A: I read all the comments , by your post I think you need a new opening to learn which has a solid reputation but aggressive in nature which always favorite of many chess player club players and grand masters . If you are trying to find new gambit lines then you can try The gambit  by M.yudovich , but if you want aggressive but solid openings first, I want to recommend you Vienna Game it also can transfer from the bishop's opening which goes like , 1.e4 e5 2. (Nc3/Bc4) (Nf6/Nc6/Bc5/others) 3.(Bc4/Nc3) {now after nf6 there is also frakenstein-dracula line which will be like 3..Nxe4 4.Qh5 which always a drawish line but you can pressurize your opponent and he/she can fall into your traps} 3....Bc5(after nf6) 4.d3 d6 5.Ne2 0-0 6.0-0 Nc6 7.Kh1 Be6 8.f4(and suddenly you can see it is a solid version of king's gambit) which always played by many top players recently it's been a fashion for top players to refute petrov defence or russian defence (1.e4 e5 2Nf3 Nf6). Now e4 is played for many many years to have the main purpose checkmate the king with controlling the f7 square. In the e4 lines I also like the opening called the Najdorf sicilian english attack, (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Be3) , 6. Bg5 is also aggressive which all comes into the main pawn race with g4 , g5 , and in the side of d4 openings solid and aggressive lines can be found in the A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire by Aaron Summerscale , ( the barry attack is one of favourites from that book which goes like 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 , with the plans of going in pawn race with h4 or g4 this opening also been mastered by GM mark hebden and also a new form of this opening been played by famous GM baadur jobava and the opening is named as jobava opening . Now you can also read A Ferocious Opening Repertoire by C. LAKDAWALA which includes veresov opening with f3 lines . And with black against e4 my favorite opening is najdorf (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6)and also can play tiger modern (1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6) and against d4 you can play Grünfeld Defence(1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5) and you can play dutch defence (1. d4 f5 ) and this is also aggressive but solid played by many player you will find many examples in the ginger gm youtube channel.I don't recognize benko gambit as a aggressive opening cause a if your opponent knows then it can be not an aggressive one.And also other openings. Anyway Best Of Luck!!

I know about Chess960, and you can play that online at lichess.org. Furthermore, I like playing Go as well. But are there any good variants and other ways to train that you use, and you know to work well?

A: I believe that studying Shogi added 50 points to my chess game.  They are related games and thus share some related concepts.  I believe Shogi showed me things about chess I had not understood before.

A: Wikipedia has a pretty complete listing of chess variants broken down by:


*Chess with different starting positions

*Chess with different forces

*Chess with different boards

*Chess with unusual rules

*Chess with incomplete information or elements of chance

*Multimove variants

*Multiplayer variants

*Single player variants

*Chess with unusual (fairy) pieces

*Chess hybrids

*Games inspired by chess


A: In addition to the two nice answers already provided, I would like to mention the variant King of the hill, whose difference with normal checked is the following: in addition to checkmate, a legal move that moves one's own king to one of the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) wins.
This helps a lot for the control of squares. Indeed, one cannot neglect any center square. If one of the center squares is too weak, then soon or later the opponent will take profit of it.

A: Playing other variants should only have a marginal effect on improvement, and sometimes it's bad(makes you think in ways optimal for the variant, but not for chess). Since others have not mentioned it, playing blindfold chess may help with visualizations, but probably can only be played after a certain level of competency in chess, but I suppose blindfold chess is generously defined as a chess variant.
Of course the best way to improve at chess is to play/study chess.

Is castling possible if any of the squares involved in the castling are under attack, or is this a problem only if the squares moved through by the king are under attack and not the ones moved through by the rook?

A: Yes, you can, as long as the king doesn't pass through or end up on an attacked square.
From FIDE Laws of Chess:

3.8.2.1   The right to castle has been lost:
           
3.8.2.1.1   if the king has already moved, or
           
3.8.2.1.2   with a rook that has already moved.
3.8.2.2   Castling is prevented temporarily:
           
3.8.2.2.1   if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one
or more of the opponent's pieces, or
           
3.8.2.2.2   if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected.


A: You can castle when all of these conditions hold true:


*

*The King and the Rook did not make any moves so far.

*The King is not in check.

*The King will not pass a threatened square during castling.

*The King will not land on a threatened square.
Condition 3 might need clarification. For example, you have the white pieces and you want to castle kingside. Then, you are using your Ke1 and Rh1 for castling. Let's say that conditions 1 and 2 are fulfilled. Next, the g1 square should not be threatened in order to fulfill condition 4. Finally, the King will pass the square f1 on its way to g1. Thus, the square f1 should not be threatened for condition 3 to hold true!

A: Yes, if the rook is threatened, you may still castle. The threatened squares rule only applies to squares where the king passes (starting and final position included).
For example, in the case of white castling queenside, for instance, a threat to a1 or b1 does not prevent the castle from taking place.

A: One nice example of this is in this game, where a player named Feuer takes advantage of the ability to castle queenside while b1 is attacked to play a beautiful combination.

A: The rules are that the king can't castle into check, through check, or when in check. This applies to the king's square, plus the two squares to the right or left.
Castling is permitted when the rook is under attack (on the rook's square). On the queen side, that would also include the knight's square. But not on the kingside, because the king would be castling into check. He also can't castle if the bishop's or queen's square is under attack. 

A: There is more on the condition to consider
The King and Rook have to be on the same rank, otherwise Pam-Krabbe castling would be possible.
Pam-Krabbe castling is basically a vertical castling, where the king would castle with a promoted pawn. This is not allowed anymore. 

A: Here is a problem that I published in the MatPlus.net forums a few months ago. It demonstrates how the rook can move through squares that are attacked. The squares a1 and b1 are maximally guarded. If it were on a board, it would definitely frustrate a few people, which is the exact point of this little exercise!

I have usually found the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez to be very potent and very hard to counter.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. c3 d5

Are there any proven defensive lines or variations to use against this?
Just point me in the right direction, please.

A: A huge amount of theory has just been discovered in the Marshall Attack (I'm assuming you mean the line in the Ruy Lopez). However, this variation has recently fallen out of practice among top level GMs because white has been hard-pressed to find decent replies to the most critical lines. Basically, I would recommend playing one of the anti-Marshall games (8. h3 has been popular) unless you want to spend days studying opening theory to reach a suspect position with white.
Wikipedia has an article on the Marshall attack which is worth reading.

A: The "classic" defense against the Marshall Attack was waged against Marshall himself by Jose Raul Capablanca, the future world champion, in 1918.  See this article about the game.
Since then, lines have evolved on both sides, but the underlying principles remain the same. Master the one game, and you'll go a long way to mastering the defense as a whole.

A: I'm posting this because this year some very interesting games have been played showing new ideas just discovered for White which can give an idea of how difficult it is to prepare especially at the very top level.
The first game that I want to mention is the game between Ivanchuk and Wesley So played this year in Wijk aan Zee. So played a new line (well known to the top players thanks to an article published by Anish Giri in New in Chess). Ivanchuk didn't know the line and got crushed. You can see an analysis of the game by the GM Jan Gustafsson here.
The second one is one played in the final of the World Cup in Baku between Peter Svidler and Sergey Karjakin which also displayed a very interesting line. It was a blitz game where Svidler got a huge advantage thanks to his better preparation but finally lost due to blundering a rook.
To sum up, if you're interested I recommend you the series of videos made by Jan Gustafsson for Chess 24 called Latest Trends on the Marshall where you can find some very interesting ideas for both Black and White like the two mentioned above.

A few years back I used to play with a player who always accepted the queens gambit pawn and used to hold on to it and sometimes win with the pawn plus.
Is there any specific variation that can be studied in favour of black in queen's gambit accepted?

A: Black can sometimes hold on to the Pawn if that is the goal.  Black has to play an early a6 and b5.  One possible variation is:
[FEN ""]
1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 a6 4. e3 b5

Although Black will hold on to the extra C-Pawn, White can counterattack with a4, b3, and Nc3.  Black has neglected development, and according to MegaBase 2012, White scores 60.6% from the diagrammed position with the move 5. a4.

A: There are ways to hold onto the pawn, but most of them leave Black with a dreadful position where his entire position is built around hanging onto the pawn.  Moves like Be6, c6, b5, and Qa5 are examples of strategies that could be employed.
In the Slav and Semi-Slav defenses, there are in fact a lot of variations in which black is able to comfortably (somewhat) hold onto the pawn.  I would check those out if I were you.

Most chess literature offer sets of moves based on themes, but do not offer a method of accessing your performance in composing sets of moves relative to the flow of the game itself. 
What would be the best way to segment sets of moves, and then assess the effectiveness of their composition relative to the board's state?

A: I would try breaking your games down by sub-goals and examine the moves leading up to achieving that sub-goal which gives you an easy metric on how well the set of moves performed.  Of course, the harder part is to assess your sub-goals.  Did you have the right overall plan?  Did your sub-goals improve your position?  I'm not sure if breaking your evaluation down to the "set of moves" level will ultimately be useful.
For instance, you can set a sub-goal of controlling the c-file so the set of moves that contribute to doubling the rooks on the c-file evaluate as "good".  However, if your opponent is invested in an attack on the king-side, your sub-goal might be faulty.
Take a look at some middlegame books, games collections, and/or tournament books.  Try something like IM Jeremy Silman's "How To Reassess Your Chess" and/or GM Bronstein's annotations of the Zurich 1953 tournament.
The former will give you some ways to approach thinking about your position and formulating goals while the latter will delve into the thought process behind the moves of real games of grandmasters.

I had heard from someone that Chess evolved from Chaturanga then Shatranj.  Are there any pointers towards this?
I would like to know counter arguments as well, if any.

A: Chaturanga indeed is chess. In Hindi language Chaturanga (shatranj in Arablic), is what chess (which is in English) called.

A: Chaturanga is the ancient game that gave birth to board games chess, shogi, makruk, xiangqi and janggi. I believe Chaturanga is the same game as Shatranj or got only slightly varied while moved from India to Sassanid Persia. There is another variation of chess Chaturaji which used 2 dices and 4 players (Ludo style) around 11th century or slightly earlier. The game of chess evolved from Shatranj and got most of the current rules around 15th century in Spain. It was only at late 19th century that Chess as we know of has been formalized.

A: Those two games are indeed early forms of chess. The pieces were similar, although their moves were different, and there were some chess rules that had not yet been invented; however, chess evolved from those early games.

A: I found this article very informative:
http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200904/the.game.of.kings.htm
These sections were particularly relevant:

Chess, however, was not invented in Persia. All early Persian references to chess use the term chatrang, from the Sanskrit chaturanga (“in four parts”), which describes the four components of an early Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. The use of a Sanskrit-derived word for chess in an early Persian romance suggests an Indian origin for the game and not local invention, although supporting evidence is murky.
...
The only convincing early Indian mention of chess is in a romance attributed to the sixth century, thus slightly earlier than the first Persian and Central Asian evidence. The poet Subandhu used a chess image to describe the monsoon season:
The time of the rains played its game with frogs for chessmen which, yellow and green in color … leapt up on the black field squares.
A story of the seventh-century Persian king Nushirvan (recorded by Firdawsi in the 11th-century Shahnamah, or Book of Kings) also supports an Indian origin of chess. An envoy came from India, the story says, “with elephants, parasols, and cavalry” and a chessboard, chessmen and a challenge: If Nushirvan’s courtiers could figure out the basic rules of the game, then unknown in Persia, the Indian king would gladly pay tribute to the Persian monarch. If they failed, however, Nushirvan would pay tribute to the Indian king. Nobles and priests labored without success for a week. Finally, after a day and a night of struggle, Nushirvan’s vizier deciphered and described the game:
The sage has invented a battlefield, in the midst of which the king takes up his station. To the left and right of him the army is disposed, the foot-soldiers occupying the rank in front. At the king’s side stands his sagacious counselor, advising him on the strategy to be carried out during the battle. In the two directions the elephants are posted with their faces turned toward the conflict. Beyond them are stationed the war-horses, on which are mounted two resourceful riders, and fighting alongside them to the left and right are turrets ready for the fray


A: Chaturanga was evolved 2000 yrs ago. Chaturanga is based on Ashtpaad board (8×8) which was again modified. Many modern variants including Modern Chess are supposedly derived from Chaturanga.
Before Ashtpaad board, Dashpaad board existed on 10x10. If you go through the historical evidences, you will find these boards. On Dashpaad board, Shadyantra or Shatranjan was played. So, Dashpaad is the most ancient board, and Shad Yantra is the most oldest game.

When I was young I used to play chess with the the old form of notation KB&lt;number> (King Bishop square number), even books used to have the same notation, then later found that everyone was using algebraic, is descriptive notation dead? Why?

A: To answer your question if descriptive notation is dead, I would say YES.  Even though it maybe more descriptive, it can be more confusing for newer players and the algebraic notation is so much more intuitive and simpler to understand.  I have read books with the descriptive notation and sometimes I scratch my head.

A: I used to read chess books in the 1960's. Then DN was the only commonly understood system.  I didn't go looking for chess books again until this year 2018.  Now everything is in AN.  I have a book published in the 1970's bought recently second hand it actually uses both.  I recently found some chess magazines in Spanish from the 1990's they all use AN. 
For me DN is much more intuitive...not really intuitive ...just common sense.  There are two people sitting at the board, so there really ARE two perspectives.
WW

A: Though the previous answers have made some solid points, I think they have not yet given the main reason why algebraic notation has generally come to be preferred over descriptive notation: it is more absolute, less relative, than descriptive notation. What I mean is just this: in algebraic notation each square on the chessboard receives only one name, while in descriptive notation each square receives a different name depending on whether a move by white is being notated or a move by black. This alone makes algebraic notation more transparent, because things aren't relative to which side is on the move.
Consider, say, the g4 square (in algebraic notation). When white moves a piece there, descriptive notation says it is headed to KN4. But if black is moving a piece there, it is headed to KN5. There is just no need to have two names for this square, and it serves only to sow possible confusion in a way that algebraic notation does not.

A: The two forms of notation you are referring to are called Descriptive Notation and Algebraic Notation respectively. Descriptive notation was the most used form from recent antiquity up until about 1970 in English speaking countries. Algebraic notation has been around since the 19th century, but didn't rise to its current prominence until the 20th century. These days, descriptive notation is considered obsolete, though it is still permitted in tournament play in the FIDE. There are a minority of players that exercise this choice, though. Primarily, descriptive notation is learned and used for reading older chess books which were authored that way.
There are also some other interesting notations in use around the world. Hope that helps clear things up.

I have observed that the King's Gambit is usually not played at international level.  Is there any specific reason for this?

A: David Bronstein, in his book "The Modern Chess Self-Tutor," gives an interesting explanation for not playing it. Don't forget, he's used it many times in GM practice, including memorable games against Tal and Petrosian (the latter was an exhibition game in which they explore more fully an idea from an Alekhine-Keres game).
His reasoning for 2. Nf3 being preferable to 2. f4 is that like 2. d4, 2. f4 fully declares White's intentions too early in the game. White is better off playing something like 2. Nf3, when Black still has no idea what sort of game White is aiming for. He doesn't think it's necessarily worse, just that playing it makes Black's choices easier. 2. Nf3 keeps White's options open.

A: The King's Gambit is considered inferior because white is sacrificing king safety along with a pawn on move 2.  Furthermore, although white would get an attack going along the f file in Morphy's day, now the correct defensive ideas are known for black and white has a harder time of it.
That said, the King's Gambit is a great weapon at the club level.  In fact, Quality Chess will be releasing a book on the King's Gambit very soon.  

A: One item that is not a reason that the King's Gambit isn't played more at the international level is this specious article from Chessbase News: "Busting the King's Gambit, this time for sure." In the article, Vasik Rajlich, the author of Rybka, claims that all moves but 3.Be2 lead to a forced win for Black, while that move draws. However, though this was posted on April 2, 2012, rather than on April 1, the article was in fact one of Chessbase's annual April Fools' posts.

A: Top players don't play sharp gambits such as this one much because they involve lots of forced lines. These lines are easy to calculate for an engine. The result is that you no longer play against your opponent - you're pitting your engine / memorization skills vs. theirs, and not your chess ability vs. theirs.
Source: Romantic chess in modern times


A: Typically, White wants to play the King's gambit to play some crazy lines, full of sacrifices and double-edged play like the Kieseritzky Gambit:


    [FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]

    1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 Nf6



With a messy position on move 5 already !
And there are so many lines like that if Black is ready to accept the challenge. But that is a big IF.
First, there is this defense advocated by Fischer everyone is mentioning that seems to be OK for black:


    [FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]

    1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6



This move d6 simply removes the e5-square for the Knight, and this alone makes White's attack harder to carry on.
But I think that, really, what can discourage White to play the King's gambit, especially at higher level, is that Black can simply opt for an early d7-d5 setup, that usually gives a full (and quite boring) equality:


    [FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]

    1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 exf4



And honestly, after these 3 move, it is hard to see how White can attack...
Check my introduction on the King's gambit if you want to get an idea on how to play this nevertheless interesting opening.

A: One of the more common lines for the King's Gambit is accepting, followed by 3. Nf3.  That is, 1. e4 e5  2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3.  After this, black can follow with 3... d6, 
the so called Fischer defense.  Fischer was extremely confident that this was a bad position for white.  He wrote an entire article about this line, and famously said, "In my opinion the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force."  On top of this he added, "Of course White can always play differently, in which case he merely loses differently."
I am not sure about other lines, but likely top grandmasters have analyzed them, and come to similar conclusions that white's position is not a good one.
Remark: Interestingly Fischer himself played the gambit a few times with great success, but he opened 3. Bc4. 

Q: Why is the King's Gambit not played often? I have observed that the King's Gambit is usually not played at international level.  Is there any specific reason for this?

A: (I'm adding another answer because it's fundamentally different from the one I wrote above.)
GMs don't play the King's Gambit because it's inferior.

Eventually, Leela reached the safe harbour that is the dream of every King’s Gambit player: a worse but holdable ending!

Source (in the comments to games 19-20)
In other words, at GM level, your target when you play the King's Gambit is a worse but holdable ending. This is reflected by the opening eval that engines give - usually around -1 after 1. e4 e5 2. f4.
Since White has an advantage in the starting position &amp; you should be playing to win, a worse but holdable endgame is not acceptable. By extension, GMs don't play the King's Gambit.
(At amateur level the dream of every King's Gambit player is a mating attack in the middlegame.)

Nf3 f6 have to be a bad opening? There seems to be a pretty nifty attack for White after  1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6:
[FEN ""]

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5 fxe5 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5+ Qe7 6.Qxh8

I've played as White with this opening several times, always to my advantage (usually Black panics and plays 4 ... Ke7, soon after which he finds ample reason to resign).  But once someone played as shown above, and went on with
6. ...     Nf6,
  etc.

to try and put my queen on the spot.  Presumably he intended to follow up with moves such as ...b6, ...Bb7 or similar, ...Nc3 or similar, ...O-O-O, and then ...Bg7 forcing Qxd8.  Since it was a blitz game, best play was not made, and he made a mistake allowing my queen to escape, but it got me thinking.  Is there some way Black can recover from 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6?
My question especially regards 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 3. Nxe5 fxe5 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 (as shown above) - is there a way to trap White's Q?  Or is 3... fxe5 simply a bad move?  Should 2... f6 be avoided altogether?

A: This opening is also known as the Damiano Defense and it is just bad.  
In the line you gave, where black plays 6... Nf6, white's best plan is to play d3 and Bg5.  Black can't move the bishop because it is pinned (so the queen can't be trapped until black castles).

A: No, the Damiano Defense does not lose by force so it's not a bad opening.
If you analyze it with a computer you won't be able to find a variation that wins for white against best play.
After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5, playing 3...fxe5 will lose for black but playing 3...Qe7 will hold the game. For example check out the game Fischer vs McGregor, 1964 (here's a version with commentary on YouTube), which ended in a draw.

A: After 
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5 fxe5 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5+ Qe7 6.Qxh8 Nf6

with ideas of trapping the queen, 7. d3 followed by Bg5 or Bh6 and there won't be any issues getting the queen out, e.g.:
7.d3 d5 8.Bg5 Nbd7 9.Nc3 b6 10.0-0-0 Bb7 11.e5

Black can try to minimize the damage after 2...f6? with something like 3.Nxe5 Qe7
You aren't losing the exchange any more, but you've still destroyed your position with ...f6.  
2... f6 should be avoided.

A: White has a forced win of a bunch of material after either 4... g6 or 4... Ke7, but if you're into silly "psychological" justifications for moves, you could argue that 4... Ke7 makes White think a little harder to find the win, while Black can prep it.
4. ... Ke7 
5. Qxe5+ Kf7 
6. Bc4+ d5
7. Bxd5+ Kg6
8. h4 h6

This is the only line that leaves White with an overwhelming advantage; for instance, one game between relatively weak players continued:
8. Qg3+? Qg5
9. Qxc7 Ne7
10. Qd6+? [h4!] Kh5

(Feng-Sloan 2010)
After which Black looks hopeless... 

...but is actually just bad.
However, you may already know that if White plays correctly up to 8 ... h6, they have a killer 9th move that picks up material. Here's a diagram as an exercise for the reader:

(answer)

A: The damiano cannot protect the pawn and weakens kingside. Just say, damiano himself is pretty annoyed by it getting named after him.

Is there any specific point where the middle-game ends and end-game begins? E.g. after x number of pieces are exchanged, or say 40 moves, etc.

A: According to the classic old book of Romanovski (which was one of the cornerstones of the Russian/Soviet school of chess) the endgame starts when the King assumes an active role.

A: The middle game starts as soon as the opening ends, and well, it is very easy to know when openings start and end, almost any opening (if not all) have names and are well known and studied. But if I were forced to say an specific moment in time, I would say around the time where they start castling or exchanging serious material to gain position advantage.
However, the end game is harder to accurately say when it starts, my best guess will be somewhere where the kings start moving towards the center and players have usually no more than 2 minor pieces or 4 pawns. Anytime where it is possible to calculate the result using Endgame Tablebases.
It is also worth mentioning that the point where something starts and ends vary from game to game (e.g if the players decide to quickly exchange material they will get to the endgame pretty soon), and some games don't even have end games (or even middle games!) if they blunder or fall in traps.

A: Quoting from rate your endgame by Edmar Mednis
"...perhaps this is clearer when approached negatively"
What does this mean? Well we know in endgames and middlegames, there are totally different plans. The most well known example is undoubtedly the Isolated Queen Pawn(IQP) case. IQP can offer dynamic chances in middlegame, but it's always a weakness in endgames. So by working retrogressively, we can know what phase we are in.
In middlegame
Better development, open file and misplaced pieces etc are crucial
In endgame
Pawn structure, availability of passed pawns, availability of weak pawns are crucial
For example
[FEN "3r1r2/1bp5/1p3k1p/pP4p1/4Pp1P/2P2P2/1P4RB/4R1K1 w - - 0 1"]

In this position, we clearly know that black has advantage, due to white's bad bishop and black's control over d-file. White, despite having a protected passed pawn and created a black backward pawn has no advantage.
Hence, we know that this position is a middlegame.
Note that there is not much mentioning of how much material must be removed before endgame starts. This is due to the fact that endgames can occur despite large amount of material on board. E.g. Queen pawn vs Queen pawn, Queen Rook Pawn vs Queen rook pawn and so on

A: There isn't a clear-cut definition of endgame, or a set of criteria where you could draw a line and say "after this move, we have reached the endgame."
Quoting Glenn Flear in his excellent book Practical Endgame Play - Beyond the Basics:

The word 'endgame' is widely used and generally implies the final phase of the game  (however long!), assuming that there already has been significant simplification.  If we had to define the word more rigorously in terms of material then opinions vary.  Some specialists consider all queenless positions to be endgames, others those where both sides have limited material, for instance less than queen and rook.

So basically, once the position becomes 'simplified' to the point where more often than not you are using your few remaining pieces (including the King) to try and queen a pawn, rather than organize an attack.  Also included would be the end result of queening a pawn (or winning significant material), i.e. positions where you mate the King with only a few pieces on the board, like King and Rook vs. King.

A: One old definition of the endgame was when the main objective is to "queen a pawn," (as opposed to other goals such as forcing an imminent checkmate).
Now there is an exception noted in the comments where one side will try to mate the other side's lone king with a king and two bishops, or a king, bishop and knight. But it's likely that one side obtained this material advantage by trying to queen extra pawns, and forcing the other side to trade pieces for them. 

A: The endgame begins when the kings can wander out from their hiding places without risking being checkmated.

A: Opening is the phase of the game where your strategic goal is to develop and you aim to build some sort of (direct or indirect) territory control: either an advantage or simply an unbalance.
Middlegame is when you start to use that territory control to achieve the next strategic goal like a direct attack (tactics is incidental here, not a purpose per se) or a conversion to a position where other strategic goals can be pursued like liquidation into a favorable ending.
Ending is either when you have built a positional/material advantage big enough and you simplify to remain in a position where you can force a win whatever defense the opponent uses, or more generally when you play to gain that advantage as main purpose.
Of course one can try gain to obtain a winning material advantage in the middlegame, but that is incidental and not the main goal one follows: material advantage is obtained, besides blunders, as consequence of/defence against some sort of direct attack.
In the endgame direct attack instead are used as threats and the main goal is as said reaching a forcefully winning positional or material advantage.

Q: When does the middlegame end and the endgame begin? Is there any specific point where the middle-game ends and end-game begins? E.g. after x number of pieces are exchanged, or say 40 moves, etc.

Wikipedia's article on the fifty-move rule states:

All of the basic checkmates can be accomplished in well under 50 moves. However, in the 20th century it was discovered that some positions of certain endgames can only be won in more than fifty moves (without a capture or a pawn move). The rule was changed to include certain exceptions in which one hundred moves were allowed with particular material combinations. However, more and more exceptions were discovered and in 1992 FIDE abolished all such exceptions and reinstated the strict fifty-move rule.

I have never seen an example of this, though I used to think the K, N, B vs. K ending was one.  When is it possible to force a win in 50 moves or more, but not less than 50 moves?

A: Yes, there are quite a few endgames that require more than 50 moves with best play from the defender.
Wikipedia has a list of material imbalances where it could take more than 50 moves depending on the specific position.  Here are a few examples:


*Rook and bishop vs lone rook (often a draw though)

*Two bishops vs a lone knight 

*Two knights vs a lone pawn (the defender must have a pawn)

*Four knights vs a lone queen (would never happen over the board…)

*Queen and rook vs queen and rook

*Two queens vs two queens


A: A more comprehensive list of endgames sorted by the number of moves it could take to mate (based on Nalimov tablebases) is at http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/longest-checkmates/longest-checkmates-sorted-by-length.shtml
These vary in length from 1 move to 262 moves.  It does not include the mate in 549 because that endgame has 7 pieces on the board and the tablebases only include positions with up to 6 pieces on the board.
As for KBN vs. K, that can be done in 33 moves.

A: The following KNN v KPP endgame position is one:

Ply count=0. Black to play. White win without 50 move rule. Draw under 50 move rule.
This is the third position in the "two knights v pawn" section of Averbakh's "Knight Endings" (Batsford edition) where it gives a White win in 17 moves, but Black's defence can be improved.

Grouping of initial moves of a chess game are well known, though I've never seen analysis of the worst possible opening move, any thoughts? If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.

A: 1. h4 has been deemed the worst move by John Watson (author of the Mastering the Chess Openings series). Other people are saying 1. h3 and 1. a3. That is not true. Michael Basman is a noted unorthodox player that opens with 1. a3/h3, etc. and is rated >2400. 1. a3/h3 come out to be useful in a variety of openings, but it's certainly not what I would start with.

A: I agree 1. f3 is quite bad, but 1. Na3 and 1. Nh3 aren't pretty either, especially as they have to move again to avoid a doubled pawn after ...d5 or ...e5.

A: 1.Nh3 and 1.Na3 (Ammonia attack, Sodium attack) are REALLY bad. It breaks the "move one piece one time" rule, and 1.Nh3 blocks h3, a good move to prevent back-rank mate.

A: I'm just trying to protect a move that's mentioned above as being perhaps one of the worst. Grandmaster Mednis years ago wrote a little opening theory book ("How to play good opening moves," Edmar Mednis, ISBN-13: 978-0679141099) in which he states that
1.g3
is one of White's perfect opening move choices, when followed by
2.Bg2.
He does mention some of White's awful first move choices, but doesn't rank their badness.

A: 1. g4 ... 2. f3??
This is a horrendous opening (especially in combination with the second move) because it severely undermines the ability to castle on the king's side, very aggressively throws a pawn into action where it has no defenders and isn't helping any cause in particular. 
g4 allows to fianchetto the light-square bishop, as well as hide the dark square bishop behind it later, if needed, which is an odd, but somewhat redeeming quality, but as soon as it's followed by 2. f3, the light-square bishop is entombed and white have ZERO center control or active development for whole 3 tempi, allowing black to gain a MASSIVE center presence and advantage. And after 1. ...d5 followed by 2. ...h5 the g4 square now belongs to the black and sets a great entry point to a king-side attack. If white tried to take on g5, black now has a semi-open file without ever moving the rook. Thanks for that! 
Such a horrible game would typically go like this: 1. g4 d5  2. f3 e5  3. Bg2 h5 - and black is 2+ points in the lead without having taken a single piece yet, according to any decent engine. White would need a major miracle and a blunder from black to have any chance to recover from that.
Example: Hou Yifan throws game

A: The idea of the opening moves is to allow an early development of pieces. Therefore the worst moves would be the ones that allow you the least opportunity to do so. So I would say 1. a3, 1. h3, and 1. f3 would be the worst. You not only lose the race in developing your pieces quickly (the only piece you can develop after these moves is the knight), but you also give up control on the central squares.

A: I would say 1. Na3.  The reason is that it is the most useless move as far as building a setup around it.  Even moves mentioned like 1. h4 and 1. f3 can be useful in some contexts - 1. f3 can be useful if you play d4 and Nc3 and plan e4.  1. h4 can be useful because you discourage your opponent from fianchettoing his bishop, and you can push it again for cramping effect.  It is difficult, however, to imagine any setup where 1. Na3 is a helpful move, and furthermore after ...e5 you will have to move the knight or play b3 to avoid getting doubled a-pawns, which are probably the worst doubled pawns since the open b-file is rarely useful and they are not supporting anything or guarding any important squares.

A: 1. f3 is almost certainly the single worst move.  It irrevocably weakens white's king position without doing anything useful.  
Other moves like 1. b3 and 1. g3 prepare to develop a bishop, so they're not so bad.  1. c3 doesn't do too much for white, but it also doesn't hurt him.
1. a4 and 1. h4 both ignore the center, but they do help develop the rooks, and there are positions where 1. a4/h4 can be useful (especially when the kings have castled on opposite sides of the board.

Q: What is the worst opening move, and why? Grouping of initial moves of a chess game are well known, though I've never seen analysis of the worst possible opening move, any thoughts? If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.

A: I would say 1. Nh3. 
1.f3 is bad however after g3 white is only down a couple of tempos and has a somewhat reasonable position. 
1.Nh3 allows black the potential to to wreck white's pawn structure and even threaten a very quick mate. Yes, white can avoid that with Ng4->Nf3 but you've wasted two tempos when you could have done the same thing with 1.Nf3  
White is in a struggle for equality after 1.Nh3 and is one slip away from losing the game for the next several moves. Even if white does play perfectly, he has thrown away several tempi for no reason and allowed an equal game. 

A: 1.f3
PROS
The only pros of the opening is some small center support.
CONS

*

*This opening weakens the king's safety. The f pawn is an important shelter of the e1-h4 diagonal and the g1-b7 diagonal so moving it makes the kingside pawn structure destroyed.

*This opening don't open any lines fo development, and it blocked the knight!

*Wasted tempo.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
I do not suggest it for anyone
1.h4 and 1.a4
PROS
None
CONS

*

*Doesn't open any lines nor development.

*Weakens pawn structure.

*Wasted tempo.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
I do not suggest it for anyone
1.h3 and 1.a3
PROS
Does not weaken anything.
CONS

*

*Wasted tempo.

*No development lines.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
For white players who want to play black.
1.Na3
PROS

*

*It can develop to c4 or c2 but that would waste some tempos.

*Support c pawn, but can't the c pawn move already?

CONS

*

*After 1...d5 and an exchange the pawn structure is lost.

*Wasted tempo.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
Only in blitz.
1.Nh3
PROS

*

*It can use another tempo to go to f4.

*I'm surprised at nobody mentioning it, but it protects f2!

CONS

*

*Wasted tempo

*After 1...e5 and exchange the pawn structure is lost... and the f2 protection is gone!

SUGGESTIONS FOR PLAYING
Only in blitz.
1.c3
PROS
Support d4
CONS

*

*No development and blocks knight

*Wasted tempo.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
For Caro Kann players.
1.g4
PROS
Open lines for bishop development
CONS

*

*The g pawn is undefended.

*Weakens kingside.

SUGGESTION FOR PLAYING
Only in blitz.
The third most bad is 1.Na3?! and 1.Nh3?!
The second most bad is 1.h4?! and 1.a4?!
The most bad is 1.f3?!

A: I agree with Andrew on 1. f3 (Barnes Opening).  No first move can be decisively wrong, but some first moves are questionable.  In Chess Opening Theory (Wikibooks):

Quite a rarely played passive starting move that gives up White's first move advantage. White's position is slightly weakened by the White King exposure to a check on the h4 - e1 diagonal. The kingside Knight's favourite developing square f3, is also not currently possible. In fact, this is arguably the worst possible first move by White.
No stats as 1. f3 occurs rarely among serious chess players.

Next on the list would probably be 1. h4 (Desprez Opening):

1. h4 is a rather useless move that does nothing to assist the important central squares. No top masters have ever used it in professional play, although some, most notably Hikaru Nakumura, play it during blitz. It could be said that White has made his position worse, as castling kingside is now less attractive.
This move is rarely seen among serious chess players.


Q: What is the worst opening move, and why? Grouping of initial moves of a chess game are well known, though I've never seen analysis of the worst possible opening move, any thoughts? If so, please provide more than just a move, but the exact reason why such a move would be the worst assuming such a move was against a GM.

A: Just tell you one thing, 1.f3 is bad, it does not control the center actually, it stopped the knight, and it place the king in danger. Sometimes even followed by 2.Kf2, I think this is the hammerschlag variation, further weakening the king, this is to laugh at beginners, but no one have win me with it yet. 

A: The other moves cited, especially 1.f3, are bad, but I would rather plead the case of the ugly Grob opening, 1.g4?.
Pawns do not go back, so this double step weakening is much more committing than a one step pawn move. After, say 1...e5, White has not only lost time, he has also:


*Self-destroyed the most natural shelter for his own king, reached by short castle.

*created weaknesses for himself, as Pg4 can and will be targeted by Bc8 or Ph5.

*got himself a disadvantage in the fight for the center.

If, in some kind of handicapped game, I could choose my opponent's first move in order to maximize my chances, I would rather force him to play 1.g4 than anything else.

A: For an objective take on this question, one might take a look at the Chessok Opening Tree:

*

*1.f3 -0.33

*1.g4 -0.29

*1.Nh3 -0.22

*1.b4 -0.18

*1.h4 -0.18

Given that white should be able to achieve a plus of 0.11 (according to the Tree) these are the only moves that not only lose the first move advantage but more than reverse it.
Of course these computer evaluations have to be taken with a grain of salt, but they do bear out the intuition of experienced players and provide some food for thought (especially to adherents of the Sokolski …).

A: The worst move is 1. resigns. It goes from equal to lost in one move, much worse than moves like 1. f3 which go from equal to slightly worse.

Assuming a player knows the rules, are there any free, one-player simulations that will rapidly teach a single player on their own how to move beyond opening with nonsense moves. 

A: The concept that caused me to stop making nonsense moves is control the center.
That meant moving out the d and e pawns, possibly with the c and f pawns, either abreast, or in support. More likely, I'd move a knight to c3 or f3 (c6 or f6 if Black), then a bishop or two. Castle as soon as possible, before undertaking activities on the wings.
That eliminated a lot of bad opening moves like b3, g3, and worse, a4 and h4.

A: In the area of openings, I don't think a one-player simulation will serve you as well as a good read. For a start, I would suggest the Wikibook Chess Opening Theory, perhaps after reading the more basic version.
Of course, experience playing with others will strengthen your opening a good deal, once you have the principles down.

A: I'd be careful of the word 'nonsense' since it means different things to different people.  Kasparov would consider nonsense things that you or I would consider totally groovy.
I think a player can learn the main lines of a few openings and learn the basic principles behind those moves (occupy the center, develop pieces...) in not too much time.
How long before you can find the correct response to the 10th move of a sharp variation of the Ruy Lopez?  Perhaps a bit longer.

A: Open with 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. g3, 4. Bg2 and then do whatever you want.  By that point, it's hard to find nonsense moves that aren't obviously nonsense.  Finding the best move is very difficult, but if you're a beginner you don't need to worry about it.

A: Pick ONE opening and specialise in it.  Do not worry about any other openings. For black that is a bit harder but you can find sound defenses to limit how much you need to know. 
Play over GM games with that opening.  Play every one you can find.  Be totally familiar with all the usual variations and how the middle games turned out.

Pre-AI, it's hard to imagine that opening moves had changed much. Following the birth of computer engines, has AI changed opening theory, and if so, how? 

A: AI has changed theory by allowing theoreticians to grind through variations tirelessly.  Due to the tactical prowess of even common computer programs it's pretty easy to ensure that variations contain no unexpected barbs.

A: I would say not yet. I would think what is called AI (it is not actually AI but that's a different discussion) has made some people question how they approach chess and maybe led to some ideas but I wouldn't say AI has made any significant contributions to theory.
When matches are held between traditional engines and AI engines they are held in conditions that greatly favor the AI engine. Traditional engines are still way ahead. AI is just the cool new thing.

A: I don't know that it's 95%, but it's close.
Why aren't there more female players?  Probably a combination of things certainly including cultural gender bias.  Women can surely play the game but American culture doesn't seem to reward them for it.
In about 1990, my B-player rating would have put me in the top 50 women players in the country.  A little later, the US got a lot of immigration from ex-Soviet Bloc countries.  This included a very good number of strong female players.  I can only surmise that their cultures were more supportive of the women. 
Further, I feel the game was invented as a war game by men for men and as such probably has a certain character that is best appreciated by men.
Compare to Go, a game of remarkable complexity, which has a much higher level of female participation.

A: Among active players in the United States, about 15% seem to be women.
If you look at the rankings on this page, there are currently 9513 women active out of 64634 total players. That's 14.7%.
My guess is that the composition of female players skews more heavily towards juniors than the composition of male players, but I didn't find any numbers on that. I say this because I saw more female players at scholastic tournaments as a child than I do now at open tournaments as an adult.

A: 
I have recently heard that the only 5% percent out of entire chess
  players are women.

In 2018 this is certainly false. The statistics from the November 2018 FIDE rating list are that there are 668785 active players of whom 99325 are female. That is a female participation rate of about 15%.
Update January 2020: The statistics from the January 2020 FIDE rating list are that there are 771484 active players of whom 120065 are female. That is a female participation rate of about 15.6%.
The statistics from the May 2012 FIDE list (when you wrote this question) are that were 87538 active players of whom 7226 were female. That is a female participation rate of 8.25%. So even when you wrote this question your number was inaccurate.
The big difference between May 2012 and today in FIDE rating terms is that the current figures also include rapid and blitz and also FIDE's online Arena for online chess. FIDE rating of rapid and blitz only started with the July 2012 list and has grown massively since then. I believe the FIDE online Arena only started in late 2015.
One other factor also affects the figures and that is that the FIDE default when a new player is recorded is male. If the registering federation does not specify sex then the player is registered as male. This obviously introduces distortions in the figures. It should be noted that FIDE has made great efforts in more recent times to clean up its data and correct errors. More recent FIDE data is more accurate than older data.
Now I don't know which federation you come from so your figure could be accurate for your federation even though it is inaccurate overall.
Figures vary wildly by federation and not necessarily in the way that you might imagine (unless you listen to Jordan Peterson). 
Looking at the female participation rate (100 x active female players / active players for federations with 100 or more active players) gives these 10 federations as bottom of the list from the May 2012 list -
Czech Republic - 4%
Spain - 3.9%

Here are the corresponding figures from the November 2018 list (restricted to federations with 1000 or more active players - about 10x as many active players so increase the "noise" filter by 10x).

Who says that only men can play chess?

Nobody says that and the statistics certainly don't say that either. What they do suggest is that men want to play chess much more than women. Where women have a greater choice of what sort of things they can do, as in the Scandinavian countries, it appears that many more of them have better things to do with their time than play chess ;-).
PS It's a shame there isn't an international knitting federation publishing data we could use to extract male participation rates in knitting.
NB For anybody interested in the raw data, FIDE publish rating file data going back to 2001. For data before 2001 there is the Olimpbase site, but their data is very "dirty" and will need a lot of work to eliminate/merge duplicates and correct obviously false data before it can be used.

Q: Is it true that Chess is generally more played by men? I have recently heard that the only 5% percent out of entire chess players are women. I find this suspicious. Who says that only men can play chess? Is this statistic true, and if it is, why?

A: Chess tends to impersonate war.
No one says women can't fight, but it's usually considered (culturally) as more of a men's activity, don't you think ?
I'm very curious about the “why” aspect myself, but that probably calls for much socio-psychology I'm not near knowledgeable enough at, and probably isn't even well known yet, not to mention far from the scope of this site.
For real statistics, I guess scripting over a FIDE ratings database wouldn't be too hard, probably even mentioned in the introductory section of Women in Chess.
Most people (and other answers) cite a 5-15% figure.

A: Despite all feminist claims, it's not cultural, but biological.  In countries where supposedly the culture is more supportive for equality in activities (like USSR), males are by far relatively predominant in chess, the same as in US.  It's the same with careers.  It hasn't made much of a difference now that engineering, for instance, has been a field accessible to women for a long time.  Most of them simply prefer social activities more.  As Desmond Morris says, the brains of men and women work differently from each other.  This doesn't imply any inferiority, simply there are activities more suited for men and activities more suited for women.  E.g. dyslexia is almost wholly an issue for men, not for women.

How can I break the King's Indian Attack? I think my h7 square is vulnerable to attack; what is the best way to break this strategy?

A: I doubt that the King's Indian Attack can be 'broken'.  It's a very solid position that White takes the time to setup, if Black is not careful, White may be able to gain space on the kingside, with moves such as e5, and develop dangerous attacks if Black has castled there.
As for h7 being weak, many things need to happen from Black in order for this to be realized (such as a semi-open h-file, Bg7 has been exchanged, in which case it is h6 that is weaker), so there may not be anything there worth exploring.
I can't comment on what the 'best' defense would be, but there are many good ones, one such is the Botvinnik System.  Black makes use of the extra available tempi to set up a strong and flexible defense.  The typical structure would be pawns at c5, e5, d6, g6 and pieces at Nc6, Nge7, Bg7 and 0-0.  Black has a firm control over the d4 square and can potentially break with either ...b5 or ...f5.

A: I recently faced a very similar problem when I organized a King's Indian Attack themed blitz tournament at my club. The problem is that it takes quite a few moves to establish White's KIA position and I had to find moves for black that preserved Black's flexibility in light of the many Youtube videos out there that promise to "crush Black with the KIA" :-).
The solution I came up with was to follow a line recommended by England's "Ginger GM", Simon Williams in his series of videos on the French Defence. It goes like this:
[fen ""]
1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 Nc6 5. g3 g6 6. Bg2 Bg7 7. O-O Nge7 8. Re1 b6

There are a number of ideas here.


*

*The King's knight has gone to e7 not f6. This is important because it takes the sting out of e5 by White and of ed. The e file is blocked by the knight on e7 and Black's king sheltered.   

*Black has delayed castling. There is no urgency and castling queenside may be more appropriate. In any case don't castle automatically into the programmed KIA king's side attack. Make your opponent think! Try and frustrate his plans.   

*Black is ready to meet ed with ed and O-O. If necessary then a5, Ra7 will redeploy the queenside rook along the 7th rank opening up new defensive and attacking possibilities.   

*Black will meet e5 with moves like Qc7 and g5 with the idea of exchanging his g pawn for White's e pawn and if White defends with Qe2 Black will happily initiate the exchange of queens on e5. Black is more likely to castle queenside in this variation   

*If White follows a traditional move order with moves like c3, Nf1 h5 etc then Black will respond with something like h6, a5, Ra7, Rd7 with threats to play either de to embarrass the White queen or d4 to drive a wedge into the center and take space.


Of course this does not refute the KIA but it does give a flexible and rich way to combat White players who bang out the first 10 or 12 moves like an automaton.

A: So far, I’ve had success with the Pachman System, d5 g6 Bg7 e5 Ne7. If they play d4 before you can get the e5 off, you can go for Nf6, Nd7, and Nb6, allowing you to capture any c4 pawn, and get a good position while they recapture.

A: I believe that the best way is to stop your opponent from getting an imbalance by copying White's setup. This will lead to drawish positions, if you are aiming for a draw. If you are aiming for a win, then you should then control the center after these moves.

I am interested in retrograde analysis problems, where the question usually is: 'What was the last move made?' or 'Where did the piece stand on the board before it fell from the table?'  etc. Currently I know of only two occurrences of retrograde chess analysis to have found its way into fictional literature. One is Arturo Pérez-Reverte's "The Flanders Panel", the other is Raymond M. Smullyan's "Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes". The latter is not even a real novel, but retrograde chess problems presented in story format, so I am not sure whether I should have included it in my list.
Do you know of any other fictional work using retrograde chess problems as an important element?

A: There is The Flanders Panel, a crime novel written in 1990 by best-selling Spanish author Arturo
Pérez-Reverte.
The plot revolves around an old painting, where a chess position between two players appears incidentally in the background. Upon close inspection the position reveals mysterious things that I won't spoil.

A: There's also A Happy Solution by Raymond Allen.  It's a short story (under 6000 words), but quaint. It appeared in The Strand Magazine in 1916.
The puzzle featured in Allen's tale was posted here in Chess.com's forums:
[FEN "2BK3N/NP1P1PPb/P4P2/3p1q2/1Q1P1b2/1pB1p1p1/p1p2pp1/1kr4r w - - 0 1"]

While Chess.com's puzzle is set up for Black to force mate, it is also the board that Kenneth Dale did a retrograde analysis on.  The game was between Sir James Winslay and Lord Churt.  When a banknote was found to have been pilfered, Churt's secretary Gornay was remembered to have been watching the game, but no one could vouch for how long.  Gornay's innocence appeared inviolate, as he was also remembered to have made several remarks on some of the past moves of the game at its conclusion:

"If the play was rather eccentric sometimes, I must say it was bold and dashing enough on both sides," Gornay commented. "For instance, when Lord Churt gave up his knight for nothing, and when you gave him the choice of taking your queen with either of two pawns at your queen's knight's sixth." He turned to Churt. "Possibly you might have done better to take the queen with the bishop's pawn instead of with the rook's."

After this, the missing note was found in the wrong envelope, and Dale suspected that Gornay may have been the one who had moved the note, in order to frame Dale in case of the note's being found.

"Was he in the library all the time you were playing?" Kenneth asked.
"I can't say that," Churt replied. "I don't think he was. I didn't notice particularly. But I am positive that he did not enter or leave the room while I was standing looking at Winslade's move, and he must have been there when Winslade offered his queen and when I took it, because he was commenting on those very moves after the game was finished, and suggesting that I might have done better to take with the other pawn. You heard him yourself."

Dale later proved that Gornay could have figured out those previous moves simply by looking at the resigned game, and therefore had been free to leave the room and do his dirty work while the game was still underway.

A: [TITLE "chess position from The Flanders Panel book"]
[FEN "1nb5/pp1p4/PRP5/pR6/k1K1P3/2P5/2qP1P2/1NrnQB2 w - - 0 1"]

For the retro logic in the "The Flanders Panel" to work, there are two assumptions required: (1) there were no promotions (2) the black queen was royal, i.e. could not have been left exposed to attack. The solvers also assume that it was Black who moved last: perhaps there is some clue mentioned in the painting (e.g. Ferdinand of Ostenburg pushing the chess clock :D). If you accept those conditions, then the retro logic works out OK, in what is a well-written &amp; atmospheric historical thriller.
It is so much better than the corresponding composition in the movie of the book, renamed "Uncovered", and starring Kate Beckinsale. The diagram is:  
[TITLE "chess position from Uncovered movie"]
[FEN "2n1r1k1/bQ2p1r1/p4p1q/6pp/1P5P/R5PK/2BR4/4N3 w - - 0 1"]

The retroanalysis is simply bonkers, but most of the analysis concerns the forward play, in what is initially a balanced position, but which is thrown away by the "expert" player representing White in a series of moves not much better than those in "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  
The total blunder 1.Ra5? is played in the movie (Stockfish prefers 1.Qd7!) 1...g4+! 2.Kh2! Qxd2+! 3.Qg2? (3.Ng2!) 3...Qxb4? (3...Qxe1!) 4.Qc6? (4.Ra1!) and Stockfish rates the position -9.9.
In one of the chess scenes (in the park) the diagram position is actually wrong, with bKa8 instead of g8, and wQ missing!  
Amazing that in a movie which is ostensibly about a chess position, that no-one bothered to invest $50 in a competent chess player to sort the thing out properly!

What happens? Especially in blitz or bullet games, it is possible that a player makes an illegal move, for example castles through check. 


*If the opponent does notice the illegal move, then as far as I know the first player is obliged to make a legal move with the same piece, if one exists. What if there are no legal moves? 

*What if the opponent, being in time pressure, doesn't notice the illegal move and makes a move. What happens after they realize that? Does the person who made the illegal move forfeit? Or is the whole game cancelled?

Are there any standard rules for these kinds of situations?

A: This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).
In a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.
Then, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute "bonus" is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.
Here is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:

11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.
11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).

In blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.
Because blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.
At no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.

A: 
A player who makes an illegal move must retract that move and make a
  legal move. That move must be made with the same piece if possible,
  because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an
  attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to
  the rook. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to
  the best evidence. If the mistake is only noticed later on, the game
  should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred
  (Schiller 2003:24–25). Some regional organizations have different
  rules.
If blitz chess is being played (in which both players have a small,
  limited time, e.g. five minutes) the rule varies. A player may correct
  an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock. If a player
  has pressed their clock, the opponent may claim a win if he or she
  hasn't moved. If the opponent moves, the illegal move is accepted and
  without penalty (Schiller 2003:77).

Is the number 50 chosen carefully?

A: 
At one time, it was believed that all winnable endgames could be won
  within fifty moves. However, in the early twentieth century, some
  exceptions were found, including A. A. Troitsky's (1866-1942) analysis
  of the two knights endgame as well as the endgame of a rook and bishop
  versus a rook. The rules of chess were revised several times to admit
  exceptions to the fifty-move rule for certain specific situations.
  Early on, the fifty-move rule applied to tournament games but not to
  match games (Troitzky 2006:197).

What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?
How much time do you spend on analyzing the game?
Are there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?

A: Game analysis is important (both your own &amp; other people's games).
I usually use some computer software-I am not great analysing only from a game scoresheet.
(if so I would try &amp; make sure I had a board setup in front of me-but the computer chess software is very handy).
I have Fritz9 / Winboard / BabasChess and a variety of chess engines. I usually use these for my game analysis.
It can also be very helpful to have a chess coach or other good player look over the game with you to get another opinion.
Game analysis to start with is not easy but like most skills you can get better at it with practice and it can help you learn from your mistakes and successes-good luck with your chess analysis! :-)

A: I think that the point in analysing your games is to point out in what conditions you are inclined to make a mistake (not necessarily a blunder, but also a sub-optimal move).
You do not study your games to improve your chess knowledge (for that you have to study Grand Masters games), but to improve your approach to the game.
Try to determine common situations in your games, give them a name and try to find a kind of behaviour to tackle them.
Just an example:
Unexpected move: this is when your opponent made a move you did not expect and you notice that you lost confidence and you made a suicidal move to find counterplay. 
Then in your analysis you find out that your position was not lost at all!
It was you that reacted badly in that kind of situation. Take note of it.
The next time this situation arises, try to stay calm and be aware that usually a mistake is followed by a worst one in order to avoid it.
There are hundreds of situations like this that you have to find out yourself.
Create your kind of chess theory if you want to improve.

A: I would focus on the "turning points" of the game. That is, I had a good game until I made move X. If, instead, I had made move Y or Z at that point, what would have been the result? 
The idea is to discover your mistakes, first the most obvious ones, then the less obvious, and try to avoid them in future games.

A: Engine analysis can take care of the tactical bloopers, it is usually the strategic plans and more human stuff that is hard to figure out even for strong players, and Andrew's advice should help in that regard. 
About the openings however, I believe it was Edmar Mednis who mentioned that 50% of the time should be spent studying openings, and it is not just about memorizing lines but also about the associated motifs extending to the middlegame and possibly into the endgame for openings like the Spanish Exchange and Berlin. Examining opening moves with only an engine can be tricky as the playable candidate moves usually do not differ beyond one-third of a pawn (or roughly thirty centipawns) or even up to half a pawn, which means almost nothing to a human player. Cross checking the main lines with books and games between strong players is definitely more important here.

A: Analyzing your own games is the best and fastest way to improve in my opinion.  
As soon as possible after the game, write down the variations that you were thinking about during the game, especially the ones that were not played.  This will be useful when you come back to the game after days, months, or even years.  As you improve, it will be helpful to see what you were thinking during the game.  That way, you can pinpoint how you can improve your thought process in future games.
When you start analyzing, use a chess board, but don't use an engine at first.  Look for moves where you made a mistake or missed something important.  If you lost material, go back and find the moment where you blundered.  If you got into a bad position, try to identify the moves that led to that position and evaluate some alternatives.  Put everything you come up with into your chess program/database (you are using some kind of a database, right?).
After you've gone over the game "by hand" (this should take at least half an hour for a slow game, even more time if it was a complicated position), now it's time to use a chess engine.  Go through all of the moves and take note of where the engine says that you either made a poor move or missed an opportunity for a better move.  Again, add variations to your database.  If it's not clear why something that the engine suggests is good, investigate it further.  Try out some lines and see what the engine says.  
At this point, you have an awful lot of moves in front of you.  Now it's time to try to take away some lessons from the game.  Go back through the game again and decide what specific thing you could have done better.  Did you make a very poor positional move?  Did you blunder material?  Did you neglect development?  Did you put a piece on a bad square?  Asking questions like this will help you in future games during the game.  
The last thing that you can do is to ask a stronger player for help.  Bring all of the information you have to the stronger player and then go through the game once more.  The stronger player can give you suggestions for how to think in certain positions.  Basically, a chess engine can tell you what the right move is, but a stronger player is often needed to tell you why a move is correct.  
You should try to develop your own analysis style as well.  If you are a strong tactical player, try to go through the game without making moves on the board, just analyze in your head.  If you are good at endgames, switch colors and analyze where your opponent went astray in the endgame.  Hopefully analyzing games is fun and not a chore!

Additional thoughts
I didn't mention studying the opening moves because that is less important than finding the specific points in the game where you made a mistake.  After you have looked at the game as a whole, studying the opening can often help you as well.  The best way to do this is to look for grandmaster games in the same opening that was played.  Find out what moves are commonly played, and then go through some games of stronger players in order to find good, general plans for the opening.  Try to see where you varied from these plans and determine why you didn't do what the stronger player did.  This is much more important than memorizing moves (although you will probably find that you've memorized many variations just as a matter of course!).

Q: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?
How much time do you spend on analyzing the game?
Are there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?

A: Here are my 2 cents in addition to the already well-written answers:
Start your analysis during your games instead of after. It really helps remember the critical points of the game rather than trying to recall them later (you're likely to not immediately start analyzing your game after a round finishes...). This will save you both time and effort. Here's how:


*

*Mark moves where you took more time than usual (Do the same for your opponent's moves!).

*Mark the point where you got out of opening theory (that you knew at that point), and check later with an opening database whether you played the next few moves accurately.

*Mark the point where you got out of your comfort zone (when did the complications begin? when did your opponent sac a piece on you? etc.).

*Refrain from giving ?s and !s on the scoresheet during your game (unless you want to use it as a psychological tactic against your opponent).

*If there was a time when you wanted to attempt a tactical shot, but didn't; mark it as well, so that you can check later for its soundness. (I use an inverted "T" (for Tal) to mark such moves :P )
Doing this takes little time, and saves a LOT of time during post game analysis. Good luck!

A: The goal of analyzing a game is to understand what happened in the game, step by step. Following Kasparov's advice, you should analyze all your games, regardless of the final result (loss, draw or win). The point is that it is tempting to only analyze your losses, because you think that these are the games that reveal your weak spots. While in reality, your wins could be covering up some even more serious flaws that will continue haunting your future games.
Nowadays, analysis involves the usage of a chess engine. The ideal analysis is as follows. First, you analyze with your opponent after the game. You go through the whole game and find the critical moments and share your thoughts about these positions. Taking a few notes during this process is a very good idea. Next, you get home and enter the game in your personal database over your games on the computer. Then, you step through the game with an engine (e.g. Rybka) running to find the key moments by looking at evaluation jumps. You compare these with the moments you discussed with your opponent, to check your own understanding. You can make notes and include them in the game file. Done!

Q: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?
How much time do you spend on analyzing the game?
Are there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?

A: All analysis (as Gaul) is divided into three parts:


*

*During and immediately after the game

*Annotation after the game

*Computer engine checking


Step one has been covered fairly well by the above posters, but to reiterate:


*As you write the moves, mark moves which took you a long time to make

*If you have space/time write down any variations you are considering

*Write down any moves of your opponent which you feared (especially if they weren't played)

*Always do a post-mortem (preferably with your opponent, or even better, a stronger player) and do it ASAP; write down any new ideas/variations

Step two was also fairly covered but for the sake of being thorough, involves going over your variations and all the work you did during the game, looking for mistakes. 


*Look at positions where you took a long time and see if you can justify the time taken for the move made.

*If you spot tactical combinations which you missed in the game, save the position as FEN (explained below). 

*Look up the opening and if possible, look at middlegame plans for that opening (if you can't find it in a book, look at GM games and try to extrapolate).

*Focus on the things that caused you to lose and then learn the info necessary to cure that weakness (e.g you lost a drawn R vs P endgame, learn that endgame; you fell into an opening trap, learn that opening etc.)

Step three is where I think some of the advice falls short. 


*Computers should not be used to analyze the game, they should be used to analyze your annotations. 

Essentially the computer is a purely objective machine, if you use it to analyze games it may give you crazy variations which are objectively good but which have you sweating buckets. Instead, you use the computer make sure your analysis is objective (i.e, free of calculation errors, bias, etc.). When the computer analyzes the game you should only use that information to supplement your existing analyses (not replace it). 


*One other thing that can be done with computers that hasn't been mentioned is playing "won" positions (from your games) against the engine. Do it from increasingly smaller margins of victory (up a whole piece, the exchange, two pawns, 1 pawn, 1/2 pawn) and watch as your ability to the convert the point becomes GM-level

EDIT: Forgot to add a few things:


*The reason you save the missed tactics as a FEN string is to create an Anki flashcard of that position for subsequent review and memorization. Anki is an extremely powerful tool for drilling those tactics and positions you want to completely memorize

*Don't forget the point of analysis which is to improve your understanding of the game. Make sure that you have a list of conclusions/"things learned" from every game that you analyze. It seems kind of trivial, but having such things in writing makes them that much more concrete


A: I'd have to disagree with @andrew about analyzing ones' own games.  The reason is, I'm a B-player. I make B-player moves. I perform B-player analysis. That's insufficient. Spending precious time to produce weak analysis is inefficient.
This may offend people.  But consider - if you had to make a home repair and you didn't know how, would you just figure it out on the spot or would you seek an expert/education to make you smarter? If you needed to shingle your roof, would you just get up there and start hammering? Or would you refer to several how-tos and learn a little first?  Maybe you'd talk to your brother-in-law who's a contractor?
Instead, I start with the engine, on a setting that I cannot beat.  This is analogous to have an instructor or how-to book.
I key the game into the engine and let it analyze each move (both sides.) If the computer produces a move and the score deviates too much (for me, a half a point), I stop to determine why the computer chooses a different move.  Then I work to understand how the computer's move prevents situation the caused by my move.

A: in principle you should look at the game yourself without a computer, then go over with coach, then with computer.
For real life :
A. enter the game into computer without engine straight after game, write down all the things you saw and thought that you can remember.
B.enter the game into lichess.org, tell it to auto analyse. cover up the engine's suggestions by pressing one of the menu options on the right hand side.
Press your mouse on the spot on the graph (see image) just before each big turning point (aka blunder) and solve as a puzzle!

A is optional if you are really lazy :)

Q: How do I analyze my game after playing? What techniques do you use to analyze your games or other people's games?
How much time do you spend on analyzing the game?
Are there any tools (electronic or manual, such as a piece of paper) you use during analysis?

A: You have to have a certain degree of ability before you gain a lot from analysing your own games.
Certain points you can discover by yourself, but is it just a move or two, or is your whole plan bad? Often you'll not be able to answer that on your own. You can guess, but your guess isn't likely to be that much more reliable than your play in the original game. You'll learn from your own games faster if you find a stronger player to look at them with you.
If you can't do that and have to do it on your own, here's a suggested program:
Play through the game, observing it like a movie. Don't launch yourself into deep thinks. On this pass you're only looking for obvious tactical blunders, so spend only a couple of seconds looking for ways you could have lost or won material. Note them down somewhere for further analysis later. Reset the board.
Play through the game again, five moves at a time. Every five moves stop and ask yourself which side is better, if any. Mark that evaluation on the sheet. Watch, and when that evaluation changes, somebody made a mistake; go back and look through those five moves to see if you can find it. Maybe you can't, but if you can (and you've found it only if you find an alternative that maintains the evaluation) circle the move that caused the change.
Only after that should you fire up a computer to look at the game. Right now, you're checking your own conclusions against the computer. Walk the computer through the game, comparing its evaluations with your own. If they're different, spend 10 minutes or less finding out why (it's rarely productive to spend more than 10 minutes on things like this). If you can't, mark it and go on.
What you're looking for here is whether your evaluations agree with the machine, and most especially if you and the machine pick the same "turning points" in the game. You're trying to correct your thinking here, train yourself to evaluate positions better.
If, after the end of this exercise you still don't understand the computer's evaluations of some positions, set the position up and play 5-10 games against the computer, starting from that position and taking first one side and then the other from that position and see what happens. Let the computer show you what it sees, and try your ideas against it. Learn to implement the ideas and evaluations you're learning.
But seriously, the best training games to analyse are games by players a couple of classes higher than you. If you're a C/D player, Carlsen's games aren't going to do you a lot of good; that's like a a guitarist that can manage three chords trying to learn from listening to Segovia; improvement is possible, but not all that likely. A D player can much more readily understand how to play like a B player than like a Grandmaster; it's like steps in a stairway.
