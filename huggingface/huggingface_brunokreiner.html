through the trees and the voices of those who stand looking ooh it makes me wonder ooh really makes me wonder and it s whispered that soon if we all call the tune then the piper will lead us to reason and a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forests will echo with laughter oh oh oh oh woahhh if there s a bustle in your hedgerow don t be alarmed now it s just a spring clean for the may queen yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run there s still time to change the road you re on  and it makes me wonder ohh woah your head is humming and it won t go in case you don t know the piper s calling you to join him dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know your stairway lies on the whispering wind and as we wind on down the road our shadows taller than our soul there walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold and if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last when all are one and

		Dataset Summary
	</span>
</h3>
<p>This dataset consists of roughly 480k english (classified using nltk language classifier) lyrics with some more meta data. The id corresponds to the spotify id. The meta data was taken from the million playlist challenge @ AICrowd. The lyrics were crawled using "[song name] [artist name]" as string using the lyricsgenius python package which uses the genius.com search function. There is no guarantee that the lyrics are correct because the search is not perfect. And the data cleaning is not perfect: </p>

		Data cleaning:
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The data was first verified by using fuzzy matching since the first strings of the retrieved lyrics were always the song name itself + "Lyrics" (e.g. "HelloLyrics"). When the song names in the API request and in the resulting payload don't match, it wasn't included in this set of lyrics. This was done using the package fuzzywuzzy partial_ratio() string matching with a score of under 60, because partial_ratio() is still helpful for variants of the song like "Remix" or "feat. x" and 60 was deemed a good number for some edge cases. One special edge case was manually removed which were "This is x" lyrics which were special lyrics pages describing an artist (if a song has "this is" in it, the check will fail). Next, the song is checked whether it contains one of the key words "instrument", "non-lyric", "effect", "musical", "ambient", "vocal" and whether it is less than 25 words. These songs are classified as instrumentals and are not included.
Lastly, the following regex is applied: </p>
