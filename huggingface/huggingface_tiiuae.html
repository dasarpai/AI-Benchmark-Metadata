But in case you will the episode on your television set at home , just follow through the link here to watch survivor redemption island season 22 episode 11 a mystery package online for free at anyhotstuff.com\nHere’s some sort or recaps and tidbits for last week’s episode: 5. Rice Capades – I don’t really know where to begin with talking about Phillip this week. I know that I certainly don’t want to use the c-word to describe Phillip’s behavior. However, through all of the histrionics in this episode, one thing is clear: You can no longer make the argument that Phillip is playing a game with any sort of strategy.\nPhillip told us last week that his intention was to get Boston Rob to want Phillip next to him at the end of the game. However, at this point Phillip is not showing any signs that winning this game is his objective at all. Phillip is certainly entitled to having an opinion and feeling the way he does but part of being a good Survivor player is occasionally hiding your feelings in the interests of winning the game. Phillip’s aggressive behavior has all but assured himself a zero percent chance at the million dollars. Even if Phillip makes it to the final three, he would need five votes to win the game. Considering that there will likely be five Zapatera tribe members on the jury, this incident is going to stick to Phillip like a certain color on rice.\n4. The Great Divide – Besides for Phillip, I think the most unique thing about this season of Survivor is the lack of a merge. Oh, it technically happened, but this is the only season of Survivor I can remember where the merged tribe not only has a separate alliance but separate shelters and separate food rations too. Actually, this isn’t that uncommon, I know a lot of people in bad marriages who live the same way. The big question going forward will be how much will the Zapateras hold Boston Rob accountable for being shut out to this degree? Phillip has done a lot to take the heat off of Rob but don’t be surprised if at the end of the game, the Zapatera tribe continues to act as a group and completely vote together for whomever treated them best – which is why I maintain one of the three Ometepe women have a great shot to win this game.\n3. Saving Sheppard – This season, I have spent much more time breaking down Boston Rob’s decisions in the game than any of the other players. In my opinion, Rob has far more control in this game than any other Survivor may have had at this point in history. Since Rob is controlling the vote, did Rob make the right move by keeping Phillip this week? On the one hand, he realizes that getting rid of Phillip would end a lot of the drama around camp and may even create some goodwill among the remaining Zapateras. Instead, Rob chose to keep Phillip around for another week and I agree with his decision. Phillip Sheppard is the best thing that happened to Boston Rob this season because Phillip’s distractions keep everybody from thinking about the game. When Phillip is going off about rice, feathers or kung fu, nobody is ever asking themselves about their position in the tribe or some big move they’re going to make – and that’s exactly how Boston Rob wants it to be.\n2. Tribal Counseling – It was no surprise that the feud between Phillip and Steve spilled over in to this week’s tribal council. I thought that Jeff Probst showed why he is the best host on television by exploring both sides of the debate. What I still don’t understand is what happened to Phillip’s shirt? Has there ever been a Survivor contestant to attend tribal council topless before? Now with Julie gone the prospects seem pretty slim that Phillip will ever find his bathing suit. Phillip now can only hope to win a reward at some point to find the first clue to the hidden bathing suit.\n1. Three’s Company – This week we had our first ever three-way duel on Redemption Island, which ended in Mike and Matt moving on and David getting eliminated. I think the top 2 people advancing at Redemption Island seems like it would help Matt in his quest to return to the game since it seems unlikely he would ever come in last (unless the duel involved having a strategy of some sort). Unfortunately, it looks like Redemption Island is starting to really take its toll on Matt. In Matt’s prayers he says that he doesn’t want to be on Survivor anymore but is simply carrying out God’s will. You would think that having an extra person on Redemption Island might help cheer Matt up a little bit, but apparently Mike Chisel isn’t that great of a roommate.\nWhat you waiting for, watch Survivor: Redemption Island season 22 Episode 11 a Mystery Package Survivor: Redemption Tropical isle Year twenty-two Event 11: We all Can’t stand A lot of our Tribe is currently approaching globally regarding tv set landscape an important subject due to this usually are We all Dislike Much of our Tribe.

Survivor is an American version of this Survivor reality television sport show, itself derived from the Swedish television series Journey Robinson originally created in 1997 by Charlie Parsons. This series premiered on May perhaps 31, 2000 on CBS. It can be hosted by veteran television system personality, reporter and one-time performance show emcee Jeff Probst, who might be also an executive designer, and also executive that is caused by Mark Burnett and main creator Charlie Parsons. WATCH HERE : Watch Survivor: Redemption Island Season 22 Episode 11 The show maroons a small grouping strangers (as one or longer tribes) in a destitute locale, where they ought to provide food, water, open fire, and shelter for themselves, while competing in challenges to earn either a reward, or an immunity from expulsion from the game yearly of the successive votes for elimination. While a great deal rarer than elimination by vote, medical conditions, such as injury or infection, need eliminated several contestants. The last 2 or three survivors face a jury historically made from at least the final seven players voted shut off.

Co., ‘Oh Well’ – Song Review\nJust days after the announcement of a new Fleetwood Mac tribute album, fans can hear the first offering. ZZ Top‘s Billy Gibbons fronts a group that slows down and swampifies the 1969 hit ‘Oh Well.’\nNo one will accuse Gibbons, Matt Sweeney and Blake Mills of being intimidated by the already bluesy rock song. Their version is an original, born from the mud of Mississippi Delta.\nThis new power trio stretch a two or three minute cut (original version) to nearly five minutes of rootsy rambling with bare bones percussion and organ garnish. Gibbons is a burly behemoth on vocals, which don’t begin until almost 90 seconds into the song.\n‘s ‘Oh Well’ was one from his Texas twosome’s catalog. Sweeney has another cut on ‘Just Tell Me That You Want Me,’ available Aug. 14. This song makes you want to hear it immediately.\nListen to Billy Gibbons &amp; Co., 'Oh Well'\n&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://1069therock.com/billy-gibbons-co-oh-well-song-review/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:32:50&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/ultimateclassicrock.com/files/2012/06/Fleetwood-Mac.jpg&quot;,&quot;Just Tell Me That You Want Me Just Tell Me That You Want Me&quot;],[&quot;http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/ultimateclassicrock.com/files/2012/06/8_out_102.png&quot;,&quot;8_out_10&quot;],[&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/syndication-assets/ucr_syn_logo.png&quot;,&quot;UltimateClassicRock.com UltimateClassicRock.com&quot;]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/ultimateclassicrock.com/files/2012/06/Fleetwood-Mac.jpg\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Just Tell Me That You Want Me Just Tell Me That You Want Me\&quot;\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/ultimateclassicrock.com/files/2012/06/8_out_102.png\&quot;,\n    \&quot;8_out_10\&quot;\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/syndication-assets/ucr_syn_logo.png\&quot;,\n    \&quot;UltimateClassicRock.com UltimateClassicRock.com\&quot;\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ Review\nAs far as sub-literate, incomprehensible pieces of garbage are concerned, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D‘ is one of the year’s best.\nWith an asinine plot, risible dialogue and atrocious acting, this sequel to a half-remembered video game adaptation still manages to provide a great number of base thrills with its nightmarish imagery. As such it is a quagmire of dread both within and without, disturbing to watch and to think about. This makes for a strange alchemy: in time you identify with the lead character (a young woman in peril) not because you are engaged with the film, but because enduring such an atrocity becomes its own act of survival. How ’bout that for a neat trick, eh?\nWhich isn’t to say ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ isn’t gorgeous to look at. I have almost no recollection of the first film, other than a handful of striking images. That’s back again: the snow, walls of skin, faceless undead, buildings disintegrating into ash, contorted mannequins and an enormous bruiser with a metal pyramid over its head. Whether popping out of shadows for jump-scares or merely lined up in a tableaux, they are creepy and mysterious and get under your skin more so, frankly, than any other disturbing images in a mainstream horror film released this year.\nEven the “normal” scenes, the blue collar town and its mundane interiors, are saturated with bright, bold colors. There’s such a fine attention to the look (and sound, if your theater has nice speakers) it is shocking that the filmmakers would allow such truly wretched dialogue.\nIt’s just a few scenes in, when Sean Bean is having some sort of flashback with the previous film’s Radha Mitchell, where the belly laughs come. The words trip from their mouths like when little kids pretend at acting in a classical play. But in time you’ll put together that our lead, young Adelaide Clemens (playing 17 but, no offense, she could pass for 32) [Ed. note: she's 22] must not ever, ever, ever go to the mysterious town of Silent Hill. This is made abundantly clear. Yet when strange creatures begin following her, such as twitching, skinned, faceless creatures and, worse, Martin Donovan in a ruffled raincoat, loose tie and dirty hat, it’s only a matter of time before she hits the road.\nOstensibly she’s searching for her father (Bean) who is tied up in some ‘Flash Gordon’-ish chamber, but she’ll quickly discover that her visit will lead to an epic battle between good and evil, summoning a dormant spirit and…I dunno…there’s something to do with a giant coin that, when shoved into Malcolm McDowell’s chest does something to unleash….something. Even with Jon Snow from ‘Game of Thrones‘ hammering us with exposition in a really strange Canadian accent (though the film is set within a night’s drive of West Virginia,) I’m fairly certain that there is no one person out there that can explain the entirety of the baffling plot to ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D.’ I’m sure the video game purists will delight in all the boxes that need to be ticked before elevating to the next level; the rest of us will just wonder where the hell they’re running now.\nThe thing is that with better acting and a reevaluation of the script, you could almost take this movie seriously. Many of the scenes have a ‘Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me’ vibe, but whereas David Lynch will intentionally derail the narrative to evoke an uncomfortable response, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ does it all au naturale. The overall disconnect (one minute an atmospheric ‘Carnival of Souls,’ the next minute unreleasable trash) is something that, I must confess, I enjoyed, but that is because I admire the occasional baffling moviegoing experience. Your mileage up this hill, as they say, may vary.\n‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ is now playing in theaters.\nJordan Hoffman is a writer, critic and lapsed filmmaker living in New York City.

She can be counted on to sell about four million copies of her albums, in an age when albums don’t sell four million copies. She makes a cool milli per show, and with a CoverGirl contract, she’s golden like her curls.\nBiebs, a Forbes cover boy, tallied $55 million receipts. He’s a venture capitalist in the digital realm. RiRi — a former CoverGirl herself — raked in $53 million. Album sales, tours and promo gigs, with the deep pocket likes Vita Coco and Nivea skincare, earned her this slot.\nGaga fell from grace a bit. She plummeted to No. 4, after topping the list in 2011. She dropped from $90 million to $52 million. We know, $42 million seems like a big drop, but when the average Jane makes under $100,000, it’s hard to sympathize. The reason for the drop? Less touring in 2012, so expect an increase next year, since receipts from her Born This Way Ball, which is selling out, will count towards that list.\nPerry tallied $45 million from her music and touring. She won’t have to split it with ex-hubby Russell Brand, with whom she did not (!!!) have a pre-nup. That Russell is a stand up guy, and we’re not talking about his comedian gig.\nTop 10 Under 30:\n1.

(The Heck Of A Guy video of the 1980 version of Do I Have To Dance All Night has logged 9,663 views.)\nCue the festivities: Woo Hoo\nAfter all, 30,000 views on YouTube, a site where videos displaying cats performing cuteness beneath misspelled captions ring up millions of views isn’t much to email home about.\nIn fact, while an unbiased self-assessment may be intrinsically impossible, my best efforts in that spirit would hold that the personal significance of reaching this YouTube milestone breaks down to\n- Self-adulatory braggadocio – 20%\n- Rationalization for publishing yet another post about Do I Have To Dance All Night – 80%\nIndeed, spreading the awareness of Do I Have To Dance All Night, Leonard Cohen’s dandy, underappreciated song has become a moral imperative for this site.\nThe title of the first Heck Of A Guy post featuring this song (on July 6th, 2006) is revelatory: Do I Have To Dance All Night – The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, I could then legitimately report\n… even someone who was a Big Leonard Cohen Fan probably hadn’t heard Do I Have To Dance All Night,2AKA The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, unless he or she were\n1. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who went to the right concerts in the late ’70s\nor\n2. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who bought his or her 45s in Central Europe\nor\n3..2 Indeed, Do I Have To Dance All Night was and continues to be available only as a seven inch single that was originally recorded at a 1976 concert in Paris and pressed in Holland for sale in Central European countries.3\nAnd, I have repeatedly pointed out that this is a great, altogether wonderful Leonard Cohen.\nHeck Of A Guy hosts items about the semi-funky 1976 version of the song with Laura Branigan and the 1980 more gypsy, less disco rendition, videos constructed for both of these versions (1976 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video and 1980 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video), a groom singing Do I Have To Dance All Night at his wedding reception, a Christmas download of a MP3 of the song, and 30+ more.\nSo, 30,000 views of a song by a singer routinely said to have a cult following, a song that singer most recently performed over 30 years ago, a song that was only briefly released in 1976 as a 7 inch single in central Europe, a song that existed on the 2006 iteration of the internet in obscure bootlegs and as a single, hideously flawed MP3 in file-sharing systems … ain’t bad.\nThe crusade continues.\nLeonard Cohen – Do I Have To Dance All Night (1976 version)\n- Do I Have To Dance All Night is also the 1st Heck Of A Guy video; there are currently more than 4o such videos dealing with Leonard Cohen. [↩]\n- According to the Wikipedia, “Cohen wanted to include “Misty Blue”/”Do I Have to Dance All Night” as a free bonus single with the [Recent Songs] LP, but Columbia, his record company, rejected the idea.” [↩]\n- Do I Have To Dance All Night is Side A on the single; Side B features “The Butcher,” which is available on the Songs From a Room album. [↩]\nI agree, it is an addictive song. Very sexy.

Was a bit skeptical about the food, but when I finally tried it out, I’m pleased to report that they do a pretty good steak! Service was also pretty decent, even though I’ve read several reviews that mention otherwise.\nThe steak that I ordered was the Hanging Tender $26 and it lived up to its name. Every bite was really flavourful yet tender. The only thing I didn’t like was the herb butter which I chose. I think if given the choice again, I would go for the Cabernet Sauvignon Mushroom sauce. Come to think of it, it should have been common sense to order that sauce, but I was kind of hoping that the butter would be special too. But given that the steak is so heavy already, you don’t really want more fats via the butter. On the whole, still one of the best steaks I’ve had for this price range.\nThe Partner had the Ribeye. He was looking for grassfed Ribeye, but the only grassfed option was for the Sirloin which he doesn’t like. still, it was a tasty Ribeye and I enjoyed stealing bits of it too. The steak fries were also very good, crispy just the way I like it.\nDefinitely going to come back again to Meatworks. But a huge grouse is that they don’t serve alcohol! Something along the lines of them wanting to be Halal, so the waitress said. To intensify the pain, they haven’t actually removed the alcohol page from the menu!You have to go to the supermarket on the same floor to get the wine if you need some, and corkage is charged at $20 per bottle. Steak really tastes loads better when you have a glass of wine in hand. And for some reason, I really was hankering for a glass after all that energy spent on shopping earlier. We plodded through without the wine, but certainly for the next round, I will buy a bottle or sneak one in!\nMeatWorks ION Orchard\n2 Orchard Turn #04-12\nSingapore 238801\nT +65 6634 0026\nF +65 6634 8901\nE talktous@meatworks.com.sg&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://365days2play.com/category/3-2-shopping-centres/orchard-ion-mall/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:12:38&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Postcards from a Global Trekker: Cape Town, South Africa\nI had a belated birthday celebration this year, given that my 40th birthday fell on Thanksgiving Day, 2010. While my family did a wonderful job incorporating a mini-celebration for me amongst the usual Turkey Day festivities, I never really did acknowledge the day with very much fanfare. Then six months into my 40th year I found myself presented with the rare opportunity of mixing business with pleasure and a second chance at marking a milestone year with a monumental event. At the coaxing of a colleague and friend, I said yes to taking a trip to a place that (20 years in the making) has been on my dream list of places to see in the world. This October I traveled to Cape Town, South Africa for the 2011 World Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health and below are just a few snapshots of the wonderful experience I had both professionally and personally.\nEleven days in total, half for the congress and half for exploring, the trip was both nothing and everything I could have imagined and more. The conference renewed in me my passion for medicine and reminded me of the importance and complications involved in addressing mental health issues on the larger world public health scale.\nAnd my time spent exploring the city of Cape Town and meeting its people was absolutely thrilling. Cape Town is blessed with the most stunning natural geologic beauty but its greatest treasures, in my humble opinion, are found amongst its people, especially its artists. I hope you enjoy below a small glimpse of my attempts at capturing the many beautiful experiences I was lucky enough have during my unforgettable adventure in South Africa.\nReader Comments&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://3sistersvillage.com/blog/2011/11/9/postcards-from-a-global-trekker-cape-town-south-africa.html&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:41:26&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;/universal/images/transparent.png&quot;,&quot;Date Date&quot;],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_4_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320345570650&quot;,null],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_6_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341975155&quot;,null],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_1_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341756261&quot;,null],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_2_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320340855787&quot;,null],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_5_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342382339&quot;,null],[&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_3_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342533160&quot;,null]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;/universal/images/transparent.png\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Date Date\&quot;\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_4_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320345570650\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_6_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341975155\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_1_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341756261\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_2_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320340855787\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_5_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342382339\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_3_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342533160\&quot;,\n    null\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Rhonda D. McLaughlin vs Bank of America – Sandusky Woman Sues Bank of America Over “Robo-” Foreclosure\nSince we are on the subject of BOA today, here is another little gem…\nSandusky woman sues bank over “robo-” foreclosure\nA Sandusky woman filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming the foreclosure of her North Larchmont Drive home was spurred on by “robo-signing,” where bank employees signed affidavits without bothering to review documents.\nRhonda D. McLaughlin filed her lawsuit against Bank of America, N.A., and Rhonda Weston, a vice president of Bank of America. Fannie Mae and Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray also are named as defendants in the suit.\nSandusky attorney Dan McGookey, a foreclosure specialist, is McLaughlin’s attorney.\nIt may be the first lawsuit filed in the U.S. by a private citizen seeking to undo an already completed foreclosure on grounds that a robo-signer was used, McGookey said.\nMcLaughlin lived at 1608 North Larchmont Drive in Sandusky when Bank of America foreclosed on the home in 2007.\nMcLaughlin, still a Sandusky resident, lost the home when Erie County Common Pleas Court Judge Roger Binette granted a motion for summary judgment in 2008.\nThe summary judgment was based on an affidavit from Weston, who said McLaughlin was in default on her mortgage.\nBinette has been assigned McLaughlin’s new lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit alleges Weston was a “robo-signer” who didn’t actually review documents she referred to in her affidavit.\nThe suit cites news stories that say robo-signers signed thousands of affidavits each month without reviewing the mortgage documents, while banks tried to rush through as many foreclosures as possible.\nThe lawsuit refers to an Associated Press citing court depositions from a Florida attorney, who said employees at Bank of America and other banks commonly approved phony paperwork.\n“Until now, only a handful of depositions from robo-signers have come to light,” said the Oct. 12 news story. “But the sheer volume of the new depositions will make it more difficult for financial institutions to argue that robo-signing was an aberrant practice in a handful of rogue back offices.”\nMcLaughlin’s lawsuit asks for Fannie Mae, now the owner of the North Larchmont Drive home, to give the home back to McLaughlin. It seeks $50,000 in damages and other costs and fees.\nYou can check out the rest of the report here…\nAnd you can check out the complaint below…\n~\n4closureFraud.org\n~\nRhonda D. McLaughlin vs Bank of America\nI have an “Assignment” of the Security Deed only by MERS to BOA signed and dated May of 2008 and a letter from BOA in May of 2009 which states BOA was “seeking ownership but did not yet possess” an interest in the property and instructions to “get out of the house….”\nMERS recorded this “Assignment” of the Security Deed ONLY in Sept 2010 and BOA then performed a non judicial sale of the property in October 2010 based on MERS assignment—–not an assignment by the original lender American Home Mortgage.\nThe President of BOA cannot produce the original note or an assignment of the note by the original lender and foreclosed and took possession of the property without EVER recording anything on the land records here\nCan you say: “Fraud?” The documents themselves do not “sync” and in GA MERS cannot be a trustee, mortgagee, or act independently of written instructions and said docs recorded…..\nI am pretty close to filing against BOA and MERS—-American Home Mortgage is defunct—so I don’t know who really owns my property, p note or security deed….\nThe courts have to rule on these things.\nPissed Off European ‘Lynch Mob’ Is Coming After Bank Of America\nyou just made me laugh… I have to read that\nWESTON could not have been a VP in 2007.\nI have a document that list ALL BAC “ROBO” SIGNORS on a interoffice memo ( or what looks to be ) whereby\nRHONDA WESTON WAS NOT certified VP by the CORPORATION until 8/7/2009.\nThis document could be a get-out-of-jail free card for some people who falsified AFFIDAVITS!\nMy comments are redacted, this case has that document for BofA ROBO’S. Observation…….how could WESTON have claimed VP before the designation was affirmed by corporate in 2008 over a year before? Why did attorney not provide a “CHAIN OF TITLE ” ?\nI think this one is in the Barn for Plaintiff! Good Luck!\ndo you or anyone else have a copy of the paper that she was not certified as a vp. i would love a copy! thanks!!\nGood posts!!!\nThis is Foreclosure Terrorism. It seems obvious that the judges are lining their pockets and looking the other way. How do you define treason? Well one way would be to say that anyone, any company, any court, any entity that willfully supports Fraud on a scale as massive as this which actually puts children in the streets is directly involved with these crimes against American Home Owners. I call that treason. Where is the FBI in all of this? They just now started making arrests in a handful of cases. But this has been going on for years. What happened to law in this country? It was bought and paid for by the Wall Street Banksters. Spineless politicians are also lining their pockets to look the other way. It is no coincidence that they can’t seem to find a law to stop any of this. It is not possible that they are that incompetent. There are obviously billions in bribes going to the useless bastards who get a nice house on the hill while putting children in the streets. Stop voting Republican or Democrat. They have demonstrated that they are equally involved. It’s time to clean house. We need Joe American in the White House. A child could run a better country and still have time to play in the sandbox after lunch. J Glenn Lowe – Die Banker Die –\nAgreed Glenn!!\nThis is most certainly treason, and should come under the heading of “Crimes Against Humanity”. Neither republican nor democrat is innocent in this mess.\nThis is very interesting. I’m guessing that she won’t be the last person to try this. And why shouldn’t she? If a bank did not have the proper paper work? If they forged documents? If these “Vice-Presidents” that are attesting to the authenticity of these documents are just poor, temp-employees that are signing because it’s either that or go broke and starve? If all of this “stuff” (that’s the polite word) the banks are using as proof, is all fales, then why should we or the banks just assume that they have the legal right to take anyone’s private property. I get so ANGRY! when I hear paid shills for the banks get on the radio or TV saying that we should just assume that the banks have a right even if they have been caught forging documents and lying to courts of law.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://4closurefraud.org/2010/10/25/sandusky-woman-sues-bank-of-america-over-robo-foreclosure/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:21:14&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;>>IMAGE.\nThe interaction designer plans for these moments. Part of their responsibility is to make all interactions positive, and includes aspects of the software, the copy-writing, the graphics, layout, flows, physical experiences. It’s a shame when one part of the experience is top notch and another is dreadful. Cohesion is important.\nUser experience spans multiple practices. Let’s take an example from architecture. If an architect were hired by a deep-pocketed client to create a great user experience, they wouldn’t stop at the structure in which people live. They would pay attention to the surrounding greenery, the arc of the driveway, the views of the property at each angle…maybe even the way guests are greeted and the table is set. All of these touch-points are important parts of the larger system…the house is merely one piece of the puzzle.\nWeb designers, traditionally secure in the role of page creators, now have a wider purview. The landscape on which people experience our design is wider than ever before. Thus, we must adapt our ways to include all aspects of experience.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://52weeksofux.com/post/322319598/what-makes-the-user-experience&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:40:58&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kvwcyz6wgk1qz7ace.jpg&quot;,&quot;Sketch of a plantation&quot;]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kvwcyz6wgk1qz7ace.jpg\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Sketch of a plantation\&quot;\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;It just seemed so celebratory at first. After rain and a backlog of matches, the Sony Ericsson decided to pluck Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic from the main stage and instead put them on Court 2. Delighted fans cheered at their luck, convinced they were waiting for the conclusion of a doubles match involving Nuria Llagostera Vives. The players were jovial, too, laughing as they walked onto the tiny court; they almost looked like dolls too big for their playhouse.\nIn the first set it seemed everyone was getting used to the surroundings, including the crowd. Clijsters fell hard early on and everyone screamed and then chuckled in embarrassment for the outburst. They gasped when Ivanovic hit a laser forehand and seemed concerned when Clijsters hit some of her signature splits. It was tennis’ version of keeping it real.\nThe level was very high in the first set. Although not the most entertaining points, many rallies ended quickly with a winner and both women held serve throughout fairly easily. Clijsters knows how to win much better than Ivanovic these days and she closed out the set in a tiebreak.\nIn the second with Ivanovic up 2-0, I thought about the difference between 3-0 and 2-1. Clijsters was broken in the first serving at 2-0 and it changed the set; Ivanovic held for 3-0 and pretty much rolled through the second. Funny thing about Clijsters: when she drops her level, she becomes an amateur. She lost her timing, seemed confused on the court, sprayed balls well out or mishit them so badly they landed at the service line on her side of the court. Ivanovic took the set 6-3.\nThe third set was all about focus. Ivanovic had it; Clijsters didn’t. The result? A quick 5-1 lead for Ivanovic and 0-40 on Clijsters’ serve. Done, right? Wrong. Typically at this point you see kids with large balls making their way to the front of the court. It’s not really possible on Court 2 but we did get a rush of photographers who swooped in to catch match point. And the newest vulture out there, Cari Champion from Tennis Channel suddenly emerged, ready to do her on-court interview.\nBut focus changed quickly. We’ve seen this before from both women and usually Kim wins them and Ana doesn’t. All I can say is: it went fast. Truthfully, although there was some nice play at times from both players, it wasn’t really a thrilling match until it became about nerves. Ivanovic couldn’t hit through five match points; Kim only needed one at 6-5 in the tiebreak to win it. Poor Ana.\nI thought parties were supposed to be fun?&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://72unforcederrorswp.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/clijsters-vs-ivanovic-want-to-know-what-happened/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T11:01:38&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Get a trade-in offer for your vehicle.\nREADY TO SCOOT!What's the dividing line between a scooter and a motorcycle?

In the spotlight this weekend: Faron Young, country singer and songwriter from the early 1950′s into the mid 1980′s.\nOne of Faron’s biggest hits was “Hello Walls.” Written by Willie Nelson, it held the position of #1 for 9 weeks on the Country Charts 50 years ago in 1961. Hits like “You Ain’t lovin’ You Ain’t Living,” and “Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young,” made him a honky tonk singer.\nFaron Young was one of country music’s most colorful stars. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana in February 1932. He was discovered by Webb Pierce in 1951.

Thus, we learned today of Glenn Beck's plan for Independence, America. Announced on his show and reported on by Mike Krumboltz of Yahoo News, \&quot;Beck-town USA\&quot; will be a self-sustaining community of real Americans, and I can only assume it will be located somewhere between Brigadoon and Shangri-La. This paradise will allow all the John Galts of America to escape the progressive hell they currently occupy, and it will also free them from the horrors of consumer culture. Apparently, Glenn Beck has some contempt for successful American corporations like The Gap and Ann Taylor, as he plans to ban them from his Eden, saying \&quot;if you want the Gap or Ann Taylor, go someplace else.\&quot;\nBeck-ville is supposed to be self-sustaining - like the hippie communes of the 1960s - for it will also feature a ranch where people will \&quot;grow food\&quot; and \&quot;teach others\&quot; how to grow food. Hmmm. Sounds like Glenn Beck is going a little Mao Ze Dong on the country. Perhaps all Beck-ville-ites will smelt their own iron and sew their own cotton into their own clothes as well. These happy little \&quot;nationalists (?)\&quot; will be entertained, of course, by shows featuring Glenn Beck running the Beck media center. I'd imagine that HBO and ESPN and Hollywood films will be unavailable because they are all products of the commie elite in this country. Sounds like a great little paradise that Beck has plans for. Where it will be, I'm not sure. However, I'd bet the states of Mississippi or Alabama would love to be freed from the chains of all the federal aid they currently receive. Or perhaps Beck could just convince the state of Texas to secede with him.\nThis isn't the first time that Glenn Beck has revealed a colossal misunderstanding of history and economics. Last time, he stole from Founding Father Thomas Paine and bastardized the classic tome Common Sense. Of course, I don't think Glenn Beck really has a plan for his utopia. However, he is all but too happy to sell a bunch of Republican conservatism to under-educated or ideologically naive people for a nice little profit.\n1 comment:\nIf you're interested in joining a real libertarian community with a proven track record, check out the Free State Project.\nfreestateproject.org/fsn42&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://a-teachers-view.blogspot.com/2013/01/glenn-beck-plans-hippy-dippy-utopia.html&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:53:10&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Discover Your Blip.

She had so much fun making faces.\nAfter A went to bed, Cayden got some mommy snuggles. I love this baby boy.\nLast Monday night Adalyn was sitting on the counter making dinner with me as she does most nights. I took the skillet off of the flat top burner and turned my head for one second and she put her hand on the burner. It was horrible. I've never seen her in such pain. Her cry was horrible and I felt horrible. I called the Dr after hours and she didn't feel that we needed to go to the ER. We finally got A calmed down and she ate a little dinner. We had mini cupcakes in the house so we gave her one after dinner to help her feel better. I think it helped. What do you think?\nShe decided eating her cupcake with no hands was better than eating it with one hand. (She did the same thing for her birthday cupcake.) Funny girl.\nShe has big blisters the length of each finger still. Poor thing. She's so not a complainer tho. We went to the Dr the next day and she gave us a rx for burn cream and A lets us put it on her and has been good about keeping a sock over her hand to protect it.\nSweet babies. I love these two and how much they love each other.\nOn Sunday Adalyn went and found her sunglasses in the junk drawer and put them on her head to wear them around. I guess she's seen mommy do that. Jonathan and I couldn't believe how old she looked. Even her little pose in this picture... She's growing up!\nI always give Adalyn a \&quot;pony\&quot; on the top of her head. But I had never tried to give her a real pony tail with all of her hair. I put this in on Sunday and she loved it and showed me her pony and then would point to mine. This didn't help with how old she was looking that day!!\nWe've had a bit of TV drama. VERY long story short, our old TV was an extremely good TV that we got an amazing deal on 3 years ago. For a few months it's been acting weird to the point that we have to unplug and replug it to get it to work. We had purchased the extended protection plan at Best Buy (usually a waste of money but we got our monies worth out of it!) and had it serviced 4 times without any good results so Best Buy put us in for a replacement. We took both kids to run into the store to pick out our new TV. It turned into multiple hours in the store. They delivered the TV the next weekend and from the moment it was on the wall we both absolutely hated it. I know it's petty because it was a 52 inch flat screen TV. We shouldn't complain about teeny tiny things like how crisp the picture, color and sound were, but we felt like we had given up our amazing old tv that we still loved for a piece of crap. We went back and did an exchange and waited till the next weekend for our new TV to be delivered yet again. We went back to our original brand (Samsung) and from the moment we plugged it in we loved it. We were back to the original quality of our old TV. (Guess that wasn't really a \&quot;long story short\&quot;...more like a \&quot;long story\&quot;.) Adalyn was quite enthralled with the different TV's going on and off the wall and the Best Buy guys delivering the new TVs. She even tried to help her daddy hang the new TV so I had to get pictures.\nShe was serious about it.\nMy sweet smiley boy. He is an absolute joy. I love him so much! He has found his voice and his tongue. He's constantly talking and squawking and blowing raspberries now. I think he's trying to compete with his sister because he is LOUD! :)\n6 comments:\nThat pony tail is too cute and she does look grown up! I want our babies back! Hope A's hand heals soon! Yay for a new TV!\nPictures are the best and that's really all that matters. I remember not having much time at all, but I do have a ton of pictures to look back on! :) I hope her burn is better.. that is so scary! K got burned on her bottom really, really bad when she was little all from going down a hot slide in her bathing suit. So just an FYI, always check slides in the summertime. I know after that everyone I know does, including K.\nAck! I can't believe my baby girl is getting so old!\nThe picture of her with her pony tail reminds me so much of Kennedy. Where did our baby girl go?\nOk. I totally get the tv scenario.. my hubs feels the same way about picture quality, etc. So much so that it takes us months to decide on one!\nWhat is that double Sophie thing C is holding? Very interesting! He is flipping adorable and growing too fast.\nA is precious in her glasses and pony! Poor baby with that hand!\nYay...I always love seeing your blog pop up on the reader! :)\nThanks for the update. Glad all is going well. Poor A with her hand! I can't imagine the pain {both of you!} where in! :(\nI'm in lov with Adalyn's pony...precious! Her poor little hand - I imagine that was quite traumatic. Hope she is feeling much better! I love, love all the little faces - those will be so much fun to look at years from now. C is getting so big. I can't believe our babies are going to be 1/2 year old soon - how did that happen?&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://abbysugarandspice.blogspot.com/2013/01/playing-catch-up.html&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:31:11&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;After the historic Navy SEAL raid that took out Osama bin Laden in early May, officials from the U.S. government shared an extraordinary amount of information about the top secret operation, including the revelation that the whole thing had actually been captured on video by cameras mounted on the SEALs' helmets.\nSeveral top U.S. officials said the video -- which reportedly contains the moment the al Qaeda leader was killed -- would not be made public, but a new report is calling into question whether the footage exists at all.\nThe report, slated for publication this week by The New Yorker, says that no helmet-cams were involved in the operation. The New Yorker's report offers a detailed account of the raid, but admits that parts may be \&quot;imprecise\&quot; since it can only be recreated based on recollection.\nCBS News first reported the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras, and top U.S. officials confirmed to several news organizations, including ABC News, at the time that some of the SEALs had worn them. That information was based on initial reports received by officials in Washington, D.C.\nThe New Yorker article does not cite any specific sources for its information on the helmet-cams, but bases other account details on U.S. officials involved in the operation.\nSpokesmen for the Department of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment for this report about the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras.\n\&quot;We have not released any information on that operation, nor will we,\&quot; U.S. SOCOM public affairs officer Ken McGraw told ABC News.\nWhen a tense President Obama and national security team watched the operation unraveling from the White House's Situation Room -- a moment now immortalized in an iconic photograph -- it was reported they were not watching live feeds from any helmet-cams, but instead a feed from a drone buzzing thousands of feet above the SEALs' heads.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-laden-raid-navy-seal-helmet-cams/story?id=14205401&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:21:50&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list

Man Auditing Classes ---- did I tell you the funny stories about him? remind me to tell you about his rant about aliens. No, I'm not kidding. But he was a sweetheart and as long as you could keep him on track he made a lot of good contributions to the class ---- well, he was taking a pottery class along with mine and he made me a mug!\nSee? It is currently decorating my office, but I don't trust his glazing skills enough to actually use it. That's ok; it's pretty. And it makes me want to take cool pottery classes every time I look at it.\nThis semester I have a different little sweetheart, who is out and proud and not only willing to step up and testify on that front but also bring up issues of race and social justice in the class, which is awesome. And he catches whatever little risque jokes or off-color puns I accidentally make but I don't feel like I'm about to get into trouble.\nA while back he asked me some questions after class --- those questions that don't really seem to have a point except for the subtext of \&quot;I like you!\&quot; --- And I have been there with that awkward I-don't-know-what-to-say-to-a-favorite-teacher-but-I-don't-want-the-class-to-be-over situation and totally love that.\nSo the next day he dropped by my office hours with a big plastic shopping bag. \&quot;Dr. Cog, I just wanted to give this to you!\&quot; Awwwwww. So I opened it up, and found ...\nHmm. On the one hand, I totally appreciate this. And I drank them, so it's not like I am worried he was poisoning me or anything. Every day I'd open one and go \&quot;sweet! I don't have to spend any money on my caffeine habit!\&quot; But I also, because I have to overthink everything, wonder if this is making some sort of comment on me, or on my caffeine habit or weight or something.\nBut no! Stop this! Just drink your damn gifts and revel in the fact that you were offered them. If they start offering me whiskey to mix with it, that's when I know I have a problem.\n4 comments:\nOne former student gave me a big jug of homemade maple syrup. :) (Her family makes maple syrup, along with growing farm stuff.) WAY COOL! And soooo yummy!\nI'm still waiting for the Porsche and the diamonds. /nod\nThis is all so so sweet.\nWell, except for the anaphylactic death part.\nOh, just enjoy the goodies. My first - and certainly most memorable - was a bag of comfort food: mac &amp; cheese, diet coke, cookies, candy bars - from a student in one of my very first classes. She brought it by when she found out I was prepping for my MA exams, along with best wishes from all the friends she'd met in that class.\nI've had the occasional student give me perfume or scented lotions, which have a less-dramatic version of the effect of coconut on you (headache, not anaphylactic shock), but nothing more interesting than that. I sort of like the idea that he actually observed your habits and came up with something that fit them (well, at least until he shows up on your doorstep at midnight one night, but that doesn't seem likely).&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2012/03/looking-gift-horse-in-mouth.html&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:21:52&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S5IsrZAgA8k/T16r409HUuI/AAAAAAAABuo/m7uyu23bvuY/s320/IMG_1040.jpg&quot;,null]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S5IsrZAgA8k/T16r409HUuI/AAAAAAAABuo/m7uyu23bvuY/s320/IMG_1040.jpg\&quot;,\n    null\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Find answers to yourtechnical questions\nAsk questions to the HubSpot community\nCheck out the upcoming training webinars and register to attend live.

With a special (and hilarious) guest appearance by White Collar’s Willie Garson, their latest short, awesomely entitled FOPS, represents the best three and a half minutes this gang of hooligans has come up with yet – just in time for Bastille Day this weekend. Keep reading if you like delicious cakes …\nFOPS is obviously a sendup of COPS. Only this time the chase involves a couple of gungho peasants (Matt Hobby and Philip Quinaz) hunting down decadent cake and candy inhaling richies armed with nothing but some of that homemade piss and vinegar spray everybody was carrying around back in the days of the French Revolution. There’s even a snitching hillbilly fop (Brian Shoaf) who gladly gives up the head cake-eater (Garson) hiding out in the woodlands .\nWATCH FOPS below and take a gander at Garson’s scene-stealing turn as the strung out King getting caught with icing on his lip.\nThe PERIODS. crew has been doing it and doing it well for a while now, starting with the almost instantly viral PILGRIMS. The series is co-created by Quinaz’s wife Anna Martemucci and usually stars his brother Philip Quinaz, both from whom a large portion of the hilarity originates. Featured in the The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Film Independent, and on Funny or Die, they have quickly become known for taking on serious subjects such as the rich and their problem with cake abuse, Ponce de Leon, pillaging and raping, religion and lesbians, and the classic film Deer Hunter (we feel that NAM is the golden sleeper egg of the entire series). Shot in the style of a reality show with a historical twist, this is done with the kind of deceptively intelligent, slow burning improvised humor that will still resonate a week later when you remember the image of Philip Quinaz stroking his own nipples in the midst of foliage.\nIf you don’t believe us check out Adam’s (of Adam and Eve) apple ball-gag in RE: CREATION. (The wigs in that are amazing, by the way.) While you’re doing that see what his homey God has to say about … whatever.\nAlways these shorts are released with some timely relevance. Like with FOPS and Bastille Day. While we’re pretty sure only the French care about this upcoming day (or even know what it is, really) we still have to give the PERIODS. crew props for their ingenious ploy for attention.\nActor Zachary Quinto might have something to do with all the buzz as well. His name is attached to the series as occasional co-star and regular producer with his company Before The Door Pictures in association with Robinson Film, Inc., and Nomadic Films.\nThere are big things on the horizons for these guys, including a feature film produced by Anonymous Content and Before The Door Pictures that is due out sometime this fall. Quinto will also be in attendance to introduce the PERIODS. short series with Quinaz and Martemucci at the Hollyshorts Film Festival on August 9th.\nIn the meantime, ‘God’ commands you to go watch all the shorts and subscribe to the PERIODS. Films channel on Youtube for more tomfoolery involving fabulous wigs and costumes with just a skotch of controversy thrown in. All the jokes about a woman’s time of the month aside, we dig the pantaloons out of it.

Maybe, Heirloom Tomato Modern? Of the now five entries in this occasional editorial feature, three are for tomato soup. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps in the past tomato soups were more flexible, more interesting, more varied. Or, maybe I just really like tomato soup!\nheirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque\nWhat was the occasion that called for yet another tomato soup? I had just pulled “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen” from the oven, and while it was cooling I realised I needed a simple foil for this “best thing.”\nI didn’t feel like running to the market, my brain felt wibbly from hunger and exertion, I wanted something quick and easy. I poked my head in the fridge. Aha! A carton of Pomis! I poked my nose in The Best Of Shaker Cooking. Aha! A simple tomato bisque! (The Shakers are so reliable for simple, quick recipes). Et voila! Dinner was decided.\nThere are three recipes for tomato soup in this amazing book, but this one from Frances Hall intrigued me with its inclusion of baking soda.\nAlthough she is not noted as being a member of the faithful at Hancock Village, this reference leads me to believe that Frances Hall was actually the last eldress of this beautiful village that is now a working museum (and definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area, A. because it didn’t bore me as a 7th grader on a field trip and B. There’s an amazing restaurant there).\nAnd what of the baking soda? As near as I can figure it added a delicate lightness to this soup which would be very, very necessary if you followed the original recipe which calls for 1 quart of milk (most likely whole and with cream back then) and 1/2 cup of heavy cream! I did not follow those measurements and, after tasting the soup sans dairy and realising it tasted just like Campbell’s, embarked on some very necessary modernising.\nI cut down on the dairy, added some garlic and tossed in some slightly spicy, seductively smoky Spanish pimenton de la vera. The pepper added such a lovely, almost bacon-y flavor. Utterly delicious!\nAnd what is “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen?” You’ll just have to stay tuned til tomorrow (or snoop around on my flickr page, should be pretty obvious from there).\nHead below the jump for my adaptation of Eldress Hall’s Tomato Bisque.\nheirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque\nprep time: 5 minutes ~ cooking time: 20 minutes\n- 1 tsp Butter\n- 1 tsp Flour\n- 3 cups Tomato Puree\n- heaping 1/4 tsp Baking Soda (the recipe called for 1/3 tsp, but I don’t have one of those, so I just used a heaping 1/4 tsp)\n- 2 tsps Salt\n- 1 tsp Sugar\n- Lemon Juice\n- 2 cloves Garlic, minced\n- 1/2 tsp (or to taste) Pimenton de la Vera\n- 2 cups Milk\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over low to medium heat. Add the flour and cook gently for 2 minutes or until the flour is cooked.\nAdd the tomato puree. Stir to incorporate.\nAdd the salt, sugar and baking soda. Stir to incorporate.\nSimmer 5 minutes.\nTaste. Adjust seasoning. Add a dash of lemon juice if the soup is too sweet.\nAdd the minced garlic and Pimenton. Stir to incorporate. Allow the soup to cook another 10 minutes.\nIn another small pan heat the milk. Do not allow it to boil. When the milk is just warm add it to the tomato mixture, stir to incorporate and serve immediately, piping hot, preferably with some freshly made buttered bread.\nAnd don’t forget to Shaker your plate! (Not that I have any fear you won’t!)\nI´m just about to make some tomato soup. Different version, but I´ll use your tip about the milk. Thanks.\ngreat recipe! I’ve been looking for a simple tomato soup that’s a bit interesting and this appears to be both those things. Many thanks!\nI love the way this soup looks–the beautiful red color has my mouth watering.\nI’ll bet this would be good made with goats’ milk!\nI’m guessing the baking soda is added to balance the pH and keep the milk from curdling. I have a yummy tomato soup recipe of my mom’s that includes it as well.\nAny chance I could see the original recipe as it was?\nRiatta — You can buy the book here for as little as $1 here, or you can check it out from your local library. I am not comfortable publishing other people’s copyrighted material on my site.\nThanks Ann for the link. I’ve ordered the book. Can’t wait to see how you tweaked the recipe. I’m always a little afraid to eperiment.\nOh good Riatta! I hope you love it.

One of the methods we’re using to collect data is a mapping diary. We ask students to record all of their movements through the course of one typical school day–time, location and activity–and draw a map to accompany their time logs. Last year’s responses from students at my own campus were fascinating, and I’m looking forward to interviewing this semester’s students when they finish their logs.\nMany of last year’s participants told me that they really enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on what they do and where they go all day. Now that the semester is firmly underway and things are busy as usual, I wonder whether it might be a good idea to do some research on myself. I’ve often wanted to join the Library Day in the Life project in the past, but it always seems to be scheduled for days that I’m either out on vacation or before the semester has begun (that is, not really a typical day for me). Maybe it’s time for me to pick a day (or week, or month) to record my activities?\nIt’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that there’s not enough time for everything I want to do. Of course that’s true on one level, because no one can do everything, but I also think that we may be less busy than we realize. A post on Prof Hacker over the summer popped into my mind when I was considering this, a review of a book called 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think (168 is the number of hours in a week). The review isn’t completely positive, but does highlight the use of time logging to inject a dose of reality into how we perceive that we spend our time.\nJudging from my interviews with students last year, this kind of reflection can help with both time management and task prioritization. Though it sounds like more work to add a time log to my to-do list here in the thick of the semester, I think it’s worth a try. And maybe the next time the Library Day in the Life date rolls around I’ll be ready to participate, too.\nPosted: October 10, 2010 by Maura Smale\nin Just Thinking.\nTags: diary, reflection, research, time log, time management\nPingback from Weekly Link Roundup «\nPosted: October 14, 2010 at 11:04 pm\n[...] Turning the Research Lens on Ourselves, from ACRLog.

About 100 people attended, who lived in at least 10 countries, including Japan, India, Myanmar, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US. Ages ranged from 18 years old to over 50. Their open tech/culture fields included Python workshops, soft circuits, fan fiction, Linux, open geographical information, open data, open courseware, and Wikipedia and related projects. Attendees were volunteers, professionals, students, hobbyists, and academics, and came from the government, large corporations, non-profits, volunteer communities, small businesses, and educational institutions. We’re very pleased with the diversity of our attendees.\nWe ran over 65 sessions over 2 days. Session topics included Hands on Hacking, Geek Moms, Women Editing Wikipedia, Burnout and Lifehacking, Fandom, Feminism &amp; Social Change, Soft Circuits, Job Seeker/We’re Hiring!, and Feminist Hackathons, to name just a few. In total, over 40 of the sessions were documented on PiratePad.\nThe Impostor Syndrome session was so popular that it ran in at least three separate sessions. One attendee said, .”\nOne of the most popular sessions was the Python Beginners Workshop in which several attendees learned to program for the first time. “It is hard to do workshops at un-conferences, but you can’t put a price on getting someone in front of a terminal and writing a new line of code. It’s empowering to enable the success of another human being,” said Connie Berardi. Leslie Birch said, “I’m leaving with new tools like IRC, bug trackers and mentor lists. I have a new found desire to reach out to other women that identify as ‘geek’, ‘feminist’ or both.”\nOne popular feature of AdaCamp was the “Wall of Compliments.” The idea is to combat Impostor’s Syndrome and increase everyone’s enjoyment of the conference by writing compliments on sticky notes and adding them to a wall. Other attendees “take a compliment” and either keep them or give them to other people to wear on their badges.\nFinally, AdaCamp DC got a lot of compliments on the conference food. Rebecca Garcia tweets, “#AdaCampDC You are spoiling us! First Ethiopian food now Lebanese food? :) Best conference food ever.” Sisi Wei writes, “Ethiopian food for lunch? #adacampdc and @adainitiative are putting other conferences’s cuisines to shame.” Remember, bad conference food is a choice, not a requirement!\nThank you to everyone who helped make AdaCamp DC a success, starting with our conference organizers, Caroline Simard, Deb Nicholson, Kellie Brownell, NoÃrÃn Shirley, Sarah Stierch, Katie Bechtold, and Denise Paolucci. Thanks especially to Sarah Stierch for organizing the conference dinners, writing a dining guide for DC, helping arrange photography, and spreading the word about AdaCamp DC and the various travel scholarships available to AdaCamp DC attendees. Selena Deckelmann also helped arrange photography, organized the sessions, and gave the organizers general assistance.

'Janeway to Auckland Control, roger. Landing approach at one-three-one-mark seven.'\n'Roger, Janeway,' the bright New Zealand voice on the other end of the channel replied. 'Enjoy your stay.'\nShe set about the business of guiding her slim shuttle past the island's rugged mountains without dignifying the Kiwi's sarcasm with a reply. \&quot; [More in New Zealand, pg. 17-29, 35, 61, 66, 228.]\n'Don't tell me you've actually read Nietzsche and Derrida. Or Aquinas, for that matter.'\n'You don't have to eat the entire turd to know that it's not a crab cake.'\n'You are an arrogant impossible boy.' \&quot;\n'The Superman shouldn't care what the ondergeskik thinks of him, you mean? 'I teach you the Superman.' ' He shook his head and fell silent for several moments.\n'Maybe,' he said at last, 'in terms of education, physical training, wealth, eugenics, perhaps soon even genetics--maybe by some standards we Draka have become Nietzsche's superman. We certainly like to flatter ourselves into thinking we have.'\nHe shook his head. 'But one would think that a superman shouldn't have to fear. And we do. We fear everybody else on the planet.'\n'With good reason,' the Archon said. 'Everybody else on the planet fears us. Hates us, too...' \&quot;\nAdmiral Hans Laban Verwoerd lay sprawled in the center of Cornet castle's ancient courtyard. A heavy boot ground itself into his spine, pinning him to the rough stone flagging.\nBanners, printed with motivational slogans, hung limp in the dawn air. Verwoerd turned his head, scraping his cheek against the rough flagstones. I want gremlins around me, the nearest one read, for I am courageous. \&quot; [This quote is from Nietzsche. There are many quotes from and references to Nietzsche throughout story. It is the main religion/philosophy referred to in the story. Not all refs. in DB.]\n' 'What is the best remedy? Victory!' Or 'I want gremlins around me, for I am courageous'?'\n'Yes. What ever does that one mean?'\n'What do Nietzsche's syphilitic rambling ever mean? 'Courage creates gremlins for itself' is the rest of that particular quotation.' He washed out his brush and dabbed a new color. 'Just be glad I'm not hanging those banners all over town the way Security wants me to. They're supposed to remind my troops they're Draka supermen.' He made a face.\n'Are they? They don't act like it.' \&quot;\nHe daubed his brush in a mixture of colors. 'There was a time in my life when I thought of little else but Nietzsche. I was a young man at the time; I'd spent my life in British boarding schools, thought of myself as British, but I was still Draka. I guess I was trying to discover who I was.'\nSally rolled her head around, stretching her neck muscles. She resumed her pose. 'He's almost your state religion, isn't he?'\nVerwoerd snorted. 'The Draka worship nothing but themselves. 'Serfs look up because they wish to be exalted; the superman looks down because he already is exalted.' when you're the oppermans, it's rather had to admit some entity might be superior to yourself. That's why the attempt to revive the Norse mythology, Naldorssen and all that, failed so miserably. Probably also why religion has always fascinated me so.' \&quot;\nVerwoerd smiled weakly. 'Since when did you start reading Nietzsche?' he asked.\n'Since you started hanging it up in the courtyards.' \&quot; [Other refs. not in DB include pg. 208-209, 218-221.]\n...Verwoerd's voice was barely audible. Courage did create its own gremlins: the courage to hope. \&quot;;\nPg. 214: \&quot;'Pity's the greatest danger, Hans. That's what Neechee says, an' it's true. Dangerous for them. Dangerous for us.' \&quot;\n'There's no way you can escape, Hans. The courtyard is swarming with commandos.'\n'Nietzsche was right all along,' Verwoerd said as if he hadn't heard her. 'Right about so many things. 'Once I thought of little else but Nietzsche'--would that I had ever been able to stop!\n'Those three days I stared into the abyss--'thou heaven above me, thou pure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of light!--and it stared back at me.'\n...' 'And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and whatever tainteth thee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, because it tainted thee!' ' \&quot; [More.]\n'Then I visited that accursed city [Salt Lake City], saw that same Will channeled into their [Mormons] morality, their serf dreams. To 'never never never' fall under the yoke, to be gods looking down in pity on mere superman. To will the absurd fantasies of religion into reality--entire nations that don't have to conquer or murder or . . .'\nHe composed himself. 'I knew then my people [Draka] were too evil to let them continue to exist. I dedicated my life to destroying the Domination.' \&quot;\n'You admire Neitzsche?'\n'He was crazy. Let's just say I have less contempt for him, and for Desade, then I have for most intellectuals.' \&quot; [See also pg. 239.]\n--Friedrich Nietzsche \&quot;\nNietzsche, continued&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://adherents.com/lit/Na/Na_356.html&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:12:13&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:48,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;SARANAC LAKE - Historic Saranac Lake has announced the opening of a new exhibit on Saranac Lake history in the John Black Room of the Saranac Laboratory.\nThe exhibit officially opens on Wednesday with an evening gathering open to all current members of Historic Saranac Lake.\nSix large panels in the John Black Room outline the development of the village, from its early days as a small logging town to its growth as a destination for outdoor recreation and a center for scientific research and patient care. The final panel explores the village's effort to find new life after the decline of the tuberculosis industry. Interspersed among the exhibit panels are historic photos on loan from the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library.\nA jitney from Trudeau Sanitarium is parked in front of Leonard’s Department Store on Main Street at Broadway.(Photograph 83.801, courtesy of the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library)\n\&quot;Hundreds of visitors come here each year eager to learn more about the community,\&quot; Historic Saranac Lake Executive Director Amy Catania said in a press release. \&quot;This new exhibit will orient visitors to our fascinating history and help them understand who we are today. They are beautiful panels that really bring to life our local history.\&quot;\nHistoric Saranac Lake plans to supplement the new panels with more artifacts and interpretation. The organization is raising funds to allow for the installation of case lighting and an expansion of this first phase of the exhibit.\nFive of the panels feature large historic photographs courtesy of the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library. The final panel features a present day photo provided by Saranac Lake photographer Mark Kurtz.\nThe planning and design of the exhibit was supported by a Museumwise Get Set grant and by grants from the New York Council for the Humanities. The exhibit script was written by Field Horne in consultation with local history experts and Christopher Clarke. Kevan Moss Design led the planning effort and the design of the John Black Room panels. The fabrication of the exhibit panels was supported by a donation from a friend of Historic Saranac Lake, Henry Parnass.\nThe main laboratory space also features new interpretation for the summer season. Designer Karen Davidson created an exhibit panel interpreting the architecture of the Trudeau Sanatorium and another panel showing the human lungs that once lined the basement shelves. Visitors can tour a new \&quot;cure room\&quot; displaying artifacts such as a cure chair, medicines and medical devices that were a part of the patient experience.\nFounded in 1980, Historic Saranac Lake is an architectural preservation organization that captures and presents local history from its center at the Saranac Laboratory Museum.\nThe museum is open year-round, Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and also on Saturdays through Oct. 6. Admission is $5, and members and children are free.\nFor more information visit or call 518-891-4606.\n54 Broadway , Saranac Lake, NY 12983 | 518-891-2600\n© 2013.

But this draft presents can prove to be an opportunistic time for our Jaguars.\nSince the season ended we have heard all-knowing know-nothings say that the team will pick Justin Blackmon, Melvin Ingram, Quinton Coples or Michael Floyd. I however agree with those that feel the Jaguars will trade back and acquire more draft picks.\nAs of right now the team does need to upgrade the defensive line and the wide receiver corps. Honestly, I have not been blown away by any particular wide receiver in this draft and think that equal value for that position (should the Jaguars choose to pull the trigger on a receiver) can be found later in the first round. That was my suggestion of Jacksonville thinking about Reuben Randle or Stephen Hill.\nSo what would make me happy this draft? Us finding and coaxing this year’s version of the Atlanta Falcons to give up numerous picks for our seventh. It might not be as much as the Falcons relinquish last year to get Julio Jones, unless Tannehill is still available, but a nice version of a First Coast Stimulus Package would be quite nice. No, I’m not a politician by any stretch of the word.\nBut, these are my thoughts. And whether we agree to disagree on the issue or are on the same page, it is certain that a few new rookies will be coming to an NFL franchise near you.\nOh, and let’s try to allow the rookies to get their team gear and lockers before we rip to shreds this season. Much obliged readers, much obliged.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://aeryssports.com/roaring-black-n-teal/tag/sports/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:21:34&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:54,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;UNESCO AND ISRAEL\nWHEREAS, UNESCO adopted a resolution at its 18th General Conference in November 1974 excluding Israel from any regional grouping and from eligibility for appropriations, and,\nWHEREAS, the use of UNESCO by any country or block of countries to further their own political purposes is repugnant to the stated ideals of that organization,\nTHEREFORE, the American Ethical Union strongly urges the Member States to reconsider the implications of their actions at said Conference, so that UNESCO's worthy program and philosophy can be reaffirmed and put back and thus strengthen UNESCO and the United Nations.\nSubmitted and Approved by the\nAEU Public Affairs Committee\nAdopted by the AEU Assembly, Westbury, N.

Whenever I have a problem, a challenge or am faced with anything in life, my grandmother has the same advice every single time.\n“Don’t think about it,” she says, with the wave of a hand. “Just do it.”\nI know it sounds … like a sneaker ad… But it’s really good advice and it seems to crop up when I least expect it.\nBut her voice crept into my head not long ago when management let the residents of my apartment complex know that they would be conducting their annual inspections recently. It’s funny how content one can be being incredibly messy – until one is going to have people in her dwelling space.\nMy spare room was, at one time, used for guests. But over time, as my schedule got busier and guests became more sporadic it went from spare room to catchall. There are extra lamps, a television, my desk (which sadly does not get used enough), a guest bed, boxes (and boxes) of notebooks and … well you get the idea.\nSome people like to make an organized plan of cleaning. In some cases, that’s my plan of action. While I have a particular method to cleaning the kitchen, it’s a completely different story when it comes to the rest of the house.\nDon’t think about it, just do it…\nEven with a weekend chock full of things to do, physical fitness training, wrapping up work items that didn’t get done from the week, writing articles for other outlets that need to be finished by their deadline, I dropped everything suddenly and cleaned out that room.\nAnd it wasn’t just a surprise – it was a relief. Until the other day, I never opened the door to that room to hide the mess. Now, I don’t mind going in there.\nI might even clean my bedroom.\nI said ‘might.’\nCleaning for Travel\nI travel quite a bit for work. Not too much, but just enough that returning to my own apartment can sometimes be the sweetest feeling in the world. Or, depending on its cleanliness, make me yearn to be back on the road, in the comforts of a generic hotel room, orderly and sterile-ish.\nLast week I spent several days in Las Vegas for a convention at the Venetian. I left on a Sunday and spent the entire morning packing and picking up around my apartment. My place looked presentable…but for some reason that wasn’t good enough. I think deep down I knew I couldn’t spend a week in Vegas – of all places – and come home to an apartment that was unclean.\nI decided to finally get to all the hard-to-reach places and pain-in-the-neck tasks that are so often neglected. I broke out the Cooktop cleaner. Scrubbed the bathroom. Even cleaned out the refrigerator. It was possibly the most productive few hours I’ve ever spent during a weekend.\nSo when I left the apartment and headed to the airport, I felt good. A little grossed out by the scrubbing and some things I found in my fridge, but overall pretty good.\nBut the big payoff was yet to come…\nWhen I arrived home after several days in Sin City and a full day of traveling back from Pacific Time, I was so relieved to have an apartment worth coming home to. It was clean, it smelled halfway decent, and I was proud of the work I’d put in before my trip. It made it all worthwhile.\nEarly Spring Cleaning\nOf the 115 Groundhog Days on record since it began in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has only predicted an early spring 16 times. Fortunately, this year we’re lucky the groundhog did not see his shadow, so 2013 is off to a great start!\nBased on my calculations, what with the vernal equinox falling on March 20 and Phil’s gift of six weeks less of winter, that means Spring should be happening….now?\nThis is actually fantastic news. Not only because flip flops are my favorite and I will wear them as soon as my toes can tolerate the weather, but because my apartment needs a spring clean like it’s nobody’s business.\nMore often as of late, when I have people over, I feel like I’m showcasing the “fake apartment.” You know, the one that is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but heaven forbid someone opens the wrong door and ski equipment tumbles out of it (but you don’t even ski). This needs to end! And I know exactly how to put a stop to it.\nOne thing that I really need to procure is a dresser for my clothes. I don’t know how it happened, but my bedroom floor is now an extension of my closet. It’s relatively organized, but there are piles everywhere. I’ve been putting it off, but I know I need to buckle down, pick one that I like and get organized!\nDusting is also a major issue. I’m allergic to dust, so you’d think I’d have this under control, but apparently I’m a glutton for punishment. It just isn’t something that crosses my mind, coupled with the fact that I have yet to find a duster/product that I like. But I know dusting really does make a huge difference in the appearance of all surfaces so this is definitely another thing I need to tackle.\nLastly, the kitchen is always a big one. Getting grime out of those harder to reach corners and concentrating on spots that are often overlooked (I completely ignore that area underneath my dish drying rack) will definitely be a focus. I also need to actually clean the sink, not just the dirty plates in it, and give my stove a good scrub as well.\nThere’s definitely a lot to be done, but it’s totally manageable! And thanks to this year’s early spring, I’m going to get a head start on turning my “fake apartment” into a clean one.\nWork it Out, Clean it Up\nIf you’re anything like me, you probably don’t have a ton of spare time. Between work, family, social obligations, time just flies by and I hardly have a minute to myself. So what happens when your days seem to shorten and a few free minutes are tough to find? Things get prioritized, other thing get cut out entirely.\nUnfortunately for me, what ends up on the cutting room floor is usually the gym and cleaning my apartment. These routine-driven activities are just too easy to push to the side and marginalize when faced with deadlines, commitments, and other responsibilities. It’s a shame too – both activities leave you feeling refreshed and feeling better about yourself. These endeavors can put you in a better place than you were when you started, and that’s pretty hard to replace.\nSo what I do is try to combine the two. I know that sounds silly but hear me out a second. When you carve out the time to clean your apt, throw some reps in there too! For example, for every dish you scrub and dry by hand, drop and do five pushups. Vacuum for 30-seconds then do 30-seconds of jumping jacks. How about throwing in a few lunges when taking the trash out?\nWill you look like a crazy person? Maybe, but that’s for your neighbors to decide. Point is, cleaning and exercise are two aspects of your life that shouldn’t be compromised. In this month when so many New Year’s Resolutions have died or on their last legs, recommit yourself to finding the time. Ok, so maybe reaching the highest shelf to dust isn’t part of a typical yoga vinyasa, but you can get creative.\nAnd don’t worry about the neighbors; they’ll go from asking “what is she doing?” to “how does she do it?”\nDownright Domestic\nCatch Affresh this weekend on the lifestyle list tv show, Downright Domestic!

And it comes with David Card’s name right on the title page; this is certainly not a name that one associates with structural modeling!\nField experiments and randomized control trials are booming at the moment. Until the past decade, an average year saw a single field experiment published in any of the top five journals. Now, 8 to 10 a year are. The vast majority of these papers are atheoretical, though I have a small complaint about the definition of “theoretical” which I’ll leave for the final paragraph of this post. The same atheoretical nature is largely true of lab experiments; I generally am very receptive to field experiments and much less so to lab experiments, so I’ll leave out discussion of the lab for now.\n(That said, I’m curious for the lab types out there: are there any good examples of lab experiments which have overturned a key economic insight? By overturned, I mean the reversal was accepted as valid by many economists. I don’t mean “behavioral theory” like Kahneman-Tversky. I mean, an actual lab experiment in the style of the German School – we ought call it that at this point. It just seems to me like many of the “surprising” results just turn out not to be true once we move to economically relevant behavior in the market. The “gift reciprocity” paper by Fehr and coauthors is a great example, and Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier discuss it. In the lab, people “work” much harder when they get paid a surprisingly high wage. In field and natural experiments trying to replicate this, with Gneezy and List (2006) being the canonical example, there is no such economically relevant effect. I would love some counterexamples of this phenomenon, though: I’m trying my best to keep an open mind!)\nBut back to field experiments. After noting the paucity of theory in most experimental papers, the authors give three examples of where theory could have played a role. In the gift reciprocity/wages literature mentioned above, there are many potential explanations for what is going on in the lab. Perhaps workers feel inequity aversion, and don’t want to “rip off” unprofitable employers. Perhaps they simple act under reciprocity – if you pay me a high wage, I’ll work hard even in a one-shot game. A properly designed field experiment can distinguish between the two. An even better example is charitable giving. List and Lucking-Reiley ran a famous 2002 field experiment where they examined whether giving to charity could be affected by, for example, claiming in the brochure that the goal of the fundraising drive was already almost reached. But can’t we learn much more about charity? Do people give because of warm glow? Or because of social pressure? Or some other reason? List, Dellavigna and Malmendier have a wonderful 2010 paper that writes down a basic structural model of gift-giving, and introduces just enough randomization into the experimental design to identify all of the parameters. They find that social pressure is important, and that door-to-door fundraising can actually lower total social welfare, even taking into account the gain from purchasing whatever public good charity is raising money for. And their results have a great link back to earlier theory and to future experiments along similar lines. Now that’s great work!\nThe complaints against structural models always seemed hollow to me. As Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier note, when interpreting results, every paper, structural or not, is making implicit assumptions. Why not make them in a way that is both clear and is guided by the huge body of theoretical knowledge that social science has already developed? The authors note a turn away from structural models in experiments after the negative income tax papers of the 70s and 80s were thought to be failures in some sense due to the difficulty of interpreting their results. This argument was always a bit ridiculous: all social science results are hard to interpret, and there’s no way around this. Writing up research in a way that it seems more clearcut to a policy audience does not mean that the evidence actually is clearcut.\nI do have one quibble with this paper, though – and I think the authors will sympathize with this complaint given their case studies. The authors divide experimental papers into four groups: descriptive, single model, competing model and parameter estimation. Single model, to take one example, is defined as a paper that lays out a formal model and tests one or more implications thereof. Similar definitions are given for competing models and parameter estimations. Once we get over Friedman’s 1953 model of economic methodology, though, we’ve got to realize that “testing” models is far, far away from the only link between theory and data. Theory is useful to empirics because it can guide interesting and nonobvious questions to look for, because it can be used to justify nontestable econometric assumptions, because it allows for reasonable discussion of counterfactuals, because it allows empirical studies to be linked into a broader conception of knowledge, because it allows for results to be interpreted correctly, etc. I’d argue that checking whether papers “test” models is almost irrelevant for knowing whether empirical papers properly use theory. Let me give my favorite example, which I used in a presentation to empirical economists last year. Imagine you study government-mandated hospital report cards, and find that two years into the program, there is no evidence that hospitals or patients are changing behavior based on the ratings, but that 20% of patients were looking at the report cards at some point. An atheoretical paper might suggest that these report card programs are a waste of money. A theoretically-guided paper would note that game theorists have shown reputational equilibria often are discontinuous, and that perhaps if more patients were induced to look at the report cards (maybe by directly mailing them to each household once a year), hospitals would begin to react by giving better care. There is no testing of a theoretical model or anything similar, but there is certainly great use of theory! (Perhaps of interest: my two favorite job market papers of the last couple years, those of Ben Handel and Heidi Williams, both use theory in one of the ways above rather than in the direct “let’s use data to test a theoretical model” framework…)\nSimilar comments apply to theorists’ use of empirical research, of course, but let’s save that for another day. (February 2011 working paper – forthcoming in the JEP)\nHi, I’m a recent PhD graduate from a “behavioral economics” graduate program–just wanted to reply about your quip about lab experiments.\nFirst one funny story—Norbert Schwarz, a fairly famous social psychologist, was giving a talk at Harvard’s experimental/behavioral econ seminar about 2 years ago. He was presenting some findings on accessibility (e.g. that easy to pronounce stock market ticker names did better at IPO—how’s that for market relevance?) and received the standard econ question about incentives and whether that would change his observed lab experiment. Upon which he remarked, “have incentives ever really been shown to truly change a bias once it is demonstrated in the lab? can you take even one important bias and show that it goes away?” Apparently he’s not familiar with John List’s work\nI don’t believe anyone in the audience replied–Ed Glaeser didn’t come that day, else I’m sure he would have made a caustic retort.\nBut to you I would direct a similar critique. There are numerous examples of biases that don’t change in the face of market incentives. Medical decision making is one place where it’s very difficult to square people’s choices with a rational model. I would check out some of Peter Ubel’s work in that vein. But to offer you a better example–how about this QJE paper of Ariely and Loewenstein on Coherent Arbitrariness. You have a lab study that essentially creates a market and shows that anchoring effects are not altered by market exchange. In general many of the canonical biases in Kahneman and Tversky don’t seem to change very much in the face of incentives–Holt and Laury’s paper on risk aversion comes to mind. So I think there are problems on both sides.\n(Not to mention the methodological issues with trusting studies in each camp–theres plenty of con in econometrics, and plenty of file drawer and other dirty secrets in social psych– the researcher degrees of freedom problem to me presents the most serious problem in trying to\nunderstand what papers have the most external validity)\nCoherent Arbitrariness:\n(though here’s one replication failure for more common market goods:\nI’ve run anchoring studies and found them to be pretty stable–friends as well)\nRisk Aversion:\nI’d be curious to know what you think…\nOh yeah, one more obvious example comes to mind…all of Thaler’s stuff on default effects on retirement decisions. People have huge incentives to be rational there, but don’t seem to be…\nThanks for the citations, Paul. I’ll definitely check them out. Concerning Thaler and retirement, though, I suppose I question the extent to which lab studies about anchoring “convinced” the profession rather than simple evidence of the choices people actually make with their retirement accounts. Two followups to that statement: first, I have nothing against “behavioral economics” per se – it’s clearly useful – but I’m less sold on the lab experimental method of behavioral social science. Second, you might wonder why I care about whether A or B is found convincing by the profession. I’ve written a few times here that I subscribe to a philosophy of science that puts a ton of weight on subjective judgment of quality of research by practitioners, so I actually think the question of credit is pretty important here.\nI’m with you that there certainly need be more conversations between different methodological schools, however. I’m sure Ed would have been caustic upon hearing Schwarz’ remark, and I recall a lecture here at NW by Ernst Fehr where that eminence grise was nearly driven out the room with pitchforks.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/the-role-of-theory-in-field-experiments-d-card-s-dellavigna-u-malmendier-2011/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:12:40&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:57,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;IPv4 Allocation Policy\n1) Abstract\nThis document describes the guidelines for IPv4 address allocation and assignment in the AFRINIC service region (Africa and Part of the Indian Ocean) .They have been developed through an open, bottom up policy development process of AFRINIC's Policy Working Group.\n2) Introduction\nAFRINIC (The African Network Information Center) is a non-for-profit independent organisation serving as one of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR's). Its service region incorporates the African continent and part of the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros). AFRINIC is responsible for the allocation of IP (Internet Protocol) address space, AS (Autonomous System) Numbers and management of reverse domain names within the region.\n3) Scope\nThis document describes policies for the responsible management of unique IPv4 address space in the AFRINIC region. The policies in this document apply to all IPv4 allocations and assignments within the AFRINIC service region and must be implemented by all AFRINIC's Local Internet Registries.\nThis document does not describe policies related to IPv6, AS numbers, private addresses and in-addr.arpa domains. These policies can be found at\nIt does not describe conditions of AFRINIC membership decribed at nor does it examine the policies of the other Regional Internet Registries.\n4) IPv4 address space\nFor the purpose of this document, IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary numbers (used as identifiers in the IPv4 protocol) and are usually in three types:\na. Public/global IP addresses that are assigned to be globally unique according to the goals described in section 6 of this document..\nc. IP ranges reserved for experiments: These are described in RFC3330 (). Some ranges are also reserved for multicast.\n5) Hierarchy of address space distribution\nIP addresses are distributed in an hierarchical structure in which IANA (The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates address space to AFRINIC, to be redistributed throughout the African region. AFRINIC allocates address space to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and also delegates to them the authority to make assignments and sub-allocations. LIRs sub-allocate and assign address space to their customers in accordance with the policies and procedures described in this document.\n6) Definitions\nThe following terms and their definitions are of particular importance to the understanding of the goals, environment, and policies described in this document.\n6.1 Internet Registry (IR)\nAn Internet Registry (IR) is an organization that is responsible for distributing IP address space to its customers and for registering those addresses. IRs are classified according to their primary function and territorial scope within the hierarchical structure.\n6 four RIRs: APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC. AFRINIC is the fifth\n6.\n6.4 Allocation\nTo \&quot;allocate\&quot; means to distribute address space to LIRs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.\n6.5 Sub-Allocation\nTo \&quot;sub-allocate\&quot; means to distribute address space (by LIRs) to ISPs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.\n6.\n6.\n6.\n7) Goals of the Internet Registry System\n7.1 Goals\nIt is AFRINIC's primary duty, as a custodian of a public resource, to ensure that for all Ipv4 allocations and assignments, the following goals are met:\n- Uniqueness - In order that each host on the public internet can be uniquely identified, each public unicast IPv4 address must be globally unique.\n- Registration - Every assignment and allocation of public Internet address space must be registered in the AFRINIC whois database. This is necessary to ensure uniqueness and to provide information for Internet trouble shooting at all levels.\n- Aggregation - Distributing Ipv4 addresses in a hierachical manner permits the aggregation of routing information. This helps to ensure proper operation of internet routing, and to limit the expansion of Internet routing tables (RFC2519).\n- Conservation - To maximize the lifetime of the public Internet address space resource, addresses must be distributed according to actual need and on the basis of immediate use. Therefore, stockpiling of address space and maintaining reservations must, in general, be avoided.\n7.\n7.3 Documentation.\n7.4 Fairness\nAll policies and practices relating to the use of public address space will apply fairly and equitably to all existing and potential members of AFRINIC regardless of their location, nationality, size,or any other factor.\n8) Registration Requirements\na) All communication with AFRINIC will be in English.\nb) All allocations and assignments will be registered in an AFRINIC database. Any unregistered assignemnts / allocations / sub-allocaion will be considered invalid. The registration data (name, IP block/range, contacts, status, etc..) must be correct at all times. This is necessary to support network operations.\nAllocation policies and guidelines\n8.1 Introduction\nAFRINIC allocates ranges of IPv4 addresses to Local Internet Registries (LIRs). LIRs reassign or sub-allocate that space to their customers.\nAn Allocation is a range of IPv4 addresses from which sub-allocations and assignments are made. All LIR's assigning address space allocated from AFRINIC are also advised to adopt a set of policies that are consistent with the policies described in this document.. (CIDR - \&quot;Classless Inter-Domain Routing\&quot;, is exlained in RFC1517-1959,)..\n8.2 First Allocation\na) AFRINIC's minimum allocation is /22 or 1024 IPv4 addresses.\nb) The organisation must be an AFRINIC member in good standing, and\nc).\n8.3. Slow start mechanism for first allocations\nAFRINIC shall apply a slow start mechanism to all new LIRs. With respect to allocations made by AFRINIC, the first allocation an LIR receives will be the size of the minimum practical allocation described in Section 8.2 (a) unless otherwise justified.\nThe slow start policy is used by all RIR's to prevent allocations of large blocks of address space that may then remain substantially unassigned. AFRINIC implements the slow start mechanism in a consistent and fair manner for every LIR, and will apply the same principles and standards to every applicant for address space.\n8.4 Additional Allocation.\nAFRINIC will always try to allocate contiguous address ranges, allowing the LIR to minimise the number of route announcements it makes. However, it will not always be possible to allocate a range contiguous with the LIR's previous allocation.\n8.5 Sub-Allocations\nThe minimum size of a sub-allocation is /24. It allows a reasonable number of small assignments to be made by a downstream ISP. An LIR may not sub-allocate IPv4 space above its suballocation).\n9) Assignment policies and guidelines\nLIR's must request approval from AFRINIC approval for all sub-allocations above their Sub-Allocation Window (see section 10.0 for SAW policy).\nThe following guidelines are intended to help LIRs and end-users in their search for equitable compromises:\n9.1. Request forms are available at\nWhen making sub-allocation from their SAW, LIR's should also ensure that such information is given by the end-user.\n9.2.\n9.3 Utilisation\nImmediate utilisation of assignments should be at least 25% of the assigned space. After one year, unless special circumstances are defined, it should be at least 50%.\n9.4.\n9.5.\n9.6.\n10) Sub-Allocation Window (SAW)\nAn sub-allocation window (SAW) refers to the maximum number of IPv4 addresses that the LIR may sub-allocate to the end-users without seeking approval from AFRINIC. The SAW size is expressed in CIDR notatation.\nAFRINIC will review sub-allocation made by the LIR's using their SAW in to ensure that policies are followed correctly. LIR's should also ensure that documentation for sub-allocation made using the SAW be similar to that requested for larger requests.\nBelow are a few guidelines for the SAW:\n10.1 All new LIRs have a SAW of zero. All sub-allocations will need prior approval by AFRINIC.\n10.2 The LIR cannot make any sub-allocation to the end-user above their SAW in a 12 months period (1 year). At the end of a calendar year from the approval of an SAW, the SAW is refreshed for one more year. In case the LIR's SAW is exhausted for a particular end-user, approval must be sought from AFRINIC for any other sub-allocation to the same end-user.\n10.3.\n10.4.\n12) Abbreviations\n- AFRIN Aggregateable\n- PI Provider Independent\n- RIR Regional Internet Registry\n13) Useful links\n- RFC documents:\n- IANA web site:&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://afrinic.net/en/services/rs/membership-types/126-policy-ipv4-address-allocation-policies&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:20:28&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;/templates/rt_nexus_j15/images/arrow.png&quot;,null],[&quot;/templates/rt_nexus_j15/images/arrow.png&quot;,null]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;/templates/rt_nexus_j15/images/arrow.png\&quot;,\n    null\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;/templates/rt_nexus_j15/images/arrow.png\&quot;,\n    null\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:58,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Scattered around writing blogs is the sage advice along the lines of “3 Ways of Writing a Killer First Line,” or “The Top 10 First Lines of a Novel” or “How to Hook Your Reader in the First Line.”\nI have a problem with this. I don’t read the first line of a new novel and stop, judging its worth and merit on a single sentence alone.\nI liken it to looking at a Van Gogh painting and focusing on a single brush stroke and missing the beauty and grandeur of the night sky.\nA great first line can hook you in. But it’s when you understand it within the context of the first paragraph, the first page, the first chapter through to the closing line of the novel that its true power and beauty is revealed.\nI read beyond the first line. I want to be caught up in the artistry of the writer, from the first line to the first paragraph to the first page to the first chapter to the closing line; to have the sentences form sedimentary layers over me as I delve into the artistry of the written word. Or like being covered in a large bucket of spaghetti, tangled in the complexity and power of words (you chose which simile works best for you).\nThe first sentence encapsulates the power, breadth, beauty and depth of a novel. It retains its power because the remainder of the novel bears out the enormity and scope hinted at in the first line.\nBut every sentence must work for the reader. Every sentence must be crafted as delicately and intricately as the first.\nStand back and admire the beauty of the whole. Then step closer and examine the individual brush strokes to understand why it has captured your imagination.\nI used to write “clever” titles for blog posts and bizarre / “captivating” first paragraphs – I learned it really hindered technical writing LOL. I like opening gambits that make you want to sit in a corner and read the whole thing undisturbed. I notice however that some of the most innocuous opening sentences are the best. Cheap theatrics like ‘compelling’ first sentences have more to do with the way blog posts appear on a web page more than literature – and even less to do with the reality of the writing it often turns out.\nYou know, it’s terrifying to comment on Adam’s posts because I become acutely aware my grammar and syntax may not pass scrutiny.\nIt’s teh interwebz. No one cares about syntax or grammar, only trolling\nBlogging can have cheap theatricality, but I write from an essayist’s perspective (curse of being an English teacher)\nThat was another excellent post today. Thanks so much for sharing. Keep up the fantastic job.\nEnjoy writing?\nFeel free to join our writing group – It’s worth getting into. They pay very well also.\nJoin Today – Writers Wanted\nI don’t stop reading after the first sentence either, unless it’s a really bad first sentence.\nI like to try and write good first lines but you’re right, they’re not the be-all and end-all. I think a good first few paragraphs are a more solid foundation, but I can’t help thinking that a coherent style, a solid structure and an interesting plot are more important. That said, I often write my first line last, after I know what is to come, so the first few lines can act as a better statement of intent.\nThere is a lot of buzz about first lines right now and it’s interesting to look at them on their own, but you’re absolutely right, they are only as good as the sentence that follows. When choosing a new book, I’ll give it at least one page, but if I’m not pulled in by something, no matter how good the blurb is, I won’t buy it.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://afullnessinbrevity.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/the-first-line-conundrum/&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:13:07&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g&quot;,&quot;:)&quot;]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g\&quot;,\n    \&quot;:)\&quot;\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:59,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Credit Team\nForest.\n:\n- quarterly newsletter, The Forest Focus (PDF, 242k).

From this strong foundation these students will be able to attend college and embark on their dream profession.\nDr. Sadie Mitchell, Associate Superintendent for Elementary Education, acknowledged the enormity of the project and the district's dedication to its success, \&quot;One block at a time....We will have a 'whatever it takes' attitude.\nThe start-up grant will give UALR and its partners a year to prepare for the full-scale implementation of a program aimed at replicating the kind of private-public partnerships that made the Harlem Children’s Zone a model to provide children in the neighborhood “whatever it takes” to raise them up from babyhood to college..&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://agnolia.gay@lrsd.org/news/post.cfm/lr-partners-awarded-promise-grant&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:21:19&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:61,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Spencer &amp; Hat Sept 2, 2012 16:58:46 GMT -5 Quote Select PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top Post by irishnurse68 on Sept 2, 2012 16:58:46 GMT -5 This set is so pretty!

The pepper vines actually bear fruit—small white flowers that turn into berries called peppercorns. Manufacturers take the peppercorns and collect them as whole berries or as ground black pepper.\nResearch studies have shown that black pepper actually has healthful properties such as:\n· It is its ability to enhance the function of the digestive tract that makes it a good reason to put it in the dishes you cook.\n· Diminish the amount of gas in the intestinal tract. This leads to less flatulence and bloating and is believed to be another benefit of increasing hydrochloric acid in the stomach.\n· Has a great amount of antioxidant properties.\n· Benefits against bacterial growth, particularly in the intestinal tract.\nThe good news is that all you need to do is put a little bit in your food every day.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://aicaculinary.com/index.php?comp=com_blog_details&amp;id=46&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:53:22&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;administrator/uploads/blog/full/1341903013.jpg&quot;,null]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;administrator/uploads/blog/full/1341903013.jpg\&quot;,\n    null\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-319673092013-02-25T17:50:04.874-05:00Aimless<a href=\&quot;\&quot;><img alt=\&quot;[Aimless Blog Front Page]\&quot; src=\&quot;\&quot;></a> <br>The Adventures of an American Vagabond <br>(&amp; stories from ridiculously long walks)Ryan M.

Soho has 28 locations in Sao Paulo, and serves more than 700,000 customers annually.\nOn Jan. 10, during a brief trip to Japan, Iijima visited hair salon 'imaii,' where he learned his trade. It was the first time he had returned there in more than a decade. Despite dredging through his memories, he had a hard time remembering exactly where the place was. Suddenly, he came to a standstill in front of a leaning power pole, rubbing his hands as he spoke.\n\&quot;This is it, right here. I was brought here several times a day to be scolded beside this power pole in front of the salon.\&quot;\nImaii, which has a floor space of only six tsubo (just under 20 square meters), is now located in a fashionable building that stands diagonally across from the power pole. Its proprietor, Hideo Imai, trained at the Vidal Sassoon salon in the United States in the 1970s, and is responsible for popularizing the innovative \&quot;Sassoon cut\&quot; in Japan.\nBefore joining Imai's salon, Iijima had already worked at several other establishments and become a competent hair stylist, but was troubled by a lack of confidence in his skills. Then one day he saw a magazine article about Imai who had just returned to Japan, and wasted no time in asking him for a job.\n\&quot;Mr. Imai was strict, but I acquired the kind of skills and theory that I could be satisfied with, and I gained confidence in my abilities,\&quot; Iijima says.\nBefore he knew it, he had become a popular hair stylist.\nThere was no end to customers requesting Iijima's services, and in one month alone he cut the hair of 760 clients. His days off were spent traveling the country to give seminars for hairdressers, and magazines and industry shows eagerly sought his expertise. Eventually, his monthly wages topped 1 million yen ($12,000).\n\&quot;He brought us more business not only with his hairdressing talent, but also his cheerful conversational skills,\&quot; Imai recalls.\nHowever, after about five years, Iijima called time out on his career as a \&quot;charismatic hairdresser.\&quot; He accepted an invitation from one of his former trainees who was managing a hair salon in Brazil, and emigrated there with his wife, 4-year-old son, and infant daughter. He was 28.\n\&quot;I had dreamed of moving overseas since I was little,\&quot; he says. \&quot;If I had stayed where I was, I thought I'd most likely end up regretting it.\&quot;\n* * *\nAdjusting to life in another country wasn't easy.\nHe found himself at odds with his former trainee, and was fired after two years. The 10 million yen he had saved in Japan soon ran out. He borrowed three mirrors, and decided to test his mettle by working at a local salon.\nFor him, it was like a battleground.\nThe most senior hairdresser took the position closest to the salon's entrance, and newcomer Iijima was given the spot farthest back. Even if a customer came in without an appointment, they rarely made it into Iijima's chair. Names of non-existent clients were written in his column on the salon's appointment board, as well as other tricks intended to prevent him from gaining actual business. It was the underhanded work of his colleagues.\n\&quot;I live off my daily income. I wish I had the stability of a fixed salary, like office workers do,\&quot; Iijima lamented to his neighbor, Kenichi Shiomi, who worked for the local subsidiary of The Bank of Tokyo (currently Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ).\nShiomi, now 64, remembers it so well because Iijima wasn't the type to feel sorry for himself. His oldest son, Dai, 37, agrees.\n\&quot;At the time, my father didn't understand much Portuguese,\&quot; Dai says. \&quot;I think he couldn't communicate well with his customers, which must have really bothered him.\&quot;\nOne day, Iijima came up with a plan. The shampoo sink was at the rear of the salon, so every customer had to pass by him. He carved his name into an eraser and made a stamp, then used it to add his name to the salon's business cards that he handed out to customers. Each time he would make a pitch for himself in broken Portuguese, saying, \&quot;I'm Iijima from overseas.\&quot;\nIn order to make himself stand out while cutting a client's hair, he deliberately exaggerated his movements, clicking his fingers and flattering customers by saying things like \&quot;Fantastic!\&quot; to put them in a good mood.\nTo make allies of the salon's assistants and coffee-making staff, he gave them money on the sly. This used up a third of his wages.\n* * *\nWhen Iijima began to consider striking out on his own, he remembered a certain prophecy: \&quot;Your life will change when you turn 32.\&quot;\nIt had been told to him by a client who read his fortune soon after he came to Brazil. Believing it, he opened a hair salon in an office district on his 32nd birthday, which attracted a clientele of businessmen. He opened at 9 a.m., and stayed open for as long as he had customers. Some days he even worked until 1 a.m. Within seven months, he had paid back the $90,000 he had borrowed from his friends and was eventually able to expand to a chain of shops.\nTwo days before his 40th birthday, in September 1990, Iijima awoke to discover that he had lost his sight. He had no idea why, and even wondered if he was about to die. After much agonizing, he came to accept that his fate was still his own, even if his luck had abandoned him.\nWhen he made the decision to retire from hairdressing and just manage his Soho shops, he regained his sight, but only in his right eye.\n\&quot;Maybe it was because I'd taken a load off my mind,\&quot; he says.\nThree years later, thieves broke into his home. A gun was pressed against his temple and his neck was slit with a knife. He barely escaped death by handing over his money and valuables.\nAfter this string of nightmarish incidents, Iijima came to regard his life beyond the age of 40 as a bonus.\nAt the time, Brazil was wracked by inflation and the price of living escalated rapidly. The government froze savings accounts, which caused cash flow problems. While several of his rivals gradually went out of business, Iijima raised his prices almost every week and just managed to stay afloat.\nTraining his 1,100 staff members also posed difficulties.\n\&quot;Many Brazilians don't think ahead, so it was difficult for them to understand what I meant when I talked about having dreams,\&quot; he says. \&quot;It was a near-impossible task to improve their skills on an ongoing basis.\&quot;\nBut Iijima himself has an awkward side and maneged to turn his complex into a driving force. He is aware of how others feel when they fail to accomplish something. Gradually, people began to flock to him.\n\&quot;If you stay true to yourself and have a purpose, it gives you the courage to confront adversity,\&quot; he says. \&quot;I'll keep doing things the Iijima way until I die.\&quot;\n* * *\nHideaki Iijima\nBorn in 1950 in Saitama Prefecture. Graduated from Kodama High School in Saitama, and gained his hairdressing license in 1970. Worked for several salons in metropolitan Tokyo before joining Hideo Imai's studio in Harajuku. Received acclaim for his hair-cutting techniques, becoming a popular stylist. Described as one of the first \&quot;charismatic hairdressers.\&quot; Emigrated to Sao Paulo in 1979. Opened salon Soho in Sao Paulo in 1982, and turned it into Brazil's second-largest hair salon chain.\nMemo\nFamily: Iijima divorced six years ago, and is currently single. He lives with his eldest son, Dai, and his wife, to whom he handed over the management of his salon business five years ago. His eldest daughter, Ai, also lives in Sao Paulo. His two children were born when he was still living in Japan, but he had the intention of moving overseas one day, \&quot;so I gave them names that could be easily pronounced by non-Japanese.\&quot;\nMotivation: Iijima's father ran a barbershop in Saitama that his eldest brother eventually took over, so he became a hairdresser to avoid becoming a commercial rival. He always used his favorite Japanese-made Tenyo scissors, which he sharpened himself.\nOn weekdays from 4:30 a.m., for an hour and a half, Iijima helps clean a park near his home. He has never missed a day in the past 15 years.\n- « Prev\n- 1&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://ajw.asahi.com/article/globe/people/AJ201203250020&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:41:04&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:69,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Another Movie Guy?: \&quot;Funny People,\&quot; \&quot;Burma VJ,\&quot; misc.Posted: July 31st, 2009 | Filed under: Uncategorized | Comments Off\nWelcome to”Another Movie Guy?”! This week I wondered whether I’d be able to find a connection between two new releases, Funny People and Burma VJ. One is a documentary about journalists who expose the truth about a military junta, whereas the other is a comedy about ill-behaved comedians. After Funny People, I left the theater in a beleaguered state, and it dawned on me that both movies are about forty minutes too long. Moreover, I wanted to like them more than I did. Unfortunately, the respective directors had too much faith in weak material.\nTwo weeks ago I had the opportunity to watch an open mic night. Several comedians performed, including one who embarrassingly bombed. At first the audience gave him the benefit of a doubt. Then he began a tedious bit about plastic surgery, and good will gave way to jeers and sarcastic laughter. The comedian’s only recourse was to discuss his insecurities and to insult the audience. Such a breakdown informed my thoughts on Funny People, Judd Apatow’s ambitious new comedy. It shrewdly examines a man who only knows how to be funny and mean, and what might happen if he’s forced to take stock of his life. The result is honest, yes, but not particularly rewarding. Short on laughs and long on running time, Apatow’s third directorial effort falters.\nAdam Sandler stars as George Simmons, a sellout comedic actor who gains massive wealth with high-concept Hollywood garbage (not unlike Sandler himself). Leaving his mansion for the doctor’s office, George gets bad news: he has a rare blood disease, and the experimental treatment he’s given only has an eight percent success rate. Without friends, Simmons wanders to a comedy club, a place where he can be honest and people might listen. There he meets Ira (Seth Rogen), a struggling comedian who is jealous of his successful roommates (Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman). Much to Ira’s surprise, he’s asked by George to write some jokes for an upcoming corporate event. Ira agrees, and quickly becomes George’s confidant/whipping boy. Abusing the younger comedian is not rewarding enough, so George turns to Laura (Leslie Mann), his One Who Got Away. She still has feelings for George, and the two even consider a future together. Too bad Laura’s Australian husband (Eric Bana) is in the way.\nFunny People is clearly more ambitious than Apatow’s prior movies, and here he overreaches. The problem is not with the actors. Rogen successfully plays a goofball who has trouble handling a serious situation. Sandler plays a character not unlike his roles from the mid-90s; like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Simmons can be obnoxious and cruel, with little empathy for others. Unlike Sandler’s goofy characters, George’s bad behavior has real consequences, and he’s a believable jackass. Some moments, particularly as Ira and George get to know one another, Sandler notably juxtaposes humor and buried pain. Still, the problem is that Funny People lacks the warm emotional core found in The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Apatow’s characters are realistic and their drama is authentic, yet that does not engender an overwrought climax.\nThe sequence in question is a long weekend at Laura’s home. Even if it gives Leslie Mann (Apatow’s wife) a chance to really act, the climax becomes tedious. Character choices are unclear, and too often these scenes announce emotion instead of showing it. The vulgar best friends, usually an Apatow highlight, are unfunny because they’re too selfish in such a dramatic universe (this is especially true during Ira’s romantic subplot, which never gains speed). Oh, and there are numerous cameos, from celebrities and up-and-comers alike, and their clever one-liners cannot save the exacerbating final scenes. Perhaps Apatow loves his movie too much to pare it down. Like the characters of Funny People, comedians are great company when they’re on point. When they’re not funny, their company can be almost unbearable, especially with a two and a half hour running time.\nWith Burma VJ, director Anders Østergaard tries to accomplish a noble thing with meager material. Late in the summer of 2007, Burma saw the beginnings of an uprising, one that eventually escalated to violence. After the 1988 riots left hundreds dead, the Burmese were too afraid to speak out. Everyone considers the monks a legitimate political force, so when they protest nearly 20 years later, ordinary citizens take to the streets. Østergaard documents the uprising with the help of undercover journalists (like the recent Tehran protests, borders were closed to foreign press). Using the pseudonym Joshua, a journalist serves as narrator, and is never shown on camera. He describes how he and his colleagues would risk their lives for newsworthy images. Secret police scatter throughout the city, and Joshua can never be sure when they will spot him. As the conflict escalates, Joshua flatly notes that more deaths are the only way to stir global conscience.\nThe principle weakness with Burma VJ is the quality of the smuggled footage. Joshua and others had to contend with military police and omnipresent fear, and it follows they could not always get the best shot. I realize the journalists were brave and did the best they could, yet they give Østergaard little to work with, and so his documentary lacks emotional power. At the height of the protests, for example, a journalist snags a shot of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (recent Gandhi prize winner), who has been living under house arrest. It should be a climactic, stirring moment, one that inspires others to act. Joshua says the image is blurry and the woman is at a distance, yet is moved to tears. Audience members lack Joshua’s immediate investment in the struggle, and will not have a similar reaction. That is not to say, however, that all the footage is uninspiring. Journalists catch moments when ordinary Burmese proclaim their desire for martyrdom, and there is suspense as a journalist hides from gunfire. Some especially stirring shots capture the scope of the protests. Østergaard and Joshua have moving stuff, just not enough for a feature-length documentary.\nThat’s it for this week’s “Another Movie Guy?”! Tune in next week when romantic comedy overload continues.&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://alanzilberman.com/?m=200907&quot;},&quot;timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2013-05-18T10:30:22&quot;},&quot;dump&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CC-MAIN-2013-20&quot;},&quot;segment&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1368696382261&quot;},&quot;image_urls&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[[&quot;http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/funny_people_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;funny_people_1&quot;],[&quot;http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/10217-569x318.jpg&quot;,&quot;10217&quot;]],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  [\n    \&quot;http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/funny_people_1.jpg\&quot;,\n    \&quot;funny_people_1\&quot;\n  ],\n  [\n    \&quot;http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/10217-569x318.jpg\&quot;,\n    \&quot;10217\&quot;\n  ]\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:70,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Like A Lion – Daniel Bashta (B)\nGod Is Able – Hillsong (B)\n- The Same Love – Paul Baloche (B)\nHoly – Matt Redman (B)\n- Because Of Your Love – Phil Wickham (B)\nClick on the PDF icons to download the chords.\nClick the pdf icons above to download the song chords.\nA great Sunday at STORYCHURCH.

Here’s some sort or recaps and tidbits for last week’s episode: 5. Rice Capades – I don’t really know where to begin with talking about Phillip this week. I know that I certainly don’t want to use the c-word to describe Phillip’s behavior. However, through all of the histrionics in this episode, one thing is clear: You can no longer make the argument that Phillip is playing a game with any sort of strategy.
Phillip told us last week that his intention was to get Boston Rob to want Phillip next to him at the end of the game. However, at this point Phillip is not showing any signs that winning this game is his objective at all. Phillip is certainly entitled to having an opinion and feeling the way he does but part of being a good Survivor player is occasionally hiding your feelings in the interests of winning the game. Phillip’s aggressive behavior has all but assured himself a zero percent chance at the million dollars. Even if Phillip makes it to the final three, he would need five votes to win the game. Considering that there will likely be five Zapatera tribe members on the jury, this incident is going to stick to Phillip like a certain color on rice.
4. The Great Divide – Besides for Phillip, I think the most unique thing about this season of Survivor is the lack of a merge. Oh, it technically happened, but this is the only season of Survivor I can remember where the merged tribe not only has a separate alliance but separate shelters and separate food rations too. Actually, this isn’t that uncommon, I know a lot of people in bad marriages who live the same way. The big question going forward will be how much will the Zapateras hold Boston Rob accountable for being shut out to this degree? Phillip has done a lot to take the heat off of Rob but don’t be surprised if at the end of the game, the Zapatera tribe continues to act as a group and completely vote together for whomever treated them best – which is why I maintain one of the three Ometepe women have a great shot to win this game.
3. Saving Sheppard – This season, I have spent much more time breaking down Boston Rob’s decisions in the game than any of the other players. In my opinion, Rob has far more control in this game than any other Survivor may have had at this point in history. Since Rob is controlling the vote, did Rob make the right move by keeping Phillip this week? On the one hand, he realizes that getting rid of Phillip would end a lot of the drama around camp and may even create some goodwill among the remaining Zapateras. Instead, Rob chose to keep Phillip around for another week and I agree with his decision. Phillip Sheppard is the best thing that happened to Boston Rob this season because Phillip’s distractions keep everybody from thinking about the game. When Phillip is going off about rice, feathers or kung fu, nobody is ever asking themselves about their position in the tribe or some big move they’re going to make – and that’s exactly how Boston Rob wants it to be.
2. Tribal Counseling – It was no surprise that the feud between Phillip and Steve spilled over in to this week’s tribal council. I thought that Jeff Probst showed why he is the best host on television by exploring both sides of the debate. What I still don’t understand is what happened to Phillip’s shirt? Has there ever been a Survivor contestant to attend tribal council topless before? Now with Julie gone the prospects seem pretty slim that Phillip will ever find his bathing suit. Phillip now can only hope to win a reward at some point to find the first clue to the hidden bathing suit.
1. Three’s Company – This week we had our first ever three-way duel on Redemption Island, which ended in Mike and Matt moving on and David getting eliminated. I think the top 2 people advancing at Redemption Island seems like it would help Matt in his quest to return to the game since it seems unlikely he would ever come in last (unless the duel involved having a strategy of some sort). Unfortunately, it looks like Redemption Island is starting to really take its toll on Matt. In Matt’s prayers he says that he doesn’t want to be on Survivor anymore but is simply carrying out God’s will. You would think that having an extra person on Redemption Island might help cheer Matt up a little bit, but apparently Mike Chisel isn’t that great of a roommate.

Just days after the announcement of a new Fleetwood Mac tribute album, fans can hear the first offering. ZZ Top‘s Billy Gibbons fronts a group that slows down and swampifies the 1969 hit ‘Oh Well.’
No one will accuse Gibbons, Matt Sweeney and Blake Mills of being intimidated by the already bluesy rock song. Their version is an original, born from the mud of Mississippi Delta.
This new power trio stretch a two or three minute cut (original version) to nearly five minutes of rootsy rambling with bare bones percussion and organ garnish. Gibbons is a burly behemoth on vocals, which don’t begin until almost 90 seconds into the song.
‘s ‘Oh Well’ was one from his Texas twosome’s catalog. Sweeney has another cut on ‘Just Tell Me That You Want Me,’ available Aug. 14. This song makes you want to hear it immediately.
Listen to Billy Gibbons &amp; Co., 'Oh Well'

As far as sub-literate, incomprehensible pieces of garbage are concerned, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D‘ is one of the year’s best.
With an asinine plot, risible dialogue and atrocious acting, this sequel to a half-remembered video game adaptation still manages to provide a great number of base thrills with its nightmarish imagery. As such it is a quagmire of dread both within and without, disturbing to watch and to think about. This makes for a strange alchemy: in time you identify with the lead character (a young woman in peril) not because you are engaged with the film, but because enduring such an atrocity becomes its own act of survival. How ’bout that for a neat trick, eh?
Which isn’t to say ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ isn’t gorgeous to look at. I have almost no recollection of the first film, other than a handful of striking images. That’s back again: the snow, walls of skin, faceless undead, buildings disintegrating into ash, contorted mannequins and an enormous bruiser with a metal pyramid over its head. Whether popping out of shadows for jump-scares or merely lined up in a tableaux, they are creepy and mysterious and get under your skin more so, frankly, than any other disturbing images in a mainstream horror film released this year.
Even the “normal” scenes, the blue collar town and its mundane interiors, are saturated with bright, bold colors. There’s such a fine attention to the look (and sound, if your theater has nice speakers) it is shocking that the filmmakers would allow such truly wretched dialogue.
It’s just a few scenes in, when Sean Bean is having some sort of flashback with the previous film’s Radha Mitchell, where the belly laughs come. The words trip from their mouths like when little kids pretend at acting in a classical play. But in time you’ll put together that our lead, young Adelaide Clemens (playing 17 but, no offense, she could pass for 32) [Ed. note: she's 22] must not ever, ever, ever go to the mysterious town of Silent Hill. This is made abundantly clear. Yet when strange creatures begin following her, such as twitching, skinned, faceless creatures and, worse, Martin Donovan in a ruffled raincoat, loose tie and dirty hat, it’s only a matter of time before she hits the road.
Ostensibly she’s searching for her father (Bean) who is tied up in some ‘Flash Gordon’-ish chamber, but she’ll quickly discover that her visit will lead to an epic battle between good and evil, summoning a dormant spirit and…I dunno…there’s something to do with a giant coin that, when shoved into Malcolm McDowell’s chest does something to unleash….something. Even with Jon Snow from ‘Game of Thrones‘ hammering us with exposition in a really strange Canadian accent (though the film is set within a night’s drive of West Virginia,) I’m fairly certain that there is no one person out there that can explain the entirety of the baffling plot to ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D.’ I’m sure the video game purists will delight in all the boxes that need to be ticked before elevating to the next level; the rest of us will just wonder where the hell they’re running now.
The thing is that with better acting and a reevaluation of the script, you could almost take this movie seriously. Many of the scenes have a ‘Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me’ vibe, but whereas David Lynch will intentionally derail the narrative to evoke an uncomfortable response, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ does it all au naturale. The overall disconnect (one minute an atmospheric ‘Carnival of Souls,’ the next minute unreleasable trash) is something that, I must confess, I enjoyed, but that is because I admire the occasional baffling moviegoing experience. Your mileage up this hill, as they say, may vary.
‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ is now playing in theaters.

?
Swift nabbed the numero uno slot since she earned a whopping $57 mil between May of this and last year. She can be counted on to sell about four million copies of her albums, in an age when albums don’t sell four million copies. She makes a cool milli per show, and with a CoverGirl contract, she’s golden like her curls.
Biebs, a Forbes cover boy, tallied $55 million receipts. He’s a venture capitalist in the digital realm. RiRi — a former CoverGirl herself — raked in $53 million. Album sales, tours and promo gigs, with the deep pocket likes Vita Coco and Nivea skincare, earned her this slot.
Gaga fell from grace a bit. She plummeted to No. 4, after topping the list in 2011. She dropped from $90 million to $52 million. We know, $42 million seems like a big drop, but when the average Jane makes under $100,000, it’s hard to sympathize. The reason for the drop? Less touring in 2012, so expect an increase next year, since receipts from her Born This Way Ball, which is selling out, will count towards that list.
Perry tallied $45 million from her music and touring. She won’t have to split it with ex-hubby Russell Brand, with whom she did not (!!!) have a pre-nup. That Russell is a stand up guy, and we’re not talking about his comedian gig.

Sometime in the past 24 hours, the Heck Of A Guy-produced Do I Have To Dance All Night video1 passed 30,000 views (see above screenshot). (The Heck Of A Guy video of the 1980 version of Do I Have To Dance All Night has logged 9,663 views.)
Cue the festivities: Woo Hoo
After all, 30,000 views on YouTube, a site where videos displaying cats performing cuteness beneath misspelled captions ring up millions of views isn’t much to email home about.
In fact, while an unbiased self-assessment may be intrinsically impossible, my best efforts in that spirit would hold that the personal significance of reaching this YouTube milestone breaks down to
- Self-adulatory braggadocio – 20%
- Rationalization for publishing yet another post about Do I Have To Dance All Night – 80%
Indeed, spreading the awareness of Do I Have To Dance All Night, Leonard Cohen’s dandy, underappreciated song has become a moral imperative for this site.
The title of the first Heck Of A Guy post featuring this song (on July 6th, 2006) is revelatory: Do I Have To Dance All Night – The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, I could then legitimately report
… even someone who was a Big Leonard Cohen Fan probably hadn’t heard Do I Have To Dance All Night,2AKA The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, unless he or she were
1. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who went to the right concerts in the late ’70s
or
2. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who bought his or her 45s in Central Europe
or
3..2 Indeed, Do I Have To Dance All Night was and continues to be available only as a seven inch single that was originally recorded at a 1976 concert in Paris and pressed in Holland for sale in Central European countries.3
And, I have repeatedly pointed out that this is a great, altogether wonderful Leonard Cohen.
Heck Of A Guy hosts items about the semi-funky 1976 version of the song with Laura Branigan and the 1980 more gypsy, less disco rendition, videos constructed for both of these versions (1976 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video and 1980 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video), a groom singing Do I Have To Dance All Night at his wedding reception, a Christmas download of a MP3 of the song, and 30+ more.
So, 30,000 views of a song by a singer routinely said to have a cult following, a song that singer most recently performed over 30 years ago, a song that was only briefly released in 1976 as a 7 inch single in central Europe, a song that existed on the 2006 iteration of the internet in obscure bootlegs and as a single, hideously flawed MP3 in file-sharing systems … ain’t bad.
The crusade continues.
Leonard Cohen – Do I Have To Dance All Night (1976 version)
- Do I Have To Dance All Night is also the 1st Heck Of A Guy video; there are currently more than 4o such videos dealing with Leonard Cohen. [↩]
- According to the Wikipedia, “Cohen wanted to include “Misty Blue”/”Do I Have to Dance All Night” as a free bonus single with the [Recent Songs] LP, but Columbia, his record company, rejected the idea.” [↩]
- Do I Have To Dance All Night is Side A on the single; Side B features “The Butcher,” which is available on the Songs From a Room album. [↩]
I agree, it is an addictive song. Very sexy. I wonder if LC ever hums it to himself?</span></div></div>

Was a bit skeptical about the food, but when I finally tried it out, I’m pleased to report that they do a pretty good steak! Service was also pretty decent, even though I’ve read several reviews that mention otherwise.
The steak that I ordered was the Hanging Tender $26 and it lived up to its name. Every bite was really flavourful yet tender. The only thing I didn’t like was the herb butter which I chose. I think if given the choice again, I would go for the Cabernet Sauvignon Mushroom sauce. Come to think of it, it should have been common sense to order that sauce, but I was kind of hoping that the butter would be special too. But given that the steak is so heavy already, you don’t really want more fats via the butter. On the whole, still one of the best steaks I’ve had for this price range.
The Partner had the Ribeye. He was looking for grassfed Ribeye, but the only grassfed option was for the Sirloin which he doesn’t like. still, it was a tasty Ribeye and I enjoyed stealing bits of it too. The steak fries were also very good, crispy just the way I like it.
Definitely going to come back again to Meatworks. But a huge grouse is that they don’t serve alcohol! Something along the lines of them wanting to be Halal, so the waitress said. To intensify the pain, they haven’t actually removed the alcohol page from the menu!You have to go to the supermarket on the same floor to get the wine if you need some, and corkage is charged at $20 per bottle. Steak really tastes loads better when you have a glass of wine in hand. And for some reason, I really was hankering for a glass after all that energy spent on shopping earlier. We plodded through without the wine, but certainly for the next round, I will buy a bottle or sneak one in!

I had a belated birthday celebration this year, given that my 40th birthday fell on Thanksgiving Day, 2010. While my family did a wonderful job incorporating a mini-celebration for me amongst the usual Turkey Day festivities, I never really did acknowledge the day with very much fanfare. Then six months into my 40th year I found myself presented with the rare opportunity of mixing business with pleasure and a second chance at marking a milestone year with a monumental event. At the coaxing of a colleague and friend, I said yes to taking a trip to a place that (20 years in the making) has been on my dream list of places to see in the world. This October I traveled to Cape Town, South Africa for the 2011 World Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health and below are just a few snapshots of the wonderful experience I had both professionally and personally.
Eleven days in total, half for the congress and half for exploring, the trip was both nothing and everything I could have imagined and more. The conference renewed in me my passion for medicine and reminded me of the importance and complications involved in addressing mental health issues on the larger world public health scale.
And my time spent exploring the city of Cape Town and meeting its people was absolutely thrilling. Cape Town is blessed with the most stunning natural geologic beauty but its greatest treasures, in my humble opinion, are found amongst its people, especially its artists.

McLaughlin vs Bank of America – Sandusky Woman Sues Bank of America Over “Robo-” Foreclosure
Since we are on the subject of BOA today, here is another little gem…
Sandusky woman sues bank over “robo-” foreclosure
A Sandusky woman filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming the foreclosure of her North Larchmont Drive home was spurred on by “robo-signing,” where bank employees signed affidavits without bothering to review documents.
Rhonda D. McLaughlin filed her lawsuit against Bank of America, N.A., and Rhonda Weston, a vice president of Bank of America. Fannie Mae and Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray also are named as defendants in the suit.
Sandusky attorney Dan McGookey, a foreclosure specialist, is McLaughlin’s attorney.
It may be the first lawsuit filed in the U.S. by a private citizen seeking to undo an already completed foreclosure on grounds that a robo-signer was used, McGookey said.
McLaughlin lived at 1608 North Larchmont Drive in Sandusky when Bank of America foreclosed on the home in 2007.
McLaughlin, still a Sandusky resident, lost the home when Erie County Common Pleas Court Judge Roger Binette granted a motion for summary judgment in 2008.
The summary judgment was based on an affidavit from Weston, who said McLaughlin was in default on her mortgage.
Binette has been assigned McLaughlin’s new lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges Weston was a “robo-signer” who didn’t actually review documents she referred to in her affidavit.
The suit cites news stories that say robo-signers signed thousands of affidavits each month without reviewing the mortgage documents, while banks tried to rush through as many foreclosures as possible.
The lawsuit refers to an Associated Press citing court depositions from a Florida attorney, who said employees at Bank of America and other banks commonly approved phony paperwork.
“Until now, only a handful of depositions from robo-signers have come to light,” said the Oct. 12 news story. “But the sheer volume of the new depositions will make it more difficult for financial institutions to argue that robo-signing was an aberrant practice in a handful of rogue back offices.”
McLaughlin’s lawsuit asks for Fannie Mae, now the owner of the North Larchmont Drive home, to give the home back to McLaughlin. It seeks $50,000 in damages and other costs and fees.

Rhonda D. McLaughlin vs Bank of America
I have an “Assignment” of the Security Deed only by MERS to BOA signed and dated May of 2008 and a letter from BOA in May of 2009 which states BOA was “seeking ownership but did not yet possess” an interest in the property and instructions to “get out of the house….”
MERS recorded this “Assignment” of the Security Deed ONLY in Sept 2010 and BOA then performed a non judicial sale of the property in October 2010 based on MERS assignment—–not an assignment by the original lender American Home Mortgage.
The President of BOA cannot produce the original note or an assignment of the note by the original lender and foreclosed and took possession of the property without EVER recording anything on the land records here
Can you say: “Fraud?” The documents themselves do not “sync” and in GA MERS cannot be a trustee, mortgagee, or act independently of written instructions and said docs recorded…..
I am pretty close to filing against BOA and MERS—-American Home Mortgage is defunct—so I don’t know who really owns my property, p note or security deed….
The courts have to rule on these things.
Pissed Off European ‘Lynch Mob’ Is Coming After Bank Of America
you just made me laugh… I have to read that
WESTON could not have been a VP in 2007.
I have a document that list ALL BAC “ROBO” SIGNORS on a interoffice memo ( or what looks to be ) whereby
RHONDA WESTON WAS NOT certified VP by the CORPORATION until 8/7/2009.
This document could be a get-out-of-jail free card for some people who falsified AFFIDAVITS!
My comments are redacted, this case has that document for BofA ROBO’S. Observation…….how could WESTON have claimed VP before the designation was affirmed by corporate in 2008 over a year before? Why did attorney not provide a “CHAIN OF TITLE ” ?
I think this one is in the Barn for Plaintiff! Good Luck!
do you or anyone else have a copy of the paper that she was not certified as a vp. i would love a copy! thanks!!
Good posts!!!
This is Foreclosure Terrorism. It seems obvious that the judges are lining their pockets and looking the other way. How do you define treason? Well one way would be to say that anyone, any company, any court, any entity that willfully supports Fraud on a scale as massive as this which actually puts children in the streets is directly involved with these crimes against American Home Owners. I call that treason. Where is the FBI in all of this? They just now started making arrests in a handful of cases. But this has been going on for years. What happened to law in this country? It was bought and paid for by the Wall Street Banksters. Spineless politicians are also lining their pockets to look the other way. It is no coincidence that they can’t seem to find a law to stop any of this. It is not possible that they are that incompetent. There are obviously billions in bribes going to the useless bastards who get a nice house on the hill while putting children in the streets. Stop voting Republican or Democrat. They have demonstrated that they are equally involved. It’s time to clean house. We need Joe American in the White House. A child could run a better country and still have time to play in the sandbox after lunch. J Glenn Lowe – Die Banker Die –
Agreed Glenn!!
This is most certainly treason, and should come under the heading of “Crimes Against Humanity”. Neither republican nor democrat is innocent in this mess.
This is very interesting. I’m guessing that she won’t be the last person to try this. And why shouldn’t she? If a bank did not have the proper paper work? If they forged documents? If these “Vice-Presidents” that are attesting to the authenticity of these documents are just poor, temp-employees that are signing because it’s either that or go broke and starve? If all of this “stuff” (that’s the polite word) the banks are using as proof, is all fales, then why should we or the banks just assume that they have the legal right to take anyone’s private property. I get so ANGRY! when I hear paid shills for the banks get on the radio or TV saying that we should just assume that the banks have a right even if they have been caught forging documents and lying to courts of law.</span></div></div>

The interaction designer plans for these moments. Part of their responsibility is to make all interactions positive, and includes aspects of the software, the copy-writing, the graphics, layout, flows, physical experiences. It’s a shame when one part of the experience is top notch and another is dreadful. Cohesion is important.
User experience spans multiple practices. Let’s take an example from architecture. If an architect were hired by a deep-pocketed client to create a great user experience, they wouldn’t stop at the structure in which people live. They would pay attention to the surrounding greenery, the arc of the driveway, the views of the property at each angle…maybe even the way guests are greeted and the table is set. All of these touch-points are important parts of the larger system…the house is merely one piece of the puzzle.
Web designers, traditionally secure in the role of page creators, now have a wider purview. The landscape on which people experience our design is wider than ever before. Thus, we must adapt our ways to include all aspects of experience.</span></div></div>

After rain and a backlog of matches, the Sony Ericsson decided to pluck Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic from the main stage and instead put them on Court 2. Delighted fans cheered at their luck, convinced they were waiting for the conclusion of a doubles match involving Nuria Llagostera Vives. The players were jovial, too, laughing as they walked onto the tiny court; they almost looked like dolls too big for their playhouse.
In the first set it seemed everyone was getting used to the surroundings, including the crowd. Clijsters fell hard early on and everyone screamed and then chuckled in embarrassment for the outburst. They gasped when Ivanovic hit a laser forehand and seemed concerned when Clijsters hit some of her signature splits. It was tennis’ version of keeping it real.
The level was very high in the first set. Although not the most entertaining points, many rallies ended quickly with a winner and both women held serve throughout fairly easily. Clijsters knows how to win much better than Ivanovic these days and she closed out the set in a tiebreak.
In the second with Ivanovic up 2-0, I thought about the difference between 3-0 and 2-1. Clijsters was broken in the first serving at 2-0 and it changed the set; Ivanovic held for 3-0 and pretty much rolled through the second. Funny thing about Clijsters: when she drops her level, she becomes an amateur. She lost her timing, seemed confused on the court, sprayed balls well out or mishit them so badly they landed at the service line on her side of the court. Ivanovic took the set 6-3.
The third set was all about focus. Ivanovic had it; Clijsters didn’t. The result? A quick 5-1 lead for Ivanovic and 0-40 on Clijsters’ serve. Done, right? Wrong. Typically at this point you see kids with large balls making their way to the front of the court. It’s not really possible on Court 2 but we did get a rush of photographers who swooped in to catch match point. And the newest vulture out there, Cari Champion from Tennis Channel suddenly emerged, ready to do her on-court interview.
But focus changed quickly. We’ve seen this before from both women and usually Kim wins them and Ana doesn’t. All I can say is: it went fast. Truthfully, although there was some nice play at times from both players, it wasn’t really a thrilling match until it became about nerves. Ivanovic couldn’t hit through five match points; Kim only needed one at 6-5 in the tiebreak to win it. Poor Ana.
I thought parties were supposed to be fun?</span></div></div>

Similar incidents have taken place at several other government offices this month, including the Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministries.
The internal security agency ABW had placed strict limits on Internet access at Prime Minister Donald Tusk's office after the cyber attacks were first detected.
The president's press office declined to discuss the details of the latest hacking incident, except to confirm it took place and an email with a "harmful contents" was being investigated.
Niebezpiecznik, a website specializing in covering cyber security, aid it had been contacted by a hacker using the pseudonym Alladyn2 who claimed responsibility for the attacks on government networks.
The person was quoted as saying they were only meant to test the government's ability to withstand them.
The website included several screen shots of what it said were the contents of an email account of a high ranking official at the prime minister's office and a list of passwords used by its workers.
The attacks follow similar incidents in the Czech Republic.

Join us Sunday morning at 11 for the Country Classic Spotlight. In the spotlight this weekend: Faron Young, country singer and songwriter from the early 1950′s into the mid 1980′s.
One of Faron’s biggest hits was “Hello Walls.” Written by Willie Nelson, it held the position of #1 for 9 weeks on the Country Charts 50 years ago in 1961. Hits like “You Ain’t lovin’ You Ain’t Living,” and “Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young,” made him a honky tonk singer.
Faron Young was one of country music’s most colorful stars. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana in February 1932. He was discovered by Webb Pierce in 1951. He was known as “The Hillbilly Heartthrob” and was a staple at the Grand Ole Opry and various radio and television shows.
During the 90′,s Young was stricken with emphysema. He became depressed by his poor health. He shot himself in December 1996 at age 64.
Sunday October 9th we will remember Faron Young, his life and music on the Country Classic Show at 11 a.m. on the Country Classic Spotlight.</span></div></div>

Living in his own little fantasy world, he has let his naive fascination with Ayn Rand and his loose grasp on reality convince himself that he could start the country from scratch and make it work. Thus, we learned today of Glenn Beck's plan for Independence, America. Announced on his show and reported on by Mike Krumboltz of Yahoo News, "Beck-town USA" will be a self-sustaining community of real Americans, and I can only assume it will be located somewhere between Brigadoon and Shangri-La. This paradise will allow all the John Galts of America to escape the progressive hell they currently occupy, and it will also free them from the horrors of consumer culture. Apparently, Glenn Beck has some contempt for successful American corporations like The Gap and Ann Taylor, as he plans to ban them from his Eden, saying "if you want the Gap or Ann Taylor, go someplace else."
Beck-ville is supposed to be self-sustaining - like the hippie communes of the 1960s - for it will also feature a ranch where people will "grow food" and "teach others" how to grow food. Hmmm. Sounds like Glenn Beck is going a little Mao Ze Dong on the country. Perhaps all Beck-ville-ites will smelt their own iron and sew their own cotton into their own clothes as well. These happy little "nationalists (?)" will be entertained, of course, by shows featuring Glenn Beck running the Beck media center. I'd imagine that HBO and ESPN and Hollywood films will be unavailable because they are all products of the commie elite in this country. Sounds like a great little paradise that Beck has plans for. Where it will be, I'm not sure. However, I'd bet the states of Mississippi or Alabama would love to be freed from the chains of all the federal aid they currently receive. Or perhaps Beck could just convince the state of Texas to secede with him.
This isn't the first time that Glenn Beck has revealed a colossal misunderstanding of history and economics. Last time, he stole from Founding Father Thomas Paine and bastardized the classic tome Common Sense. Of course, I don't think Glenn Beck really has a plan for his utopia. However, he is all but too happy to sell a bunch of Republican conservatism to under-educated or ideologically naive people for a nice little profit.

In the case of "Mr. Christie and his Wandering Aperture", Private Investigator B.J. Fletcher and her best friend George go undercover at Dominic Christie's photography studio. Once there, they set to work to uncover proof on Marilyn's cheating husband. Unfortunately for our intrepid investigator, things don't go quite according to plan.
B.J. Fletcher: Private Eye is a wicked awesome web series centering on the investigatorial shenanigans of Private Investigator B.J. Fletcher and her best friend and assistant, Georgia Drew. In a rollercoaster ride of action, comedy and drama, the series follows our dynamic female duo as they take on everything from running surveillance, to going undercover, to foiling would-be saboteurs, all whilst grappling with their ever-evolving relationship. Will they? Won't they? The chemistry between the two characters is undeniable and presents an intriguing and complex relationship as it unfolds over the course of the series.</span></div></div>

Working on some new printing plates for clay impressions.

Katherine and I are very excited to see how our new range will be perceived. We are still in the initial stages at the moment but I can sense it will be great!

She had so much fun making faces.
After A went to bed, Cayden got some mommy snuggles. I love this baby boy.
Last Monday night Adalyn was sitting on the counter making dinner with me as she does most nights. I took the skillet off of the flat top burner and turned my head for one second and she put her hand on the burner. It was horrible. I've never seen her in such pain. Her cry was horrible and I felt horrible. I called the Dr after hours and she didn't feel that we needed to go to the ER. We finally got A calmed down and she ate a little dinner. We had mini cupcakes in the house so we gave her one after dinner to help her feel better. I think it helped. What do you think?
She decided eating her cupcake with no hands was better than eating it with one hand. (She did the same thing for her birthday cupcake.) Funny girl.
She has big blisters the length of each finger still. Poor thing. She's so not a complainer tho. We went to the Dr the next day and she gave us a rx for burn cream and A lets us put it on her and has been good about keeping a sock over her hand to protect it.
Sweet babies. I love these two and how much they love each other.
On Sunday Adalyn went and found her sunglasses in the junk drawer and put them on her head to wear them around. I guess she's seen mommy do that. Jonathan and I couldn't believe how old she looked. Even her little pose in this picture... She's growing up!
I always give Adalyn a "pony" on the top of her head. But I had never tried to give her a real pony tail with all of her hair. I put this in on Sunday and she loved it and showed me her pony and then would point to mine. This didn't help with how old she was looking that day!!
We've had a bit of TV drama. VERY long story short, our old TV was an extremely good TV that we got an amazing deal on 3 years ago. For a few months it's been acting weird to the point that we have to unplug and replug it to get it to work. We had purchased the extended protection plan at Best Buy (usually a waste of money but we got our monies worth out of it!) and had it serviced 4 times without any good results so Best Buy put us in for a replacement. We took both kids to run into the store to pick out our new TV. It turned into multiple hours in the store. They delivered the TV the next weekend and from the moment it was on the wall we both absolutely hated it. I know it's petty because it was a 52 inch flat screen TV. We shouldn't complain about teeny tiny things like how crisp the picture, color and sound were, but we felt like we had given up our amazing old tv that we still loved for a piece of crap. We went back and did an exchange and waited till the next weekend for our new TV to be delivered yet again. We went back to our original brand (Samsung) and from the moment we plugged it in we loved it. We were back to the original quality of our old TV. (Guess that wasn't really a "long story short"...more like a "long story".) Adalyn was quite enthralled with the different TV's going on and off the wall and the Best Buy guys delivering the new TVs. She even tried to help her daddy hang the new TV so I had to get pictures.
She was serious about it.
My sweet smiley boy. He is an absolute joy. I love him so much! He has found his voice and his tongue. He's constantly talking and squawking and blowing raspberries now. I think he's trying to compete with his sister because he is LOUD! :)

That pony tail is too cute and she does look grown up! I want our babies back! Hope A's hand heals soon! Yay for a new TV!
Pictures are the best and that's really all that matters. I remember not having much time at all, but I do have a ton of pictures to look back on! :) I hope her burn is better.. that is so scary! K got burned on her bottom really, really bad when she was little all from going down a hot slide in her bathing suit. So just an FYI, always check slides in the summertime. I know after that everyone I know does, including K.
Ack! I can't believe my baby girl is getting so old!
The picture of her with her pony tail reminds me so much of Kennedy. Where did our baby girl go?
Ok. I totally get the tv scenario.. my hubs feels the same way about picture quality, etc. So much so that it takes us months to decide on one!
What is that double Sophie thing C is holding? Very interesting! He is flipping adorable and growing too fast.
A is precious in her glasses and pony! Poor baby with that hand!
Yay...I always love seeing your blog pop up on the reader! :)
Thanks for the update. Glad all is going well. Poor A with her hand! I can't imagine the pain {both of you!} where in! :(
I'm in lov with Adalyn's pony...precious! Her poor little hand - I imagine that was quite traumatic. Hope she is feeling much better! I love, love all the little faces - those will be so much fun to look at years from now. C is getting so big. I can't believe our babies are going to be 1/2 year old soon - how did that happen?</span></div></div>

Several top U.S. officials said the video -- which reportedly contains the moment the al Qaeda leader was killed -- would not be made public, but a new report is calling into question whether the footage exists at all.
The report, slated for publication this week by The New Yorker, says that no helmet-cams were involved in the operation. The New Yorker's report offers a detailed account of the raid, but admits that parts may be "imprecise" since it can only be recreated based on recollection.
CBS News first reported the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras, and top U.S. officials confirmed to several news organizations, including ABC News, at the time that some of the SEALs had worn them. That information was based on initial reports received by officials in Washington, D.C.
The New Yorker article does not cite any specific sources for its information on the helmet-cams, but bases other account details on U.S. officials involved in the operation.
Spokesmen for the Department of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment for this report about the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras.
"We have not released any information on that operation, nor will we," U.S. SOCOM public affairs officer Ken McGraw told ABC News.
When a tense President Obama and national security team watched the operation unraveling from the White House's Situation Room -- a moment now immortalized in an iconic photograph -- it was reported they were not watching live feeds from any helmet-cams, but instead a feed from a drone buzzing thousands of feet above the SEALs' heads.</span></div></div>

No, I'm not kidding. But he was a sweetheart and as long as you could keep him on track he made a lot of good contributions to the class ---- well, he was taking a pottery class along with mine and he made me a mug!
See? It is currently decorating my office, but I don't trust his glazing skills enough to actually use it. That's ok; it's pretty. And it makes me want to take cool pottery classes every time I look at it.
This semester I have a different little sweetheart, who is out and proud and not only willing to step up and testify on that front but also bring up issues of race and social justice in the class, which is awesome. And he catches whatever little risque jokes or off-color puns I accidentally make but I don't feel like I'm about to get into trouble.
A while back he asked me some questions after class --- those questions that don't really seem to have a point except for the subtext of "I like you!" --- And I have been there with that awkward I-don't-know-what-to-say-to-a-favorite-teacher-but-I-don't-want-the-class-to-be-over situation and totally love that.
So the next day he dropped by my office hours with a big plastic shopping bag. "Dr. Cog, I just wanted to give this to you!" Awwwwww. So I opened it up, and found ...
Hmm. On the one hand, I totally appreciate this. And I drank them, so it's not like I am worried he was poisoning me or anything. Every day I'd open one and go "sweet! I don't have to spend any money on my caffeine habit!" But I also, because I have to overthink everything, wonder if this is making some sort of comment on me, or on my caffeine habit or weight or something.
But no! Stop this! Just drink your damn gifts and revel in the fact that you were offered them. If they start offering me whiskey to mix with it, that's when I know I have a problem.

One former student gave me a big jug of homemade maple syrup. :) (Her family makes maple syrup, along with growing farm stuff.) WAY COOL! And soooo yummy!
I'm still waiting for the Porsche and the diamonds. /nod
This is all so so sweet.
Well, except for the anaphylactic death part.
Oh, just enjoy the goodies. My first - and certainly most memorable - was a bag of comfort food: mac &amp; cheese, diet coke, cookies, candy bars - from a student in one of my very first classes. She brought it by when she found out I was prepping for my MA exams, along with best wishes from all the friends she'd met in that class.
I've had the occasional student give me perfume or scented lotions, which have a less-dramatic version of the effect of coconut on you (headache, not anaphylactic shock), but nothing more interesting than that. I sort of like the idea that he actually observed your habits and came up with something that fit them (well, at least until he shows up on your doorstep at midnight one night, but that doesn't seem likely).</span></div></div>

It's time for Accompl.sh to move on to the great big server in the sky. As of March 4, 2013, Accompl.sh is officially closed.
The decision wasn't easy - I spent many hours debating over whether it would be better to just let the site linger with no updates, but in the end I've decided that the best route forward is to shut it down. It would be unfair to promise a great experience to you and not actually provide one. I tried to keep the service running as smoothly as possible even in my absense, but without the proper attention and updates, it became clear that the community was suffering.
I'm still exploring options for Accompl.sh's future - finding the right home for it, perhaps as an open-sourced project or maybe there's someone out there who wants to take it over and bring it to its full potential. Meanwhile, Accompl.sh will be taking a much-deserved nap.
Your goals are yours. If you'd like a copy of your goals they will be available for 30 days. Please email jenn@accompl.sh from the email associated with your account to request your list. After those 30 days, if Accompl.sh hasn't found a new home, all data will be deleted and irretrievable.
There's more info on the blog. If you know of anyone interested in taking over the development of the site or have any other suggestions for its future, please get in touch.
I hope you've enjoyed these last few years of Accompl.sh as much as I have! Just because the site is gone doesn't mean you can't continue to achieve your dreams!
Until next time,
Jenn</span></div></div>

With a special (and hilarious) guest appearance by White Collar’s Willie Garson, their latest short, awesomely entitled FOPS, represents the best three and a half minutes this gang of hooligans has come up with yet – just in time for Bastille Day this weekend. Keep reading if you like delicious cakes …
FOPS is obviously a sendup of COPS. Only this time the chase involves a couple of gungho peasants (Matt Hobby and Philip Quinaz) hunting down decadent cake and candy inhaling richies armed with nothing but some of that homemade piss and vinegar spray everybody was carrying around back in the days of the French Revolution. There’s even a snitching hillbilly fop (Brian Shoaf) who gladly gives up the head cake-eater (Garson) hiding out in the woodlands .
WATCH FOPS below and take a gander at Garson’s scene-stealing turn as the strung out King getting caught with icing on his lip.
The PERIODS. crew has been doing it and doing it well for a while now, starting with the almost instantly viral PILGRIMS. The series is co-created by Quinaz’s wife Anna Martemucci and usually stars his brother Philip Quinaz, both from whom a large portion of the hilarity originates. Featured in the The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Film Independent, and on Funny or Die, they have quickly become known for taking on serious subjects such as the rich and their problem with cake abuse, Ponce de Leon, pillaging and raping, religion and lesbians, and the classic film Deer Hunter (we feel that NAM is the golden sleeper egg of the entire series). Shot in the style of a reality show with a historical twist, this is done with the kind of deceptively intelligent, slow burning improvised humor that will still resonate a week later when you remember the image of Philip Quinaz stroking his own nipples in the midst of foliage.
If you don’t believe us check out Adam’s (of Adam and Eve) apple ball-gag in RE: CREATION. (The wigs in that are amazing, by the way.) While you’re doing that see what his homey God has to say about … whatever.
Always these shorts are released with some timely relevance. Like with FOPS and Bastille Day. While we’re pretty sure only the French care about this upcoming day (or even know what it is, really) we still have to give the PERIODS. crew props for their ingenious ploy for attention.
Actor Zachary Quinto might have something to do with all the buzz as well. His name is attached to the series as occasional co-star and regular producer with his company Before The Door Pictures in association with Robinson Film, Inc., and Nomadic Films.
There are big things on the horizons for these guys, including a feature film produced by Anonymous Content and Before The Door Pictures that is due out sometime this fall. Quinto will also be in attendance to introduce the PERIODS. short series with Quinaz and Martemucci at the Hollyshorts Film Festival on August 9th.
In the meantime, ‘God’ commands you to go watch all the shorts and subscribe to the PERIODS. Films channel on Youtube for more tomfoolery involving fabulous wigs and costumes with just a skotch of controversy thrown in. All the jokes about a woman’s time of the month aside, we dig the pantaloons out of it. Period.</span></div></div>

Maybe, Heirloom Tomato Modern? Of the now five entries in this occasional editorial feature, three are for tomato soup. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps in the past tomato soups were more flexible, more interesting, more varied. Or, maybe I just really like tomato soup!
heirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque
What was the occasion that called for yet another tomato soup? I had just pulled “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen” from the oven, and while it was cooling I realised I needed a simple foil for this “best thing.”
I didn’t feel like running to the market, my brain felt wibbly from hunger and exertion, I wanted something quick and easy. I poked my head in the fridge. Aha! A carton of Pomis! I poked my nose in The Best Of Shaker Cooking. Aha! A simple tomato bisque! (The Shakers are so reliable for simple, quick recipes). Et voila! Dinner was decided.
There are three recipes for tomato soup in this amazing book, but this one from Frances Hall intrigued me with its inclusion of baking soda.
Although she is not noted as being a member of the faithful at Hancock Village, this reference leads me to believe that Frances Hall was actually the last eldress of this beautiful village that is now a working museum (and definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area, A. because it didn’t bore me as a 7th grader on a field trip and B. There’s an amazing restaurant there).
And what of the baking soda? As near as I can figure it added a delicate lightness to this soup which would be very, very necessary if you followed the original recipe which calls for 1 quart of milk (most likely whole and with cream back then) and 1/2 cup of heavy cream! I did not follow those measurements and, after tasting the soup sans dairy and realising it tasted just like Campbell’s, embarked on some very necessary modernising.
I cut down on the dairy, added some garlic and tossed in some slightly spicy, seductively smoky Spanish pimenton de la vera. The pepper added such a lovely, almost bacon-y flavor. Utterly delicious!
And what is “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen?” You’ll just have to stay tuned til tomorrow (or snoop around on my flickr page, should be pretty obvious from there).
Head below the jump for my adaptation of Eldress Hall’s Tomato Bisque.
heirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque
prep time: 5 minutes ~ cooking time: 20 minutes
- 1 tsp Butter
- 1 tsp Flour
- 3 cups Tomato Puree
- heaping 1/4 tsp Baking Soda (the recipe called for 1/3 tsp, but I don’t have one of those, so I just used a heaping 1/4 tsp)
- 2 tsps Salt
- 1 tsp Sugar
- Lemon Juice
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp (or to taste) Pimenton de la Vera
- 2 cups Milk
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low to medium heat. Add the flour and cook gently for 2 minutes or until the flour is cooked.
Add the tomato puree. Stir to incorporate.
Add the salt, sugar and baking soda. Stir to incorporate.
Simmer 5 minutes.
Taste. Adjust seasoning. Add a dash of lemon juice if the soup is too sweet.
Add the minced garlic and Pimenton. Stir to incorporate. Allow the soup to cook another 10 minutes.
In another small pan heat the milk. Do not allow it to boil. When the milk is just warm add it to the tomato mixture, stir to incorporate and serve immediately, piping hot, preferably with some freshly made buttered bread.
And don’t forget to Shaker your plate! (Not that I have any fear you won’t!)
I´m just about to make some tomato soup. Different version, but I´ll use your tip about the milk. Thanks.
great recipe! I’ve been looking for a simple tomato soup that’s a bit interesting and this appears to be both those things. Many thanks!
I love the way this soup looks–the beautiful red color has my mouth watering.
I’ll bet this would be good made with goats’ milk!
I’m guessing the baking soda is added to balance the pH and keep the milk from curdling. I have a yummy tomato soup recipe of my mom’s that includes it as well.
Any chance I could see the original recipe as it was?
Riatta — You can buy the book here for as little as $1 here, or you can check it out from your local library. I am not comfortable publishing other people’s copyrighted material on my site.
Thanks Ann for the link. I’ve ordered the book. Can’t wait to see how you tweaked the recipe. I’m always a little afraid to eperiment.
Oh good Riatta! I hope you love it. There’s so many great recipes in there.</span></div></div>

I’m working on a research project again this year exploring the scholarly habits of undergraduate students at my university. One of the methods we’re using to collect data is a mapping diary. We ask students to record all of their movements through the course of one typical school day–time, location and activity–and draw a map to accompany their time logs. Last year’s responses from students at my own campus were fascinating, and I’m looking forward to interviewing this semester’s students when they finish their logs.
Many of last year’s participants told me that they really enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on what they do and where they go all day. Now that the semester is firmly underway and things are busy as usual, I wonder whether it might be a good idea to do some research on myself. I’ve often wanted to join the Library Day in the Life project in the past, but it always seems to be scheduled for days that I’m either out on vacation or before the semester has begun (that is, not really a typical day for me). Maybe it’s time for me to pick a day (or week, or month) to record my activities?
It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that there’s not enough time for everything I want to do. Of course that’s true on one level, because no one can do everything, but I also think that we may be less busy than we realize. A post on Prof Hacker over the summer popped into my mind when I was considering this, a review of a book called 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think (168 is the number of hours in a week). The review isn’t completely positive, but does highlight the use of time logging to inject a dose of reality into how we perceive that we spend our time.
Judging from my interviews with students last year, this kind of reflection can help with both time management and task prioritization. Though it sounds like more work to add a time log to my to-do list here in the thick of the semester, I think it’s worth a try. And maybe the next time the Library Day in the Life date rolls around I’ll be ready to participate, too.

About 100 people attended, who lived in at least 10 countries, including Japan, India, Myanmar, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US. Ages ranged from 18 years old to over 50. Their open tech/culture fields included Python workshops, soft circuits, fan fiction, Linux, open geographical information, open data, open courseware, and Wikipedia and related projects. Attendees were volunteers, professionals, students, hobbyists, and academics, and came from the government, large corporations, non-profits, volunteer communities, small businesses, and educational institutions. We’re very pleased with the diversity of our attendees.
We ran over 65 sessions over 2 days. Session topics included Hands on Hacking, Geek Moms, Women Editing Wikipedia, Burnout and Lifehacking, Fandom, Feminism &amp; Social Change, Soft Circuits, Job Seeker/We’re Hiring!, and Feminist Hackathons, to name just a few. In total, over 40 of the sessions were documented on PiratePad.
The Impostor Syndrome session was so popular that it ran in at least three separate sessions. One attendee said, .”
One of the most popular sessions was the Python Beginners Workshop in which several attendees learned to program for the first time. “It is hard to do workshops at un-conferences, but you can’t put a price on getting someone in front of a terminal and writing a new line of code. It’s empowering to enable the success of another human being,” said Connie Berardi. Leslie Birch said, “I’m leaving with new tools like IRC, bug trackers and mentor lists. I have a new found desire to reach out to other women that identify as ‘geek’, ‘feminist’ or both.”
One popular feature of AdaCamp was the “Wall of Compliments.” The idea is to combat Impostor’s Syndrome and increase everyone’s enjoyment of the conference by writing compliments on sticky notes and adding them to a wall. Other attendees “take a compliment” and either keep them or give them to other people to wear on their badges.
Finally, AdaCamp DC got a lot of compliments on the conference food. Rebecca Garcia tweets, “#AdaCampDC You are spoiling us! First Ethiopian food now Lebanese food? :) Best conference food ever.” Sisi Wei writes, “Ethiopian food for lunch? #adacampdc and @adainitiative are putting other conferences’s cuisines to shame.” Remember, bad conference food is a choice, not a requirement!
Thank you to everyone who helped make AdaCamp DC a success, starting with our conference organizers, Caroline Simard, Deb Nicholson, Kellie Brownell, NoÃrÃn Shirley, Sarah Stierch, Katie Bechtold, and Denise Paolucci. Thanks especially to Sarah Stierch for organizing the conference dinners, writing a dining guide for DC, helping arrange photography, and spreading the word about AdaCamp DC and the various travel scholarships available to AdaCamp DC attendees. Selena Deckelmann also helped arrange photography, organized the sessions, and gave the organizers general assistance. Gayle Karen Young graciously offered to facilitate our feedback sessions and offered various organizational resources. Katie Bechtold was our eyes and hands on the ground in Washington, DC. We thank all of our day-of volunteers who ran registration and helped with setup and cleanup. Finally, we thank everyone who attended.</span></div></div>

back to New Zealand, New Zealand
... 'Janeway to Auckland Control, roger. Landing approach at one-three-one-mark seven.'
'Roger, Janeway,' the bright New Zealand voice on the other end of the channel replied. 'Enjoy your stay.'
She set about the business of guiding her slim shuttle past the island's rugged mountains without dignifying the Kiwi's sarcasm with a reply. " [More in New Zealand, pg. 17-29, 35, 61, 66, 228.]
'Don't tell me you've actually read Nietzsche and Derrida. Or Aquinas, for that matter.'
'You don't have to eat the entire turd to know that it's not a crab cake.'
'You are an arrogant impossible boy.' "
'The Superman shouldn't care what the ondergeskik thinks of him, you mean? 'I teach you the Superman.' ' He shook his head and fell silent for several moments.
'Maybe,' he said at last, 'in terms of education, physical training, wealth, eugenics, perhaps soon even genetics--maybe by some standards we Draka have become Nietzsche's superman. We certainly like to flatter ourselves into thinking we have.'
He shook his head. 'But one would think that a superman shouldn't have to fear. And we do. We fear everybody else on the planet.'
'With good reason,' the Archon said. 'Everybody else on the planet fears us. Hates us, too...' "
Admiral Hans Laban Verwoerd lay sprawled in the center of Cornet castle's ancient courtyard. A heavy boot ground itself into his spine, pinning him to the rough stone flagging.
Banners, printed with motivational slogans, hung limp in the dawn air. Verwoerd turned his head, scraping his cheek against the rough flagstones. I want gremlins around me, the nearest one read, for I am courageous. " [This quote is from Nietzsche. There are many quotes from and references to Nietzsche throughout story. It is the main religion/philosophy referred to in the story. Not all refs. in DB.]
' 'What is the best remedy? Victory!' Or 'I want gremlins around me, for I am courageous'?'
'Yes. What ever does that one mean?'
'What do Nietzsche's syphilitic rambling ever mean? 'Courage creates gremlins for itself' is the rest of that particular quotation.' He washed out his brush and dabbed a new color. 'Just be glad I'm not hanging those banners all over town the way Security wants me to. They're supposed to remind my troops they're Draka supermen.' He made a face.
'Are they? They don't act like it.' "
He daubed his brush in a mixture of colors. 'There was a time in my life when I thought of little else but Nietzsche. I was a young man at the time; I'd spent my life in British boarding schools, thought of myself as British, but I was still Draka. I guess I was trying to discover who I was.'
Sally rolled her head around, stretching her neck muscles. She resumed her pose. 'He's almost your state religion, isn't he?'
Verwoerd snorted. 'The Draka worship nothing but themselves. 'Serfs look up because they wish to be exalted; the superman looks down because he already is exalted.' when you're the oppermans, it's rather had to admit some entity might be superior to yourself. That's why the attempt to revive the Norse mythology, Naldorssen and all that, failed so miserably. Probably also why religion has always fascinated me so.' "
Verwoerd smiled weakly. 'Since when did you start reading Nietzsche?' he asked.
'Since you started hanging it up in the courtyards.' " [Other refs. not in DB include pg. 208-209, 218-221.]
...Verwoerd's voice was barely audible. Courage did create its own gremlins: the courage to hope. ";
Pg. 214: "'Pity's the greatest danger, Hans. That's what Neechee says, an' it's true. Dangerous for them. Dangerous for us.' "
'There's no way you can escape, Hans. The courtyard is swarming with commandos.'
'Nietzsche was right all along,' Verwoerd said as if he hadn't heard her. 'Right about so many things. 'Once I thought of little else but Nietzsche'--would that I had ever been able to stop!
'Those three days I stared into the abyss--'thou heaven above me, thou pure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of light!--and it stared back at me.'
...' 'And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and whatever tainteth thee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, because it tainted thee!' ' " [More.]
'Then I visited that accursed city [Salt Lake City], saw that same Will channeled into their [Mormons] morality, their serf dreams. To 'never never never' fall under the yoke, to be gods looking down in pity on mere superman. To will the absurd fantasies of religion into reality--entire nations that don't have to conquer or murder or . . .'
He composed himself. 'I knew then my people [Draka] were too evil to let them continue to exist. I dedicated my life to destroying the Domination.' "
'You admire Neitzsche?'
'He was crazy. Let's just say I have less contempt for him, and for Desade, then I have for most intellectuals.' " [See also pg. 239.]

The exhibit officially opens on Wednesday with an evening gathering open to all current members of Historic Saranac Lake.
Six large panels in the John Black Room outline the development of the village, from its early days as a small logging town to its growth as a destination for outdoor recreation and a center for scientific research and patient care. The final panel explores the village's effort to find new life after the decline of the tuberculosis industry. Interspersed among the exhibit panels are historic photos on loan from the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library.

"Hundreds of visitors come here each year eager to learn more about the community," Historic Saranac Lake Executive Director Amy Catania said in a press release. "This new exhibit will orient visitors to our fascinating history and help them understand who we are today. They are beautiful panels that really bring to life our local history."
Historic Saranac Lake plans to supplement the new panels with more artifacts and interpretation. The organization is raising funds to allow for the installation of case lighting and an expansion of this first phase of the exhibit.
Five of the panels feature large historic photographs courtesy of the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library. The final panel features a present day photo provided by Saranac Lake photographer Mark Kurtz.
The planning and design of the exhibit was supported by a Museumwise Get Set grant and by grants from the New York Council for the Humanities. The exhibit script was written by Field Horne in consultation with local history experts and Christopher Clarke. Kevan Moss Design led the planning effort and the design of the John Black Room panels. The fabrication of the exhibit panels was supported by a donation from a friend of Historic Saranac Lake, Henry Parnass.
The main laboratory space also features new interpretation for the summer season. Designer Karen Davidson created an exhibit panel interpreting the architecture of the Trudeau Sanatorium and another panel showing the human lungs that once lined the basement shelves. Visitors can tour a new "cure room" displaying artifacts such as a cure chair, medicines and medical devices that were a part of the patient experience.
Founded in 1980, Historic Saranac Lake is an architectural preservation organization that captures and presents local history from its center at the Saranac Laboratory Museum.
The museum is open year-round, Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and also on Saturdays through Oct. 6. Admission is $5, and members and children are free.

Lauren designed this sparse site with tons of room for Re Jin's breathtaking photos. She even has videos of her products - talk about thorough!
I wish I'd done it sooner!
"It was an absolute pleasure working with Aeolidia.
From design to programming, they nailed every single item on my 'must have' list - all within schedule. That's pretty impressive!
Aeolidia's project management system was extraordinary. It was very easy to keep track of my tasks and deadlines. Detailed tutorials were provided and if I had any doubts, they were cleared quickly. Most importantly, I felt that the team was always 'there' for me.
I am very happy to have worked with Aeolidia and wish I'd done it sooner!
Thank you for making this an enjoyable experience. I love the new website!"

The NFL Draft is less than a week away and similarly the world’s finest delicacies, all of the prospects have been picked, prodded, interviewed, and overanalyzed as much as possible (yes, people talk to their food). But this draft presents can prove to be an opportunistic time for our Jaguars.
Since the season ended we have heard all-knowing know-nothings say that the team will pick Justin Blackmon, Melvin Ingram, Quinton Coples or Michael Floyd. I however agree with those that feel the Jaguars will trade back and acquire more draft picks.
As of right now the team does need to upgrade the defensive line and the wide receiver corps. Honestly, I have not been blown away by any particular wide receiver in this draft and think that equal value for that position (should the Jaguars choose to pull the trigger on a receiver) can be found later in the first round. That was my suggestion of Jacksonville thinking about Reuben Randle or Stephen Hill.
So what would make me happy this draft? Us finding and coaxing this year’s version of the Atlanta Falcons to give up numerous picks for our seventh. It might not be as much as the Falcons relinquish last year to get Julio Jones, unless Tannehill is still available, but a nice version of a First Coast Stimulus Package would be quite nice. No, I’m not a politician by any stretch of the word.
But, these are my thoughts. And whether we agree to disagree on the issue or are on the same page, it is certain that a few new rookies will be coming to an NFL franchise near you.
Oh, and let’s try to allow the rookies to get their team gear and lockers before we rip to shreds this season. Much obliged readers, much obliged.</span></div></div>

Don’t think about it, just do it
That’s what my grandmother always says. Whenever I have a problem, a challenge or am faced with anything in life, my grandmother has the same advice every single time.
“Don’t think about it,” she says, with the wave of a hand. “Just do it.”
I know it sounds … like a sneaker ad… But it’s really good advice and it seems to crop up when I least expect it.
But her voice crept into my head not long ago when management let the residents of my apartment complex know that they would be conducting their annual inspections recently. It’s funny how content one can be being incredibly messy – until one is going to have people in her dwelling space.
My spare room was, at one time, used for guests. But over time, as my schedule got busier and guests became more sporadic it went from spare room to catchall. There are extra lamps, a television, my desk (which sadly does not get used enough), a guest bed, boxes (and boxes) of notebooks and … well you get the idea.
Some people like to make an organized plan of cleaning. In some cases, that’s my plan of action. While I have a particular method to cleaning the kitchen, it’s a completely different story when it comes to the rest of the house.
Don’t think about it, just do it…
Even with a weekend chock full of things to do, physical fitness training, wrapping up work items that didn’t get done from the week, writing articles for other outlets that need to be finished by their deadline, I dropped everything suddenly and cleaned out that room.
And it wasn’t just a surprise – it was a relief. Until the other day, I never opened the door to that room to hide the mess. Now, I don’t mind going in there.
I might even clean my bedroom.
I said ‘might.’
Cleaning for Travel
I travel quite a bit for work. Not too much, but just enough that returning to my own apartment can sometimes be the sweetest feeling in the world. Or, depending on its cleanliness, make me yearn to be back on the road, in the comforts of a generic hotel room, orderly and sterile-ish.
Last week I spent several days in Las Vegas for a convention at the Venetian. I left on a Sunday and spent the entire morning packing and picking up around my apartment. My place looked presentable…but for some reason that wasn’t good enough. I think deep down I knew I couldn’t spend a week in Vegas – of all places – and come home to an apartment that was unclean.
I decided to finally get to all the hard-to-reach places and pain-in-the-neck tasks that are so often neglected. I broke out the Cooktop cleaner. Scrubbed the bathroom. Even cleaned out the refrigerator. It was possibly the most productive few hours I’ve ever spent during a weekend.
So when I left the apartment and headed to the airport, I felt good. A little grossed out by the scrubbing and some things I found in my fridge, but overall pretty good.
But the big payoff was yet to come…
When I arrived home after several days in Sin City and a full day of traveling back from Pacific Time, I was so relieved to have an apartment worth coming home to. It was clean, it smelled halfway decent, and I was proud of the work I’d put in before my trip. It made it all worthwhile.
Early Spring Cleaning
Of the 115 Groundhog Days on record since it began in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has only predicted an early spring 16 times. Fortunately, this year we’re lucky the groundhog did not see his shadow, so 2013 is off to a great start!
Based on my calculations, what with the vernal equinox falling on March 20 and Phil’s gift of six weeks less of winter, that means Spring should be happening….now?
This is actually fantastic news. Not only because flip flops are my favorite and I will wear them as soon as my toes can tolerate the weather, but because my apartment needs a spring clean like it’s nobody’s business.
More often as of late, when I have people over, I feel like I’m showcasing the “fake apartment.” You know, the one that is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but heaven forbid someone opens the wrong door and ski equipment tumbles out of it (but you don’t even ski). This needs to end! And I know exactly how to put a stop to it.
One thing that I really need to procure is a dresser for my clothes. I don’t know how it happened, but my bedroom floor is now an extension of my closet. It’s relatively organized, but there are piles everywhere. I’ve been putting it off, but I know I need to buckle down, pick one that I like and get organized!
Dusting is also a major issue. I’m allergic to dust, so you’d think I’d have this under control, but apparently I’m a glutton for punishment. It just isn’t something that crosses my mind, coupled with the fact that I have yet to find a duster/product that I like. But I know dusting really does make a huge difference in the appearance of all surfaces so this is definitely another thing I need to tackle.
Lastly, the kitchen is always a big one. Getting grime out of those harder to reach corners and concentrating on spots that are often overlooked (I completely ignore that area underneath my dish drying rack) will definitely be a focus. I also need to actually clean the sink, not just the dirty plates in it, and give my stove a good scrub as well.
There’s definitely a lot to be done, but it’s totally manageable! And thanks to this year’s early spring, I’m going to get a head start on turning my “fake apartment” into a clean one.
Work it Out, Clean it Up
If you’re anything like me, you probably don’t have a ton of spare time. Between work, family, social obligations, time just flies by and I hardly have a minute to myself. So what happens when your days seem to shorten and a few free minutes are tough to find? Things get prioritized, other thing get cut out entirely.
Unfortunately for me, what ends up on the cutting room floor is usually the gym and cleaning my apartment. These routine-driven activities are just too easy to push to the side and marginalize when faced with deadlines, commitments, and other responsibilities. It’s a shame too – both activities leave you feeling refreshed and feeling better about yourself. These endeavors can put you in a better place than you were when you started, and that’s pretty hard to replace.
So what I do is try to combine the two. I know that sounds silly but hear me out a second. When you carve out the time to clean your apt, throw some reps in there too! For example, for every dish you scrub and dry by hand, drop and do five pushups. Vacuum for 30-seconds then do 30-seconds of jumping jacks. How about throwing in a few lunges when taking the trash out?
Will you look like a crazy person? Maybe, but that’s for your neighbors to decide. Point is, cleaning and exercise are two aspects of your life that shouldn’t be compromised. In this month when so many New Year’s Resolutions have died or on their last legs, recommit yourself to finding the time. Ok, so maybe reaching the highest shelf to dust isn’t part of a typical yoga vinyasa, but you can get creative.
And don’t worry about the neighbors; they’ll go from asking “what is she doing?” to “how does she do it?”

And it comes with David Card’s name right on the title page; this is certainly not a name that one associates with structural modeling!
Field experiments and randomized control trials are booming at the moment. Until the past decade, an average year saw a single field experiment published in any of the top five journals. Now, 8 to 10 a year are. The vast majority of these papers are atheoretical, though I have a small complaint about the definition of “theoretical” which I’ll leave for the final paragraph of this post. The same atheoretical nature is largely true of lab experiments; I generally am very receptive to field experiments and much less so to lab experiments, so I’ll leave out discussion of the lab for now.
(That said, I’m curious for the lab types out there: are there any good examples of lab experiments which have overturned a key economic insight? By overturned, I mean the reversal was accepted as valid by many economists. I don’t mean “behavioral theory” like Kahneman-Tversky. I mean, an actual lab experiment in the style of the German School – we ought call it that at this point. It just seems to me like many of the “surprising” results just turn out not to be true once we move to economically relevant behavior in the market. The “gift reciprocity” paper by Fehr and coauthors is a great example, and Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier discuss it. In the lab, people “work” much harder when they get paid a surprisingly high wage. In field and natural experiments trying to replicate this, with Gneezy and List (2006) being the canonical example, there is no such economically relevant effect. I would love some counterexamples of this phenomenon, though: I’m trying my best to keep an open mind!)
But back to field experiments. After noting the paucity of theory in most experimental papers, the authors give three examples of where theory could have played a role. In the gift reciprocity/wages literature mentioned above, there are many potential explanations for what is going on in the lab. Perhaps workers feel inequity aversion, and don’t want to “rip off” unprofitable employers. Perhaps they simple act under reciprocity – if you pay me a high wage, I’ll work hard even in a one-shot game. A properly designed field experiment can distinguish between the two. An even better example is charitable giving. List and Lucking-Reiley ran a famous 2002 field experiment where they examined whether giving to charity could be affected by, for example, claiming in the brochure that the goal of the fundraising drive was already almost reached. But can’t we learn much more about charity? Do people give because of warm glow? Or because of social pressure? Or some other reason? List, Dellavigna and Malmendier have a wonderful 2010 paper that writes down a basic structural model of gift-giving, and introduces just enough randomization into the experimental design to identify all of the parameters. They find that social pressure is important, and that door-to-door fundraising can actually lower total social welfare, even taking into account the gain from purchasing whatever public good charity is raising money for. And their results have a great link back to earlier theory and to future experiments along similar lines. Now that’s great work!
The complaints against structural models always seemed hollow to me. As Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier note, when interpreting results, every paper, structural or not, is making implicit assumptions. Why not make them in a way that is both clear and is guided by the huge body of theoretical knowledge that social science has already developed? The authors note a turn away from structural models in experiments after the negative income tax papers of the 70s and 80s were thought to be failures in some sense due to the difficulty of interpreting their results. This argument was always a bit ridiculous: all social science results are hard to interpret, and there’s no way around this. Writing up research in a way that it seems more clearcut to a policy audience does not mean that the evidence actually is clearcut.
I do have one quibble with this paper, though – and I think the authors will sympathize with this complaint given their case studies. The authors divide experimental papers into four groups: descriptive, single model, competing model and parameter estimation. Single model, to take one example, is defined as a paper that lays out a formal model and tests one or more implications thereof. Similar definitions are given for competing models and parameter estimations. Once we get over Friedman’s 1953 model of economic methodology, though, we’ve got to realize that “testing” models is far, far away from the only link between theory and data. Theory is useful to empirics because it can guide interesting and nonobvious questions to look for, because it can be used to justify nontestable econometric assumptions, because it allows for reasonable discussion of counterfactuals, because it allows empirical studies to be linked into a broader conception of knowledge, because it allows for results to be interpreted correctly, etc. I’d argue that checking whether papers “test” models is almost irrelevant for knowing whether empirical papers properly use theory. Let me give my favorite example, which I used in a presentation to empirical economists last year. Imagine you study government-mandated hospital report cards, and find that two years into the program, there is no evidence that hospitals or patients are changing behavior based on the ratings, but that 20% of patients were looking at the report cards at some point. An atheoretical paper might suggest that these report card programs are a waste of money. A theoretically-guided paper would note that game theorists have shown reputational equilibria often are discontinuous, and that perhaps if more patients were induced to look at the report cards (maybe by directly mailing them to each household once a year), hospitals would begin to react by giving better care. There is no testing of a theoretical model or anything similar, but there is certainly great use of theory! (Perhaps of interest: my two favorite job market papers of the last couple years, those of Ben Handel and Heidi Williams, both use theory in one of the ways above rather than in the direct “let’s use data to test a theoretical model” framework…)
Similar comments apply to theorists’ use of empirical research, of course, but let’s save that for another day. (February 2011 working paper – forthcoming in the JEP)
Hi, I’m a recent PhD graduate from a “behavioral economics” graduate program–just wanted to reply about your quip about lab experiments.
First one funny story—Norbert Schwarz, a fairly famous social psychologist, was giving a talk at Harvard’s experimental/behavioral econ seminar about 2 years ago. He was presenting some findings on accessibility (e.g. that easy to pronounce stock market ticker names did better at IPO—how’s that for market relevance?) and received the standard econ question about incentives and whether that would change his observed lab experiment. Upon which he remarked, “have incentives ever really been shown to truly change a bias once it is demonstrated in the lab? can you take even one important bias and show that it goes away?” Apparently he’s not familiar with John List’s work
I don’t believe anyone in the audience replied–Ed Glaeser didn’t come that day, else I’m sure he would have made a caustic retort.
But to you I would direct a similar critique. There are numerous examples of biases that don’t change in the face of market incentives. Medical decision making is one place where it’s very difficult to square people’s choices with a rational model. I would check out some of Peter Ubel’s work in that vein. But to offer you a better example–how about this QJE paper of Ariely and Loewenstein on Coherent Arbitrariness. You have a lab study that essentially creates a market and shows that anchoring effects are not altered by market exchange. In general many of the canonical biases in Kahneman and Tversky don’t seem to change very much in the face of incentives–Holt and Laury’s paper on risk aversion comes to mind. So I think there are problems on both sides.
(Not to mention the methodological issues with trusting studies in each camp–theres plenty of con in econometrics, and plenty of file drawer and other dirty secrets in social psych– the researcher degrees of freedom problem to me presents the most serious problem in trying to
understand what papers have the most external validity)
Coherent Arbitrariness:
(though here’s one replication failure for more common market goods:
I’ve run anchoring studies and found them to be pretty stable–friends as well)
Risk Aversion:
I’d be curious to know what you think…
Oh yeah, one more obvious example comes to mind…all of Thaler’s stuff on default effects on retirement decisions. People have huge incentives to be rational there, but don’t seem to be…
Thanks for the citations, Paul. I’ll definitely check them out. Concerning Thaler and retirement, though, I suppose I question the extent to which lab studies about anchoring “convinced” the profession rather than simple evidence of the choices people actually make with their retirement accounts. Two followups to that statement: first, I have nothing against “behavioral economics” per se – it’s clearly useful – but I’m less sold on the lab experimental method of behavioral social science. Second, you might wonder why I care about whether A or B is found convincing by the profession. I’ve written a few times here that I subscribe to a philosophy of science that puts a ton of weight on subjective judgment of quality of research by practitioners, so I actually think the question of credit is pretty important here.
I’m with you that there certainly need be more conversations between different methodological schools, however. I’m sure Ed would have been caustic upon hearing Schwarz’ remark, and I recall a lecture here at NW by Ernst Fehr where that eminence grise was nearly driven out the room with pitchforks.</span></div></div>

1) Abstract
This document describes the guidelines for IPv4 address allocation and assignment in the AFRINIC service region (Africa and Part of the Indian Ocean) .They have been developed through an open, bottom up policy development process of AFRINIC's Policy Working Group.
2) Introduction
AFRINIC (The African Network Information Center) is a non-for-profit independent organisation serving as one of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR's). Its service region incorporates the African continent and part of the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros). AFRINIC is responsible for the allocation of IP (Internet Protocol) address space, AS (Autonomous System) Numbers and management of reverse domain names within the region.
3) Scope
This document describes policies for the responsible management of unique IPv4 address space in the AFRINIC region. The policies in this document apply to all IPv4 allocations and assignments within the AFRINIC service region and must be implemented by all AFRINIC's Local Internet Registries.
This document does not describe policies related to IPv6, AS numbers, private addresses and in-addr.arpa domains. These policies can be found at
It does not describe conditions of AFRINIC membership decribed at nor does it examine the policies of the other Regional Internet Registries.
4) IPv4 address space
For the purpose of this document, IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary numbers (used as identifiers in the IPv4 protocol) and are usually in three types:
a. Public/global IP addresses that are assigned to be globally unique according to the goals described in section 6 of this document..
c. IP ranges reserved for experiments: These are described in RFC3330 (). Some ranges are also reserved for multicast.
5) Hierarchy of address space distribution
IP addresses are distributed in an hierarchical structure in which IANA (The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates address space to AFRINIC, to be redistributed throughout the African region. AFRINIC allocates address space to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and also delegates to them the authority to make assignments and sub-allocations. LIRs sub-allocate and assign address space to their customers in accordance with the policies and procedures described in this document.
6) Definitions
The following terms and their definitions are of particular importance to the understanding of the goals, environment, and policies described in this document.
6.1 Internet Registry (IR)
An Internet Registry (IR) is an organization that is responsible for distributing IP address space to its customers and for registering those addresses. IRs are classified according to their primary function and territorial scope within the hierarchical structure.
6 four RIRs: APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC. AFRINIC is the fifth
6.
6.4 Allocation
To "allocate" means to distribute address space to LIRs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.
6.5 Sub-Allocation
To "sub-allocate" means to distribute address space (by LIRs) to ISPs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.
6.
6.
6.
7) Goals of the Internet Registry System
7.1 Goals
It is AFRINIC's primary duty, as a custodian of a public resource, to ensure that for all Ipv4 allocations and assignments, the following goals are met:
- Uniqueness - In order that each host on the public internet can be uniquely identified, each public unicast IPv4 address must be globally unique.
- Registration - Every assignment and allocation of public Internet address space must be registered in the AFRINIC whois database. This is necessary to ensure uniqueness and to provide information for Internet trouble shooting at all levels.
- Aggregation - Distributing Ipv4 addresses in a hierachical manner permits the aggregation of routing information. This helps to ensure proper operation of internet routing, and to limit the expansion of Internet routing tables (RFC2519).
- Conservation - To maximize the lifetime of the public Internet address space resource, addresses must be distributed according to actual need and on the basis of immediate use. Therefore, stockpiling of address space and maintaining reservations must, in general, be avoided.

7.3 Documentation.
7.4 Fairness
All policies and practices relating to the use of public address space will apply fairly and equitably to all existing and potential members of AFRINIC regardless of their location, nationality, size,or any other factor.
8) Registration Requirements
a) All communication with AFRINIC will be in English.
b) All allocations and assignments will be registered in an AFRINIC database. Any unregistered assignemnts / allocations / sub-allocaion will be considered invalid. The registration data (name, IP block/range, contacts, status, etc..) must be correct at all times. This is necessary to support network operations.
Allocation policies and guidelines
8.1 Introduction
AFRINIC allocates ranges of IPv4 addresses to Local Internet Registries (LIRs). LIRs reassign or sub-allocate that space to their customers.
An Allocation is a range of IPv4 addresses from which sub-allocations and assignments are made. All LIR's assigning address space allocated from AFRINIC are also advised to adopt a set of policies that are consistent with the policies described in this document.. (CIDR - "Classless Inter-Domain Routing", is exlained in RFC1517-1959,)..
8.2 First Allocation
a) AFRINIC's minimum allocation is /22 or 1024 IPv4 addresses.
b) The organisation must be an AFRINIC member in good standing, and
c).
8.3. Slow start mechanism for first allocations
AFRINIC shall apply a slow start mechanism to all new LIRs. With respect to allocations made by AFRINIC, the first allocation an LIR receives will be the size of the minimum practical allocation described in Section 8.2 (a) unless otherwise justified.
The slow start policy is used by all RIR's to prevent allocations of large blocks of address space that may then remain substantially unassigned. AFRINIC implements the slow start mechanism in a consistent and fair manner for every LIR, and will apply the same principles and standards to every applicant for address space.
8.4 Additional Allocation.
AFRINIC will always try to allocate contiguous address ranges, allowing the LIR to minimise the number of route announcements it makes. However, it will not always be possible to allocate a range contiguous with the LIR's previous allocation.
8.5 Sub-Allocations
The minimum size of a sub-allocation is /24. It allows a reasonable number of small assignments to be made by a downstream ISP. An LIR may not sub-allocate IPv4 space above its suballocation).
9) Assignment policies and guidelines
LIR's must request approval from AFRINIC approval for all sub-allocations above their Sub-Allocation Window (see section 10.0 for SAW policy).
The following guidelines are intended to help LIRs and end-users in their search for equitable compromises:
9.1. Request forms are available at
When making sub-allocation from their SAW, LIR's should also ensure that such information is given by the end-user.
9.2.
9.3 Utilisation
Immediate utilisation of assignments should be at least 25% of the assigned space. After one year, unless special circumstances are defined, it should be at least 50%.
9.4.
9.5.
9.6.
10) Sub-Allocation Window (SAW)
An sub-allocation window (SAW) refers to the maximum number of IPv4 addresses that the LIR may sub-allocate to the end-users without seeking approval from AFRINIC. The SAW size is expressed in CIDR notatation.
AFRINIC will review sub-allocation made by the LIR's using their SAW in to ensure that policies are followed correctly. LIR's should also ensure that documentation for sub-allocation made using the SAW be similar to that requested for larger requests.
Below are a few guidelines for the SAW:
10.1 All new LIRs have a SAW of zero. All sub-allocations will need prior approval by AFRINIC.
10.2 The LIR cannot make any sub-allocation to the end-user above their SAW in a 12 months period (1 year). At the end of a calendar year from the approval of an SAW, the SAW is refreshed for one more year. In case the LIR's SAW is exhausted for a particular end-user, approval must be sought from AFRINIC for any other sub-allocation to the same end-user.

I have a problem with this. I don’t read the first line of a new novel and stop, judging its worth and merit on a single sentence alone.
I liken it to looking at a Van Gogh painting and focusing on a single brush stroke and missing the beauty and grandeur of the night sky.
A great first line can hook you in. But it’s when you understand it within the context of the first paragraph, the first page, the first chapter through to the closing line of the novel that its true power and beauty is revealed.
I read beyond the first line. I want to be caught up in the artistry of the writer, from the first line to the first paragraph to the first page to the first chapter to the closing line; to have the sentences form sedimentary layers over me as I delve into the artistry of the written word. Or like being covered in a large bucket of spaghetti, tangled in the complexity and power of words (you chose which simile works best for you).
The first sentence encapsulates the power, breadth, beauty and depth of a novel. It retains its power because the remainder of the novel bears out the enormity and scope hinted at in the first line.
But every sentence must work for the reader. Every sentence must be crafted as delicately and intricately as the first.
Stand back and admire the beauty of the whole. Then step closer and examine the individual brush strokes to understand why it has captured your imagination.
I used to write “clever” titles for blog posts and bizarre / “captivating” first paragraphs – I learned it really hindered technical writing LOL. I like opening gambits that make you want to sit in a corner and read the whole thing undisturbed. I notice however that some of the most innocuous opening sentences are the best. Cheap theatrics like ‘compelling’ first sentences have more to do with the way blog posts appear on a web page more than literature – and even less to do with the reality of the writing it often turns out.
You know, it’s terrifying to comment on Adam’s posts because I become acutely aware my grammar and syntax may not pass scrutiny.
It’s teh interwebz. No one cares about syntax or grammar, only trolling
Blogging can have cheap theatricality, but I write from an essayist’s perspective (curse of being an English teacher)
That was another excellent post today. Thanks so much for sharing. Keep up the fantastic job.

I don’t stop reading after the first sentence either, unless it’s a really bad first sentence.
I like to try and write good first lines but you’re right, they’re not the be-all and end-all. I think a good first few paragraphs are a more solid foundation, but I can’t help thinking that a coherent style, a solid structure and an interesting plot are more important. That said, I often write my first line last, after I know what is to come, so the first few lines can act as a better statement of intent.
There is a lot of buzz about first lines right now and it’s interesting to look at them on their own, but you’re absolutely right, they are only as good as the sentence that follows. When choosing a new book, I’ll give it at least one page, but if I’m not pulled in by something, no matter how good the blurb is, I won’t buy it.</span></div></div>

Armed with $430,000 the group will begin planning a strategy to provide "cradle-to-college and career" services for families in this neighbhood.
As City Director Ken Richardson noted at Tuesday's press conference, the services may already exsists, it is just often the service providers don't communicate with each other.
All six partners are excited to move forward with the project and offer their area of expertise to the neighborhood. Dr. Joel Anderson, UALR Chancellor, noted this new start for the neighborhood, "A new season is beginning today."
The Little Rock School District will work speficially with the schools that fall in the targeted Promise neighborhood, which include Franklin Elementary, Stephens Elementary, Bale Elementary, Forest Heights Middle, and Hall High. The emphasis will be to bring educational reform that results in a high quality education for these students from Pre-K to graduation. From this strong foundation these students will be able to attend college and embark on their dream profession.
Dr. Sadie Mitchell, Associate Superintendent for Elementary Education, acknowledged the enormity of the project and the district's dedication to its success, "One block at a time....We will have a 'whatever it takes' attitude.
The start-up grant will give UALR and its partners a year to prepare for the full-scale implementation of a program aimed at replicating the kind of private-public partnerships that made the Harlem Children’s Zone a model to provide children in the neighborhood “whatever it takes” to raise them up from babyhood to college..</span></div></div>

Small things with Great features : Black PepperPosted in by AICA Patrick
We get our black pepper from the pepper vine that can grow at least thirty feet tall in the stifling climates of the tropical parts of the world. The pepper vines actually bear fruit—small white flowers that turn into berries called peppercorns. Manufacturers take the peppercorns and collect them as whole berries or as ground black pepper.
Research studies have shown that black pepper actually has healthful properties such as:
· It is its ability to enhance the function of the digestive tract that makes it a good reason to put it in the dishes you cook.
· Diminish the amount of gas in the intestinal tract. This leads to less flatulence and bloating and is believed to be another benefit of increasing hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
· Has a great amount of antioxidant properties.
· Benefits against bacterial growth, particularly in the intestinal tract.
The good news is that all you need to do is put a little bit in your food every day.</span></div></div>

This is where it all started for hairdresser Hideaki Iijima, 61.
He is the founder of Soho, the second-largest chain of hair salons in Brazil. Soho has 28 locations in Sao Paulo, and serves more than 700,000 customers annually.
On Jan. 10, during a brief trip to Japan, Iijima visited hair salon 'imaii,' where he learned his trade. It was the first time he had returned there in more than a decade. Despite dredging through his memories, he had a hard time remembering exactly where the place was. Suddenly, he came to a standstill in front of a leaning power pole, rubbing his hands as he spoke.
"This is it, right here. I was brought here several times a day to be scolded beside this power pole in front of the salon."
Imaii, which has a floor space of only six tsubo (just under 20 square meters), is now located in a fashionable building that stands diagonally across from the power pole. Its proprietor, Hideo Imai, trained at the Vidal Sassoon salon in the United States in the 1970s, and is responsible for popularizing the innovative "Sassoon cut" in Japan.
Before joining Imai's salon, Iijima had already worked at several other establishments and become a competent hair stylist, but was troubled by a lack of confidence in his skills. Then one day he saw a magazine article about Imai who had just returned to Japan, and wasted no time in asking him for a job.
"Mr. Imai was strict, but I acquired the kind of skills and theory that I could be satisfied with, and I gained confidence in my abilities," Iijima says.
Before he knew it, he had become a popular hair stylist.
There was no end to customers requesting Iijima's services, and in one month alone he cut the hair of 760 clients. His days off were spent traveling the country to give seminars for hairdressers, and magazines and industry shows eagerly sought his expertise. Eventually, his monthly wages topped 1 million yen ($12,000).
"He brought us more business not only with his hairdressing talent, but also his cheerful conversational skills," Imai recalls.
However, after about five years, Iijima called time out on his career as a "charismatic hairdresser." He accepted an invitation from one of his former trainees who was managing a hair salon in Brazil, and emigrated there with his wife, 4-year-old son, and infant daughter. He was 28.
"I had dreamed of moving overseas since I was little," he says. "If I had stayed where I was, I thought I'd most likely end up regretting it."
* * *
Adjusting to life in another country wasn't easy.
He found himself at odds with his former trainee, and was fired after two years. The 10 million yen he had saved in Japan soon ran out. He borrowed three mirrors, and decided to test his mettle by working at a local salon.
For him, it was like a battleground.
The most senior hairdresser took the position closest to the salon's entrance, and newcomer Iijima was given the spot farthest back. Even if a customer came in without an appointment, they rarely made it into Iijima's chair. Names of non-existent clients were written in his column on the salon's appointment board, as well as other tricks intended to prevent him from gaining actual business. It was the underhanded work of his colleagues.
"I live off my daily income. I wish I had the stability of a fixed salary, like office workers do," Iijima lamented to his neighbor, Kenichi Shiomi, who worked for the local subsidiary of The Bank of Tokyo (currently Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ).
Shiomi, now 64, remembers it so well because Iijima wasn't the type to feel sorry for himself. His oldest son, Dai, 37, agrees.
"At the time, my father didn't understand much Portuguese," Dai says. "I think he couldn't communicate well with his customers, which must have really bothered him."
One day, Iijima came up with a plan. The shampoo sink was at the rear of the salon, so every customer had to pass by him. He carved his name into an eraser and made a stamp, then used it to add his name to the salon's business cards that he handed out to customers. Each time he would make a pitch for himself in broken Portuguese, saying, "I'm Iijima from overseas."
In order to make himself stand out while cutting a client's hair, he deliberately exaggerated his movements, clicking his fingers and flattering customers by saying things like "Fantastic!" to put them in a good mood.
To make allies of the salon's assistants and coffee-making staff, he gave them money on the sly. This used up a third of his wages.
* * *
When Iijima began to consider striking out on his own, he remembered a certain prophecy: "Your life will change when you turn 32."
It had been told to him by a client who read his fortune soon after he came to Brazil. Believing it, he opened a hair salon in an office district on his 32nd birthday, which attracted a clientele of businessmen. He opened at 9 a.m., and stayed open for as long as he had customers. Some days he even worked until 1 a.m. Within seven months, he had paid back the $90,000 he had borrowed from his friends and was eventually able to expand to a chain of shops.
Two days before his 40th birthday, in September 1990, Iijima awoke to discover that he had lost his sight. He had no idea why, and even wondered if he was about to die. After much agonizing, he came to accept that his fate was still his own, even if his luck had abandoned him.
When he made the decision to retire from hairdressing and just manage his Soho shops, he regained his sight, but only in his right eye.
"Maybe it was because I'd taken a load off my mind," he says.
Three years later, thieves broke into his home. A gun was pressed against his temple and his neck was slit with a knife. He barely escaped death by handing over his money and valuables.
After this string of nightmarish incidents, Iijima came to regard his life beyond the age of 40 as a bonus.
At the time, Brazil was wracked by inflation and the price of living escalated rapidly. The government froze savings accounts, which caused cash flow problems. While several of his rivals gradually went out of business, Iijima raised his prices almost every week and just managed to stay afloat.
Training his 1,100 staff members also posed difficulties.
"Many Brazilians don't think ahead, so it was difficult for them to understand what I meant when I talked about having dreams," he says. "It was a near-impossible task to improve their skills on an ongoing basis."
But Iijima himself has an awkward side and maneged to turn his complex into a driving force. He is aware of how others feel when they fail to accomplish something. Gradually, people began to flock to him.
"If you stay true to yourself and have a purpose, it gives you the courage to confront adversity," he says. "I'll keep doing things the Iijima way until I die."

Hideaki Iijima
Born in 1950 in Saitama Prefecture. Graduated from Kodama High School in Saitama, and gained his hairdressing license in 1970. Worked for several salons in metropolitan Tokyo before joining Hideo Imai's studio in Harajuku. Received acclaim for his hair-cutting techniques, becoming a popular stylist. Described as one of the first "charismatic hairdressers." Emigrated to Sao Paulo in 1979. Opened salon Soho in Sao Paulo in 1982, and turned it into Brazil's second-largest hair salon chain.
Memo
Family: Iijima divorced six years ago, and is currently single. He lives with his eldest son, Dai, and his wife, to whom he handed over the management of his salon business five years ago. His eldest daughter, Ai, also lives in Sao Paulo. His two children were born when he was still living in Japan, but he had the intention of moving overseas one day, "so I gave them names that could be easily pronounced by non-Japanese."
Motivation: Iijima's father ran a barbershop in Saitama that his eldest brother eventually took over, so he became a hairdresser to avoid becoming a commercial rival. He always used his favorite Japanese-made Tenyo scissors, which he sharpened himself.
On weekdays from 4:30 a.m., for an hour and a half, Iijima helps clean a park near his home. He has never missed a day in the past 15 years.

Welcome to”Another Movie Guy?”! This week I wondered whether I’d be able to find a connection between two new releases, Funny People and Burma VJ. One is a documentary about journalists who expose the truth about a military junta, whereas the other is a comedy about ill-behaved comedians. After Funny People, I left the theater in a beleaguered state, and it dawned on me that both movies are about forty minutes too long. Moreover, I wanted to like them more than I did. Unfortunately, the respective directors had too much faith in weak material.
Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to watch an open mic night. Several comedians performed, including one who embarrassingly bombed. At first the audience gave him the benefit of a doubt. Then he began a tedious bit about plastic surgery, and good will gave way to jeers and sarcastic laughter. The comedian’s only recourse was to discuss his insecurities and to insult the audience. Such a breakdown informed my thoughts on Funny People, Judd Apatow’s ambitious new comedy. It shrewdly examines a man who only knows how to be funny and mean, and what might happen if he’s forced to take stock of his life. The result is honest, yes, but not particularly rewarding. Short on laughs and long on running time, Apatow’s third directorial effort falters.
Adam Sandler stars as George Simmons, a sellout comedic actor who gains massive wealth with high-concept Hollywood garbage (not unlike Sandler himself). Leaving his mansion for the doctor’s office, George gets bad news: he has a rare blood disease, and the experimental treatment he’s given only has an eight percent success rate. Without friends, Simmons wanders to a comedy club, a place where he can be honest and people might listen. There he meets Ira (Seth Rogen), a struggling comedian who is jealous of his successful roommates (Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman). Much to Ira’s surprise, he’s asked by George to write some jokes for an upcoming corporate event. Ira agrees, and quickly becomes George’s confidant/whipping boy. Abusing the younger comedian is not rewarding enough, so George turns to Laura (Leslie Mann), his One Who Got Away. She still has feelings for George, and the two even consider a future together. Too bad Laura’s Australian husband (Eric Bana) is in the way.
Funny People is clearly more ambitious than Apatow’s prior movies, and here he overreaches. The problem is not with the actors. Rogen successfully plays a goofball who has trouble handling a serious situation. Sandler plays a character not unlike his roles from the mid-90s; like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Simmons can be obnoxious and cruel, with little empathy for others. Unlike Sandler’s goofy characters, George’s bad behavior has real consequences, and he’s a believable jackass. Some moments, particularly as Ira and George get to know one another, Sandler notably juxtaposes humor and buried pain. Still, the problem is that Funny People lacks the warm emotional core found in The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Apatow’s characters are realistic and their drama is authentic, yet that does not engender an overwrought climax.
The sequence in question is a long weekend at Laura’s home. Even if it gives Leslie Mann (Apatow’s wife) a chance to really act, the climax becomes tedious. Character choices are unclear, and too often these scenes announce emotion instead of showing it. The vulgar best friends, usually an Apatow highlight, are unfunny because they’re too selfish in such a dramatic universe (this is especially true during Ira’s romantic subplot, which never gains speed). Oh, and there are numerous cameos, from celebrities and up-and-comers alike, and their clever one-liners cannot save the exacerbating final scenes. Perhaps Apatow loves his movie too much to pare it down. Like the characters of Funny People, comedians are great company when they’re on point. When they’re not funny, their company can be almost unbearable, especially with a two and a half hour running time.
With Burma VJ, director Anders Østergaard tries to accomplish a noble thing with meager material. Late in the summer of 2007, Burma saw the beginnings of an uprising, one that eventually escalated to violence. After the 1988 riots left hundreds dead, the Burmese were too afraid to speak out. Everyone considers the monks a legitimate political force, so when they protest nearly 20 years later, ordinary citizens take to the streets. Østergaard documents the uprising with the help of undercover journalists (like the recent Tehran protests, borders were closed to foreign press). Using the pseudonym Joshua, a journalist serves as narrator, and is never shown on camera. He describes how he and his colleagues would risk their lives for newsworthy images. Secret police scatter throughout the city, and Joshua can never be sure when they will spot him. As the conflict escalates, Joshua flatly notes that more deaths are the only way to stir global conscience.
The principle weakness with Burma VJ is the quality of the smuggled footage. Joshua and others had to contend with military police and omnipresent fear, and it follows they could not always get the best shot. I realize the journalists were brave and did the best they could, yet they give Østergaard little to work with, and so his documentary lacks emotional power. At the height of the protests, for example, a journalist snags a shot of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (recent Gandhi prize winner), who has been living under house arrest. It should be a climactic, stirring moment, one that inspires others to act. Joshua says the image is blurry and the woman is at a distance, yet is moved to tears. Audience members lack Joshua’s immediate investment in the struggle, and will not have a similar reaction. That is not to say, however, that all the footage is uninspiring. Journalists catch moments when ordinary Burmese proclaim their desire for martyrdom, and there is suspense as a journalist hides from gunfire. Some especially stirring shots capture the scope of the protests. Østergaard and Joshua have moving stuff, just not enough for a feature-length documentary.
That’s it for this week’s “Another Movie Guy?”! Tune in next week when romantic comedy overload continues.</span></div></div>

A great Sunday at STORYCHURCH. We concluded our “Beyond Left &amp; Right” series. If you missed any of these, the podcast is a great way to catch up.

What an awesome morning at STORYCHURCH today! I love this church!
We continued our BEYOND LEFT AND RIGHT series and talked about “power over” vs “power under”. ”Power over” is when we try to use rules and regulations to enforce a particular culture or way of life.

One cliff stood to the north towards Michmash, the other to the south towards Geba. Jonathan said to his young armour-bearer, ‘Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.’ – 1 Sam 14:5-6!</span></div></div>

P. Sanders: Yeah! I have a lot of big stuff coming, a tour is coming up- Pop Explosion Tour! But there’s a few other tours that I might be doing as well simultaneously; so it’s about to be really big, a lot of shows, a lot of places not even just in America but overseas as well, so can’t wait!!

<p><strong>Falcon RefinedWeb is a massive English web dataset built by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tii.ae">TII</a> and released under an ODC-By 1.0 license.</strong></p>
<p>See the 📓 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116">paper on arXiv</a> for more details. </p>
<p>RefinedWeb is built through stringent filtering and large-scale deduplication of CommonCrawl; we found models trained on RefinedWeb to achieve performance in-line or better than models trained on curated datasets, while only relying on web data. </p>
<p>RefinedWeb is also "multimodal-friendly": it contains links and alt texts for images in processed samples.</p>
<p>This public extract should contain 500-650GT depending on the tokenizer you use, and can be enhanced with the curated corpora of your choosing. This public extract is about ~500GB to download, requiring 2.8TB of local storage once unpacked. </p>

		Curation Rationale
	</span>
</h3>
<p>Falcon RefinedWeb is built on-top of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://commoncrawl.org">CommonCrawl</a>, using the Macrodata Refinement Pipeline, which combines content extraction, filtering heuristics, and deduplication. </p>
<p>In designing RefinedWeb, we abided to the following philosophy: </p>
<ul>
<li>(1) <strong>Scale first.</strong> We intend MDR to produce datasets to be used to train 40-200B parameters models, thus requiring trillions of tokens <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">(Hoffmann et al., 2022)</a>. For English-only RefinedWeb, we target a size of 3-6 trillion tokens. Specifically, we eschew any labour intensive human curation process, and focus on CommonCrawl instead of disparate single-domain sources.</li>
<li>(2) <strong>Strict deduplication.</strong> Inspired by the work of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06499">Lee et al., 2021</a>, which demonstrated the value of deduplication for large language models, we implement a rigorous deduplication pipeline. We combine both exact and fuzzy deduplication, and use strict settings leading to removal rates far higher than others datasets have reported.</li>
<li>(3) <strong>Neutral filtering.</strong> To avoid introducing further undesirable biases into the model, we avoid using ML-based filtering outside of language identification (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08758">Dodge et al., 2021</a>; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07445">Welbl et al., 2021</a>) . We stick to simple rules and heuristics, and use only URL filtering for adult content.</li>
</ul>
<p>During its development, we iterated on RefinedWeb by measuring the zero-shot performance of models trained on development version of the dataset. Our main goal was to maximize the performance obtained, bridging the gap between curated and web data. We also manually audited samples to identify potential filtering improvements.</p>

		Data Collection and Preprocessing
	</span>
</h3>
<p>We applied extensive preprocessing and cleaning of the data, using our Macrodata Refinement Pipeline. </p>
<p>We first filter URLs to remove adult content using a blocklist and a score system, we then use <code>trafilatura</code> to extract content from pages, and perform language identification with the <code>fastText</code> classifier from CCNet (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00359">Wenzek et al., 2019</a>). After this first preprocessing stage, we filter data using heuristics from MassiveWeb (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446">Rae et al., 2021</a>), and our own line-wise corrections. </p>
<p>Finally, we run extensive deduplication, removing URLs revisited across dumps and performing subsequently fuzzy and exact substring deduplication.</p>

<p>As RefinedWeb is built upon publicly available web pages, it may contain sensitive information such as emails, phone numbers, or IP addresses. We believe that deduplication may have helped reduced the prevalence of PII in the dataset, but practitioners working with RefinedWeb should take care.</p>
