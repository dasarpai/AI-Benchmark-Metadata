Earlier this year, VA established a new Center for Innovation that oversees an \&quot;innovators network\&quot; to provide training, support and funding for problem solving.\n\n\n\nThe initiatives showcased at the D.C. event addressed several widely recognized issues at VA, from problems with access to care to suicide prevention, mental health services and technology.\n\n\n\nThe 33 projects pitched at the event included: Fitbits for aging patients and Apple watches for veterans in rural regions to monitor physical activity; using nurses to triage same-day appointment requests to ensure immediate care for those who it; and increasing access to complimentary activities like yoga, art and writing to improve wellness.\n\n\n\nAll were funded by one of three VA programs, including \&quot;Spark\&quot; grants that give $5,000 to $10,000 to get an idea rolling, \&quot;Seed\&quot; grants of less than $50,000 that can be obtained once an idea has demonstrated the project will work and \&quot;Spread\&quot; grants between $100,000 and $500,000 to expand the projects to other VA facilities.\n\n\n\nVA Boston Healthcare System gastroenterologist Dr. Navin Kumar used a Spark grant to develop a smartphone app that would help patients prep properly for a colonoscopy.\n\n\n\nHooking his audience with slides of improperly prepped colons and unsettling statistics, Kumar said doctors miss pre-cancerous growths in about a third of patients who didn't follow the required bowel cleansing protocol before their procedure.\n\n\n\nHis app, developed with the help of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, guides patients through the proper diet, fluid intake and bowel prep the week before their colonoscopy. Following Kumar's presentation, an audience member asked to speak with him about patenting the design.\n\n\n\n\&quot;This is great,\&quot; Kumar said after meeting with several administrators and doctors interested in his creation. \&quot;When I walked in this room, I was like, where am I? It's so modern, which is not usually what people think of when they hear 'VA.'\&quot;\n\n\n\nShulkin said the employees selected to present at the D.C. event had to demonstrate that their projects were attractive to VA facilities beyond their own, and the presentations were streamed to major VA facilities, where staff members were watching.\n\n\n\n\&quot;These are clearly ideas that not only can help VA but can help private health facilities around the country,\&quot; he said.\n\n\n\nShulkin said he thinks the value of the demonstration day lies in the ideas that eventually will be adopted and those that have yet to be conceived.\n\n\n\n\&quot;The VA had become a place that was so criticized that people didn't feel they were allowed to enjoy what they are doing. But when you combine the passion people have for caring for veterans with the ability to use their brains and implement ideas, it brings joy back to work,\&quot; he said. \&quot;It's exciting.\&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.06412373,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.064124&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:234,&quot;score&quot;:0.005935072},{&quot;begin&quot;:234,&quot;end&quot;:417,&quot;score&quot;:0.010690071},{&quot;begin&quot;:417,&quot;end&quot;:530,&quot;score&quot;:0.007184561},{&quot;begin&quot;:530,&quot;end&quot;:755,&quot;score&quot;:0.015132698},{&quot;begin&quot;:755,&quot;end&quot;:906,&quot;score&quot;:0.009648831},{&quot;begin&quot;:906,&quot;end&quot;:1025,&quot;score&quot;:0.010204159},{&quot;begin&quot;:1025,&quot;end&quot;:1187,&quot;score&quot;:0.004963247},{&quot;begin&quot;:1187,&quot;end&quot;:1380,&quot;score&quot;:0.012078391},{&quot;begin&quot;:1380,&quot;end&quot;:1729,&quot;score&quot;:0.004928539},{&quot;begin&quot;:1729,&quot;end&quot;:3866,&quot;score&quot;:0.05093802}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 234,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.005935072\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 234,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 417,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010690071\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 417,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 530,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.007184561\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 530,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 755,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.015132698\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 755,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 906,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009648831\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 906,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1025,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010204159\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1025,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1187,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.004963247\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1187,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1380,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012078391\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1380,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1729,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.004928539\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1729,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 3866,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.05093802\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Every turn of the cards changes the situation.

Many dedicated and intelligent\nindividuals have produced elegant solutions for problems other than those they\nwere tasked to solve. Therefore, a good executive decision maker participates in\nproblem definition because this step establishes the goal for everything else\nthat follows and places a premium on professional judgment.READ MORE\n\nConsensus Team Decision Making\nThe Westerner and the Japanese man mean something different when they talk of\n\&quot;making a decision.\&quot; In the West, all the emphasis is on the answer to the\nquestion. To the Japanese, however, the important element in decision making is\ndefining the question. The crucial steps are to decide whether there is a need\nfor a decision and what the decision is about. And it is in that step that the\nJapanese aim at attaining consensus. Indeed, it is this step that, to the\nJapanese, is the essence of decision. The answer to the question (what the West\nconsiders the decision) follows from its definition. During the process that\nprecedes the decision, no mention is made of what the answer might be. . . .\nThus the whole process is focused on finding out what the decision is really\nabout, not what the decision should be.READ MORE\n\nEffective Decision Making\nOne of the critical, but often overlooked, requirements for effective leadership\nis sound decision making. This is especially true as we soar ever higher into\nthe ranks of middle and upper management. Typically, as this progression occurs,\nleaders become more focused on strategic decisions relating to plans, policies,\nprograms and personnel, and less consumed with day-to-day tactical concerns.\nGood decision making, especially in middle and upper management, will therefore\nlikely increase overall organizational health and effectiveness. Understanding\nthe meaning and art of deciding, therefore, is paramount.READ MORE\n\nEthical Decision-Making: The Link Between Ambiguity and\nAccountability\nA growing body of literature thoroughly examines the topic of ethics in public\nservice from numerous, contrary, and complementary perspectives. What is ethics\nin public service? Ethics in public service is the study of the nature of\nmorals and moral choices and the rules governing a profession that define\nprofessional conduct (Bruce, 2001, p. xiii). How do we know if it is effective?\nWho determines? How do we measure it? In answering these questions it becomes\nremarkably clear that there are no absolutes. Nor is there any single school of\nthought or theory to guide the inquiry. Why do we try to understand ethics in\npublic service? The answer is clear: because we intuitively know it makes a\ndifference.READ MORE\n\nNCOs and Values-Based Decision Making\nIn the Army of One, senior leaders look to the NCO Corps to embrace a value\nsystem that develops character and to lead soldiers. The Army depends on its\nNCOs to create the environment and set the tempo for success in full-spectrum\noperations. Successful NCOs anticipate change, exploit every opportunity to meet\nthe units objectives and motivate their subordinates to higher levels of\nproductivity to achieve the units goals.

My friend Karla was wearing a sexy leopard print dress and I wanted to pick makeup that fit the occasion. To me, animal print can often be a neutral color. As a result, I went for a smokey eye (can't go wrong with that), but decided to mix it up.\n\nClick here to see more!A lot of people who aren't used to color get a little scared when you try to apply something outside of the neutral category. The key is to use a \&quot;safe\&quot; color, in this case silver, and place it on the lid so that it fades into your brighter color. That way, the whole eye isn't too vibrant, but you can still add color in the middle and outer part of the lid. I picked more of a royal blue tone so that it would be a bit more wearable.\n\nI used the bright royal blue from my Best of Both World's Yaby Palette. The color is super rich and pigmented. I also used a darker blue from my Barbie Stila palette as the outer v/contour color.\n\nKarla was one of my last models in my chair. I think I had about 15 minutes to do her makeup...not too shabby right? It helps that I have most of my makeup in palettes...it makes for quick mixing and matching.\n\nI loved how it came out...it really made her eyes pop, and I think the guys agreed because they couldn't keep their hands off her at the club, wink wink.\n\nThat's all for now, stay tuned for more makeup breakdowns from Caress Girls Night Out event!\n\nProduct Reviews &amp; Company Sponsorships\n\nAbout Me\n\nHi Guys, my name is Ren, a 30something Filipino-American residing in Atlanta, and obsessed with everything makeup.

The most commonly source of information used for this has been the Population and Housing Census of 2011 (PCH_2011).The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of PHC_2011 and develop a deprivation index (DI) by Basic Healthcare Area (BHA) and to analyse its association with mortality in Aragon. Ecological study by BHA. Since PHC_2011 was a sample of the population it was validated by the Chi-square test for homogeneity. 26 socioeconomic indicators were calculated. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR). Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were conducted using the indicators in which a significant correlation was found. Components with eigenvalues higher than 1 were extracted, and the rotated matrix (Varimax) was obtained. PCA from each component were conducted, extracting only one factor. BHA were grouped into, according to the deprivation index values. Mortality rates adjusted to the European Standard Population by age, sex and quartile were calculated. The most discriminant factor by quartiles was considered DI. A different DI for urban areas was obtained from the same variables. The validation of PHC sample detected 4 underrepresented BHA. 17 socioeconomic indicators were significatively correlated with SMR. From the first PCA, 3 components were obtained. The DI included %unemployment, %eventual workers, % insufficient education 16-64 years old and %foreigners. The % of variance explained by the DI was 59.7% and 73.8% in urban areas. In men, mortality in the quartile with the lowest deprivation (544,7 per 105; CI95%: 515,8-573,6) was significatively lower than in the most deprivated areas(618,7 per 105;CI95%:589,4-648,0). This new DI allows us to identify deprived BHA.

The song's iconic intro, played by Bud Isaacs, was said to have sent legions of lap steel guitar players scurrying to their closets for wire coat hangers, with which they attempted to modify their existing instruments to get the pitch shifting effect achieved by Isaacs.\n\nCover versions\nOn August 23, 1966, Connie Smith recorded the song which appeared on her album Connie in the Country (1967) \nIn 1968, Jimmy Martin recorded the song which appeared in the album “Free-born Man” (1969)\nIn 1971, Jimmy Dean and Dottie West recorded a duet of the song, which hit the Top 40 on the country charts\nIn 1981, Kippi Brannon had her sole hit on the country charts with her version of the song\nIn 2014, The Haden Triplets (Petra, Tanya and Rachel), daughters of jazz double-bassist Charlie Haden, recorded the song for their debut album on Jack White's Third Man Records.\n\nReferences\n \n\nCategory:1954 songs\nCategory:Webb Pierce songs\nCategory:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles\nCategory:Songs written by Webb Pierce&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Wikipedia (en)\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.047495455,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.047495&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:7,&quot;score&quot;:0.027237365},{&quot;begin&quot;:7,&quot;end&quot;:136,&quot;score&quot;:0.020269485},{&quot;begin&quot;:136,&quot;end&quot;:318,&quot;score&quot;:0.0041129007},{&quot;begin&quot;:318,&quot;end&quot;:528,&quot;score&quot;:0.02792408},{&quot;begin&quot;:528,&quot;end&quot;:799,&quot;score&quot;:0.062125895},{&quot;begin&quot;:799,&quot;end&quot;:815,&quot;score&quot;:0.011106567},{&quot;begin&quot;:815,&quot;end&quot;:924,&quot;score&quot;:0.06971766},{&quot;begin&quot;:924,&quot;end&quot;:1015,&quot;score&quot;:0.008225801},{&quot;begin&quot;:1015,&quot;end&quot;:1123,&quot;score&quot;:0.008121678},{&quot;begin&quot;:1123,&quot;end&quot;:1547,&quot;score&quot;:0.007566349}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 7,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.027237365\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 7,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 136,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.020269485\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 136,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 318,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0041129007\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 318,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 528,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.02792408\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 528,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 799,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.062125895\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 799,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 815,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.011106567\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 815,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 924,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.06971766\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 924,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1015,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008225801\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1015,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1123,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008121678\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1123,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1547,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.007566349\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Surgical aspirator cannulas and suction devices have been used for many years to remove fluid from the body. These suction devices typically comprise a hollow tube, or cannula, having an opening at each end. The distal opening (with respect to the patient) is attached to a source of vacuum. The opposite, proximal, end is introduced into the body and fluid is removed through the cannula by force of the suction. Typically, when a vacuum is provided from the vacuum source, the fluid is sucked into the opening on the proximal end of the tube, through the tube, and into a receptacle disposed “downstream” with respect to the tube. Such suction devices may become clogged, requiring cleaning of the suction devices.

The sources said the three told Greenblatt that they believe a strong Palestinian economy is essential for the two-state solution to become reality.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian sources, Greenblatt told the three that, for now, the administration has no intention of engaging with the PA. It was understood that the administration will likely only do so after Trump meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 15, the sources said.\n\nThe three businessmen did not respond to efforts to reach them on Saturday evening.\n\nA spokesperson for the US National Security Council denied Greenblatt had said the administration did not intend to engage Ramallah.\n\n“Earlier this week, White House officials, including Jason Greenblatt, held a constructive introductory meeting with a group of Palestinian business leaders who were visiting Washington for meetings with US officials, Congress, and other organizations,” a statement from the NSC read. “This meeting was one of many such engagements the administration is conducting across all issue areas. The assertion that Mr. Greenblatt said that the United States does not intend to have a relationship with the Palestinian Authority at this juncture is false.”\n\nAmerican relations with the PA may soon be put to the test, in light of Trump’s repeated promises to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The prospect of a relocation has angered Palestinian and Arab leadership, with the former threatening such action would create a regional crisis.\n\nSince his inauguration, Trump has appeared to back away from that pledge, saying in a recent interview that the move was “not easy” and giving it no more than “a chance” of occurring.\n\nIn another development that may encourage PA leadership, the White House said Thursday that settlement expansion “may not be helpful,” in a possible blow to Israeli leadership that has seen the Trump administration as wholly supportive of the settlement enterprise.\n\nIn late January, a senior Palestinian source told The Times of Israel that Washington froze the transfer of $221 million which was quietly authorized by the Obama administration in its final hours.\n\nUS officials conveyed to PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah that the funds were not expected to be handed over in the immediate future, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nErekat lashed out at the White House on Monday, telling Newsweek that if Trump’s first days in office were representative of the shape of things to come, “God help us, God help the whole world.\n\n“We have sent them letters, written messages, they don’t even bother to respond to us,” he said of the new administration.\n\n“It’s time for President Trump to… focus on what this region needs,” Erekat said. “What we need in this region is peace, what we need in this region is dialogue, what we need in this region is to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to the table.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. According to Jordan’s official news agency Petra, the two “agreed on the need to intensify efforts to reach a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”\n\nStuart Winer contributed to this report.\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that the NSC denied Greenblatt said the administration did not intend to engage with the PA yet.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.13969667,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.139697&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:122,&quot;score&quot;:0.16482529},{&quot;begin&quot;:122,&quot;end&quot;:357,&quot;score&quot;:0.01596569},{&quot;begin&quot;:357,&quot;end&quot;:692,&quot;score&quot;:0.025005542},{&quot;begin&quot;:692,&quot;end&quot;:786,&quot;score&quot;:0.029125832},{&quot;begin&quot;:786,&quot;end&quot;:966,&quot;score&quot;:0.038911518},{&quot;begin&quot;:966,&quot;end&quot;:1115,&quot;score&quot;:0.013605545},{&quot;begin&quot;:1115,&quot;end&quot;:1256,&quot;score&quot;:0.049212243},{&quot;begin&quot;:1256,&quot;end&quot;:1412,&quot;score&quot;:0.00999591},{&quot;begin&quot;:1412,&quot;end&quot;:1497,&quot;score&quot;:0.018742332},{&quot;begin&quot;:1497,&quot;end&quot;:4355,&quot;score&quot;:0.08689302}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 122,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.16482529\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 122,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 357,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.01596569\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 357,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 692,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.025005542\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 692,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 786,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.029125832\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 786,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 966,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.038911518\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 966,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1115,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013605545\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1115,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1256,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.049212243\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1256,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1412,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.00999591\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1412,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1497,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.018742332\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1497,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 4355,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.08689302\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nImplementation of or in foldr and foldl' in Data.List\n\nHere is the declaration of or function from Prelude\nor = foldr (||) False\n\nThis implementation is fine if the list fields contains at least one True\nIf the list contains all False then overflow can happen and  We have to reduce till last element\nHere is the implementation using foldl'\nor = foldl' (||) False\n\nHere though it is inefficient since it has to reduce till last element of the list irrespective of the contents of the list argument. But we are guaranteed that we will not encounter an overflow.\nSo question is why not use the safer foldl' version\n\nA:\n\nIf the list contains all False then […] We have to reduce till last element.\n\nThat is correct. \n\nIf the list contains all False then overflow can happen […].\n\nThat's not. Other than functions like (+), (||) isn't strict in both arguments. It only pattern matches the left one:\n(||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool\n(||) True _ = True\n(||) _    x = x\n\nTherefore, if we use the definition of foldr for lists, we get:\nfoldr (||) False [False,False])\n  = False || (foldr (||) False [False]) -- use: False || x = x\n  = foldr (||) False [False]\n  = False || (foldr (||) False [])      -- use: False || x = x\n  = foldr (||) False []\n  = False\n\nHowever, if we use a function where both arguments need to be fully evaluated we get into problems:\nfoldr (+) 0 [1,2]\n  = 0 + (foldr (+) 1 [2])  -- cannot reduce (+), since it needs right hand side\n  = 0 + (1 + (foldr (+) 2 []))\n  = 0 + (1 + (2))\n  = 0 + (3)\n  = 3\n\nWhich is why you should use foldl' in this case. But for right-lazy functions like (||) or (:), foldr is perfectly fine.\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.043031808,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.043032&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:58,&quot;score&quot;:0.014299706},{&quot;begin&quot;:58,&quot;end&quot;:111,&quot;score&quot;:0.04543531},{&quot;begin&quot;:111,&quot;end&quot;:133,&quot;score&quot;:0.14104263},{&quot;begin&quot;:133,&quot;end&quot;:208,&quot;score&quot;:0.013605545},{&quot;begin&quot;:208,&quot;end&quot;:305,&quot;score&quot;:0.059328925},{&quot;begin&quot;:305,&quot;end&quot;:345,&quot;score&quot;:0.030327583},{&quot;begin&quot;:345,&quot;end&quot;:368,&quot;score&quot;:0.101391904},{&quot;begin&quot;:368,&quot;end&quot;:503,&quot;score&quot;:0.124380715},{&quot;begin&quot;:503,&quot;end&quot;:565,&quot;score&quot;:0.012494888},{&quot;begin&quot;:565,&quot;end&quot;:1638,&quot;score&quot;:0.04680874}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 58,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.014299706\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 58,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 111,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.04543531\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 111,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 133,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.14104263\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 133,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 208,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013605545\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 208,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 305,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.059328925\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 305,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 345,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.030327583\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 345,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 368,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.101391904\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 368,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 503,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.124380715\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 503,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 565,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012494888\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 565,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1638,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.04680874\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I haven’t written much this week, on account of falling into a massive Fallout 4-sized hole (crater) in the ground.

The official word is: “While we won’t have any major announcements for Mass Effect: Andromeda this N7 Day, keep an eye out on Saturday for some surprises that we’re sure you’ll enjoy.”\n\nCryptic.\n\nThe weekly delay news\n\nInXile announced this week that Torment: Tides of Numenera (a.k.a. sort of the Planescape: Torment spiritual successor) is officially delayed until next year, though to be honest I think we all had sort of guessed that already. There hasn’t been much news about Torment in a while, and a beta test is supposed to happen before launch. And 2015 is basically over and done with. Better luck next year.\n\n2K’s hero-driven shooter Battleborn also got pushed back a bit, from February to May of 2016.\n\nIt’s not porn, I swear\n\nThe Witcher is headed for film. Well, technically it’s headed for film “again” since there was already a movie made in 2001, but I’d warrant more people outside Poland know about Geralt this time around.\n\nThe new film is being made in conjunction with the studio that produced The Witcher 3’s gorgeous opening cinematic, so I have (maybe) high hopes. Via a press release: “The film will be an introduction to the Witcher’s world and is planned to be the beginning of a series. The film will be based on themes from the short stories ‘The Witcher’ and ‘Lesser Evil’ from ‘The Last Wish’ collection.”\n\nParagon\n\nEpic “revealed” a new game called Paragon this week. Barely. So far, this is all we have to go on:\n\nWho took over EA’s body?\n\nIs this real life? It can’t be. EA subsidiary Ghost Games says it will not be selling DLC for its latest Need for Speed (coming to PC in early 2016). Let me repeat: Electronic Arts is not selling DLC in one of its games.\n\nIn an interview with Vice, Need for Speed creative director Craig Sullivan said “Everything we’re doing is focusing on listening to what the fans are asking for. They’re certainly not saying to us, ‘Can you build a load of stuff and charge us for it?’ They’re not saying that, so we’re not doing that.”\n\n“The plan is that there are no transactions in this game,” he continued. “All of the content that we’re going to give you—a pretty substantial amount in the future, starting pretty soon—is going to be free. That’s what players deserve.”\n\nSounds like CD Projekt Red’s evangelizing rubbed off on someone else.\n\nWho took over Activision’s body?\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III is getting mod tools on the PC. Seriously. And community maps. Seriously. Like, you won’t need to pay for maps. You will have an infinite supply of community-made content. Seriously.\n\nThis is one hell of a weird week for people who usually rant against DLC.\n\nHope you stocked up on VRAM\n\nAhead of its launch on November 19, Ubisoft’s revealed the Minimum and Recommended Specs for Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. They’re recommending you pack at least 3GB of VRAM for an optimal experience. Also 50GB of storage. Hopefully it plays better than last year.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.16827796,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.168278&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:116,&quot;score&quot;:0.09333697},{&quot;begin&quot;:116,&quot;end&quot;:226,&quot;score&quot;:0.014577369},{&quot;begin&quot;:226,&quot;end&quot;:319,&quot;score&quot;:0.1668969},{&quot;begin&quot;:319,&quot;end&quot;:358,&quot;score&quot;:0.1423886},{&quot;begin&quot;:358,&quot;end&quot;:407,&quot;score&quot;:0.038911518},{&quot;begin&quot;:407,&quot;end&quot;:415,&quot;score&quot;:0.079307266},{&quot;begin&quot;:415,&quot;end&quot;:502,&quot;score&quot;:0.02193547},{&quot;begin&quot;:502,&quot;end&quot;:518,&quot;score&quot;:0.015826859},{&quot;begin&quot;:518,&quot;end&quot;:703,&quot;score&quot;:0.010273575},{&quot;begin&quot;:703,&quot;end&quot;:3439,&quot;score&quot;:0.12180476}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 116,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.09333697\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 116,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 226,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.014577369\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 226,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 319,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.1668969\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 319,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 358,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.1423886\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 358,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 407,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.038911518\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 407,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 415,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.079307266\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 415,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 502,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.02193547\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 502,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 518,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.015826859\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 518,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 703,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010273575\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 703,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 3439,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.12180476\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;While a variety of pillows exist in the market today, none have the specific purpose of simultaneously giving neck and back support, while also allowing adjustment of the firmness, as well as providing a convenient air pump to inflate the pillows for desired firmness and a convenient storage bag.

Considering seventh round picks rarely turn out to be worth anything, it made sense for the Flyers to cast those concerns aside and take a chance on potentially skilled player.\n\nPosition: Defense\n\nBirthdate: May 31, 1994 (21)\n\nAcquired Via: 2012 2012 NHL Draft -- Round 7, Pick 201\n\n2014-15 Team/League: Avangard Omsk / Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod , KHL - 2 G, 3 A in 35 GP\n\nNationality: Russian (Moscow)\n\nSize: 6'2\&quot;, 207\n\nContract Status: None\n\nRanking in August 2014 25 Under 25: 19\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we last reviewed Vasiliev, he had just recently made the jump from Russia's major junior league to the KHL, where he had established himself as a third pairing, \&quot;stay at home\&quot; defenseman. The general gist was that even if he was prone to the occasional blunder and wasn't putting up stellar offensive numbers, he was getting ice time as a teenager in a league with some relatively skilled players.\n\nSo what has changed since then? Well, his offensive numbers haven't really jumped too much -- he put up 5 points in his 35 KHL games last season -- and it seems that his progression hasn't come along too much. Vasiliev attended the Flyers development camp back in July, and Bill Meltzer (who is always great in terms of prospect reports) had this to say:\n\nHe has been in the KHL for two-plus seasons but his ice time and development rate have been sporadic. The player himself said that added strength is a must to play the style that makes him effective. His most recently reported height and weight are 6-foot-1 and 203 pounds. Thus far, he has been a passable young KHL defenseman on a third pairing but not a player who jumps out as a clear candidate for the NHL. Injuries have been an issue, as has lack of opportunity. Going from a strong Avangard Omsk club midway through last season to a much weaker Nizhny Novgorod (his third KHL organization) meant more playing time. He played well in nine games for his new club.\n\nSo, yeah, not much has changed since last year. Vasiliev is a serviceable third pairing KHL defenseman, but there's obviously no indication as of now that he'll ever sniff ice time in the NHL. It's hard to expect much more out of a seventh round draft pick, though.\n\nObviously, the kid deserves a bit more time before any final verdict is given on his overall abilities, but we're probably best at tempering our expectations. Plus, given that the Flyers have a fairly strong pipeline of capable defenseman, I can't imagine he'll be cracking the Flyers roster anytime soon.\n\nRegardless, his potential upside and decent enough professional play are enough to earn him the 25th spot on our list. Here's a video of him scoring a fun little goal at World Juniors back in 2014:\n\nHow we voted for Valeri Vasiliev:\n\nAl Allison Andrew Charlie Collin Kelly Kevin Kurt Mary Meseret Ryan Travis 20 N/A 23 N/A 21 20 N/A N/A 21 N/A 23 N/A\n\nWho we voted for at No. 25:&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.045091953,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.045092&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:173,&quot;score&quot;:0.03599298},{&quot;begin&quot;:173,&quot;end&quot;:409,&quot;score&quot;:0.028782474},{&quot;begin&quot;:409,&quot;end&quot;:586,&quot;score&quot;:0.013813793},{&quot;begin&quot;:586,&quot;end&quot;:605,&quot;score&quot;:0.012008976},{&quot;begin&quot;:605,&quot;end&quot;:635,&quot;score&quot;:0.008052262},{&quot;begin&quot;:635,&quot;end&quot;:691,&quot;score&quot;:0.009787662},{&quot;begin&quot;:691,&quot;end&quot;:779,&quot;score&quot;:0.018881164},{&quot;begin&quot;:779,&quot;end&quot;:810,&quot;score&quot;:0.015549194},{&quot;begin&quot;:810,&quot;end&quot;:827,&quot;score&quot;:0.0129808},{&quot;begin&quot;:827,&quot;end&quot;:3278,&quot;score&quot;:0.050585672}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 173,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.03599298\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 173,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 409,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.028782474\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 409,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 586,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013813793\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 586,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 605,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012008976\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 605,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 635,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008052262\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 635,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 691,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009787662\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 691,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 779,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.018881164\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 779,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 810,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.015549194\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 810,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 827,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0129808\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 827,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 3278,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.050585672\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;With the signing of All-Star big man Al Horford in July, the Celtics put an end to the myth that top NBA free agents would not come to Boston. Several Celtics players helped recruit Horford with their active involvement in the process. A sizable contingent of players — including Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk — attended pitch meetings with top free-agent targets such as Horford and Kevin Durant after both hit the open market last month.\n\nOne piece of the team’s core who was notably absent at pitch meetings during free agency was Avery Bradley. While speaking at a Celtics and Arbella Insurance home court makeover unveiling event on Monday, the shooting guard explained his decision to stay on the sidelines during much of the process.\n\n\n“I didn’t [recruit] that much,” Bradley said when asked by reporters about his attempts to recruit Durant. “Me and Kevin are like brothers so we talk all the time. So I’m not going to talk to him about that, you know what I mean? I was more asking him how he’s doing. I was actually with him a week before all that stuff went down at a camp in Austin [Texas], so I really wasn’t that much involved. I was more worried about myself, just getting healthy and making sure I was continuing to work out.”\n\nBradley and Durant both played basketball at the University of Texas. Even though their stints with the Longhorns were separated by a few seasons, they have developed a strong bond. While the 25-year-old would have loved Durant as a teammate in the NBA, he remains supportive of the All-Star’s decision to sign with Golden State.\n\n“All I can say is that I’m happy for him, and I feel like he’s part of a great organization. And I wish the best for him. Kevin’s a really good guy and an even better player,” he said.\n\nWhile the Celtics fell short in landing Durant, Bradley was not surprised that the team was able to add to the roster in a big way with Horford.\n\n\n“To be honest, even though some people would say this is a tough place to come to obviously, I think if I were a player, I would want to come here. With all the history and fans, that alone would make me want to come here. I can’t speak for all the other guys in the NBA, but I wasn’t surprised at all that [Horford] would want to come here.\n\n“Who wouldn’t want to be a part of an organization like this, with a coach like we have, and the type of guys that we have? Seeing how we are just growing every single year, improving every single year, I feel like every player would want to be a part of a process like this.”&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;:

But until recently, it was very rare to see the behavior in wild animals.\n\nMIKE BOSSLEY\n\nBillie the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin liked to walk on water. She’d pump her tail vigorously back and forth, forcing her entire body out of the water, so she’d skim backwards along the surface as if she were moonwalking.\n\nMike Bossley, a researcher at the wildlife charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC), was the first to observe Billie performing the trick; he caught her doing it in the bays and estuaries around Adelaide, Australia, in the 1990s and early 2000s. At the time, it was common to see trained dolphins tail walk in marine parks. But Billie was wild.\n\n“Tail walking in wild dolphins is indeed rare,” says Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University who studies dolphin behavior. “I have seen it only once in 32 years of observing wild dolphins.”\n\nBossley’s now interested in what the behavior reveals about how the animals learn from one another. Billie probably learned to tail walk during a brief stint in captivity, he says. She was born off the southern coast of Australia, then trapped in a polluted harbor near Adelaide in 1987 and taken to a dolphinarium. She was never trained to tail walk, but watched the five other dolphins there train for three weeks. She was then released back into the wild.\n\nIn 1995, Bossley spotted Billie tail-walking in Port River estuary, just north of Adelaide’s city center. “I was out in my red inflatable boat, and suddenly she appeared right beside the boat and did a tail walk circling around it only about 2 meters away,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. He was surprised to see Billie tail walking, he says, but didn’t realize the significance of the behavior at the time—that a cultural trend was emerging among wild bottlenose dolphins in the area.\n\nThat started to sink in as Bossley watched Billie tail walk multiple times over the next few years, and then spotted another wild dolphin, Wave, doing it too. “I became very excited when Wave started to tail walk as well because I then realized what was happening—the behavior was spreading through the dolphin community,” he says. Bossley wanted to document the behavior, so, that same year, he enlisted the help of citizen scientists. More than 30,000 hours of observation later, he and colleagues at WDC described 11 dolphins—six adult females and five juveniles of both sexes—doing the tail walk between 1995 and 2014 (Biol Lett 14:20180314, 2018).\n\nMIKE BOSSLEY\n\nAmong adult dolphins, “it is unclear why only females appear to tail walk, and again, why only some of the local females tail walk,” Bossley says. But the observations provide an example of the impressive imitative skills of dolphins in general. “Dolphins are excellent mimics, both physically and acoustically,” Mann says. The results support this concept and are “also consistent with the general finding that dolphins learn such behaviors when they are young.”\n\nBased on the data, Bossley and his colleagues suggest in the paper that the mimicry illustrated by the spread of tail walking behavior might help researchers understand how wild bottlenose dolphins in the area have learned to adopt a range of foraging behaviors, from beating cuttlefish with their snouts to catching fish in conch shells.\n\nMann, however, says she’s not convinced by this argument because, unlike foraging behavior, the tail walk has no obvious biological function. “The context of tail walking was not reported in the study,” she says. “Was the dolphin alone, in a group? What happened before and after the tail walk?” To be absolutely sure of the function of the behavior, much more context for each occurrence is needed, she says. Perhaps then it could reveal clues about other learned behaviors.\n\nOne possible explanation is that the animals have adopted tail walking as a signal of some sort. “The behavior could be used to show other dolphins that the tail walker is exuberant or capable, which could serve as either a sexual signal or one to improve the group cohesion of the pod,” says Bernd Würsig, a behavioral ecologist who studies whales and dolphins at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston and was not involved in the study. That said, “I do not believe the authors have indications for these [signals] in this case.”\n\nBossley agrees that there’s no evidence in their study that the behavior provides fitness benefits to the animals. “I think the behavior is arbitrary because I am unable to detect any pattern to its performance. It is sometimes done when other dolphins are present, sometimes alone,” he says. “It sometimes [accompanies] a change in behavior, for example from foraging to traveling, and sometimes it does not.”\n\nWhy would wild dolphins learn to do this trick if there’s no biological benefit? “Fun,” Würsig suggests. “Dolphins do quite a bit for enjoyment.”\n\nWhatever the role of tail walking in wild dolphins, it could serve a purpose in guiding conservation decisions. “The behaviour was not produced at high rates until decades after it was originally introduced, showing that anthropogenic impacts on behaviour can last for decades within populations,” Bossley and his colleagues write in the paper. Those anthropogenic impacts have to be taken into consideration when developing conservation strategies, they argue.\n\nNevertheless, this particular behavior is slowly disappearing from the wild population. Billie died in 2009, and according to the team’s observations, tail walking peaked right after that, in 2010 and 2011, with 62 sightings of the behavior each year. Then it tapered off. There were only 7 sightings in 2014—the same year Wave passed away.\n\nThe behavior, it seemed, was a fad. “What surprised me in the story,” Würsig says, “is how very long it took for [tail walking] to manifest, and that it had rather a short life.”&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.103539884,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.10354&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:61,&quot;score&quot;:0.040971663},{&quot;begin&quot;:61,&quot;end&quot;:135,&quot;score&quot;:0.037194733},{&quot;begin&quot;:135,&quot;end&quot;:149,&quot;score&quot;:0.029812546},{&quot;begin&quot;:149,&quot;end&quot;:217,&quot;score&quot;:0.355017},{&quot;begin&quot;:217,&quot;end&quot;:376,&quot;score&quot;:0.36944604},{&quot;begin&quot;:376,&quot;end&quot;:627,&quot;score&quot;:0.01561861},{&quot;begin&quot;:627,&quot;end&quot;:705,&quot;score&quot;:0.020269485},{&quot;begin&quot;:705,&quot;end&quot;:726,&quot;score&quot;:0.23014031},{&quot;begin&quot;:726,&quot;end&quot;:859,&quot;score&quot;:0.028610796},{&quot;begin&quot;:859,&quot;end&quot;:5903,&quot;score&quot;:0.06851897}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 61,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.040971663\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 61,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 135,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.037194733\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 135,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 149,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.029812546\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 149,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 217,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.355017\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 217,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 376,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.36944604\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 376,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 627,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.01561861\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 627,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 705,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.020269485\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 705,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 726,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.23014031\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 726,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 859,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.028610796\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 859,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 5903,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.06851897\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Reading skills, creativity, and insight: exploring the connections.\nStudies of the relationship between creativity and specific reading disabilities have produced inconclusive results. We explored their relationship in a sample of 259 college students (age range: 17 to 38 years-old) from three Chilean universities. The students were tested on their verbal ability, creativity, and insight. A simple linear regression was performed on the complete sample, and on high- and low-achievement groups that were formed based on reading test scores. We observed a significant correlation in the total sample between outcomes on the verbal ability tasks, and on the creativity and insight tasks (range r =. 152 to r =. 356, ps <.001). Scores on the reading comprehension and phonological awareness tasks were the best predictors of performance on creativity and insight tasks (range β = .315 to β = .155, ps <.05). A comparison of the low- and high-scoring groups on verbal ability tasks yielded results to the same effect. These findings do not support the hypothesis that specific reading disability is associated with better performance on creative tasks. Instead, higher verbal ability was found to be associated with higher creativity and insight.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.025005542,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.025006&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:68,&quot;score&quot;:0.007427517},{&quot;begin&quot;:68,&quot;end&quot;:185,&quot;score&quot;:0.024833864},{&quot;begin&quot;:185,&quot;end&quot;:317,&quot;score&quot;:0.0121478075},{&quot;begin&quot;:317,&quot;end&quot;:392,&quot;score&quot;:0.01263372},{&quot;begin&quot;:392,&quot;end&quot;:544,&quot;score&quot;:0.021796638},{&quot;begin&quot;:544,&quot;end&quot;:728,&quot;score&quot;:0.006108612},{&quot;begin&quot;:728,&quot;end&quot;:908,&quot;score&quot;:0.0018395252},{&quot;begin&quot;:908,&quot;end&quot;:1017,&quot;score&quot;:0.04268845},{&quot;begin&quot;:1017,&quot;end&quot;:1152,&quot;score&quot;:0.022074303},{&quot;begin&quot;:1152,&quot;end&quot;:1245,&quot;score&quot;:0.014507953}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 68,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.007427517\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 68,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 185,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.024833864\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 185,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 317,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0121478075\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 317,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 392,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.01263372\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 392,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 544,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.021796638\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 544,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 728,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.006108612\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 728,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 908,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0018395252\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 908,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1017,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.04268845\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1017,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1152,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.022074303\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1152,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1245,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.014507953\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1. Field Of The Invention\nThe present invention relates to windows used in conventional buildings such as houses and particularly to windows that open by pivoting outwardly from their frames.\n2. Description Of The Prior Art And Objectives Of The Invention\nWith the recent increase in the crime rate, in certain populated areas more and more home owners have attempted to secure their dwelling and other buildings from unauthorized intrusions. Various types of security systems and alarms have been have been devised such as shown in the jalousie alarm system of U.S. Pat. No. 4,449,121 whereby a jalousie-type window is connected to an alarm system wherein a deflection of the alarm strut or shaft will cause electrical contact to be made thereby activating an audio alarm. Also, a rotatable saw-bar is included in the alarm strut which will prevent the alarm shaft from being removed or cut by sawing. Other types of securty locks, alarms and devices have been made for a variety of window types. However, such prior art devices usually have certain weakness and problems associated therewith. Also, in recent years changes have been made in building codes for windows to help protect buildings and their contents in adverse weather conditions such as during hurricanes, windstorms and the like.\nWith the aforesaid problems and conditions understood, the present invention was conceived and one of its objectives is to provide an awning window which can be easily installed by a building contractor and which will provide both burglar and weather protection.\nIt is another objective of present invention to provide an awning window which include a rotatable transparent panel with a J-shaped lip which will engage a lip receptacle attached to the frame upon closing.\nIt is yet another objective of the present invention to provide an awning window with an alarm strut having an anti-saw bar and having an alarm switch mechanism therein.\nIt is also an objective of the invention to provide an awning window with an alarm strut with a panel lip receptacle attached thereto.\nIt is also an objective of the present invention to provide an awning window having a window sill with a lip receptacle affixed thereto for engagement with the lowermost panel.\nVarious other objectives and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as the invention set forth in more detail below.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;USPTO Backgrounds\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.014438537,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.014439&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:26,&quot;score&quot;:0.010273575},{&quot;begin&quot;:26,&quot;end&quot;:192,&quot;score&quot;:0.010412407},{&quot;begin&quot;:192,&quot;end&quot;:256,&quot;score&quot;:0.00631686},{&quot;begin&quot;:256,&quot;end&quot;:443,&quot;score&quot;:0.0224908},{&quot;begin&quot;:443,&quot;end&quot;:567,&quot;score&quot;:0.09870692},{&quot;begin&quot;:567,&quot;end&quot;:572,&quot;score&quot;:0.015063282},{&quot;begin&quot;:572,&quot;end&quot;:774,&quot;score&quot;:0.022773718},{&quot;begin&quot;:774,&quot;end&quot;:903,&quot;score&quot;:0.040628307},{&quot;begin&quot;:903,&quot;end&quot;:998,&quot;score&quot;:0.0121478075},{&quot;begin&quot;:998,&quot;end&quot;:2404,&quot;score&quot;:0.027752401}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 26,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010273575\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 26,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 192,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010412407\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 192,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 256,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.00631686\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 256,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 443,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0224908\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 443,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 567,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.09870692\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 567,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 572,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.015063282\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 572,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 774,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.022773718\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 774,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 903,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.040628307\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 903,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 998,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0121478075\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 998,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 2404,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.027752401\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Philip's Story\n\n\&quot;I remember going to school every day on the bus to St Austell from Truro and being fascinated by all the different houses built along the way. Looking back, that first interest in architecture was where it all began for me and when I left school nearly 50 years ago I resolved to become a surveyor. That goal was ultimately achieved and although now qualified as a Chartered Surveyor for many years I am best known as an estate agent having worked in the industry for 48 years.\n\nHaving spent the first 5 years in Launceston and Liskeard I returned to my home city of Truro and became property manager for a well known agricultural firm for the next 10 years. With Truro dominated by corporate agents I decided to open my own agency and took over premises in Cathedral Lane where my great grandfather had started business in 1876. I was local, a Cornishman, fiercely proud of both Truro and maintaining the Cornish identity and passionate about “planning” and the built environment. Many businesses have come and gone but 30 years later I am still here.\n\nAgents are much maligned and in many respects they have been largely responsible for the bad reputation that exists. As a firm we have tried to maintain and portray a very professional ideology and meant in its true form being governed in all our day to day dealings by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. We are certainly less vocal than many other agents on what we have achieved over the years but the reality is we have achieved more than most and we continue to strive. I have always believed that recommendation is your best form of instruction and never take anyone for granted. It is said that, in business, loyalty is a diminishing quality with the general public and whilst sometimes bitterly disappointed by clients actions you can also be boosted by a clients complete trust and moral ethics.\n\nNowadays I am joined by 3 partners (all remarkably with a similar Cornish background) and with a total workforce of 16 I am proud that the ethos of the firm remains exactly the same. We are here to be of service, maintain professional standards but be understanding of your clients needs and do your best. With technology the world is constantly changing but there is still a real need for property professionals and Philip Martin will be here for many years to come.\n\nHaving sold and managed property from the banks of the Tamar to the tip of St. Just in Penwith we have an intimate knowledge of the county. Indeed WE KNOW CORNWALL, WE KNOW PROPERTY AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.052136723,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.052137&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:15,&quot;score&quot;:0.0070457286},{&quot;begin&quot;:15,&quot;end&quot;:160,&quot;score&quot;:0.02809576},{&quot;begin&quot;:160,&quot;end&quot;:316,&quot;score&quot;:0.012217224},{&quot;begin&quot;:316,&quot;end&quot;:495,&quot;score&quot;:0.0071151447},{&quot;begin&quot;:495,&quot;end&quot;:676,&quot;score&quot;:0.013536129},{&quot;begin&quot;:676,&quot;end&quot;:847,&quot;score&quot;:0.040628307},{&quot;begin&quot;:847,&quot;end&quot;:999,&quot;score&quot;:0.022213135},{&quot;begin&quot;:999,&quot;end&quot;:1070,&quot;score&quot;:0.010273575},{&quot;begin&quot;:1070,&quot;end&quot;:1188,&quot;score&quot;:0.2712817},{&quot;begin&quot;:1188,&quot;end&quot;:2562,&quot;score&quot;:0.056931525}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 15,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0070457286\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 15,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 160,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.02809576\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 160,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 316,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012217224\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 316,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 495,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0071151447\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 495,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 676,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013536129\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 676,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 847,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.040628307\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 847,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 999,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.022213135\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 999,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1070,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010273575\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1070,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1188,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.2712817\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1188,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 2562,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.056931525\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q:\n\nWrite group labels in first bar or above instead of legend\n\nI have a stacked barplot with the following data\ndf <- expand.grid(name = c(\&quot;oak\&quot;,\&quot;birch\&quot;,\&quot;cedar\&quot;),\n    sample = c(\&quot;one\&quot;,\&quot;two\&quot;),\n    type = c(\&quot;sapling\&quot;,\&quot;adult\&quot;,\&quot;dead\&quot;))\ndf$count <- sample(5:200, size = nrow(df), replace = T)\n\nI generate a barplot and try to add the group lables to it:\nggplot(df, aes(x = name, y = count, fill = type)) +\n   geom_bar(stat = \&quot;identity\&quot;) +\n   coord_flip() +\n   theme(legend.position=\&quot;none\&quot;) +\n   geom_text(aes(label = type, position = \&quot;stack\&quot;)) \n\nIt produces:\n\nTwo to three questions arise:\n\nHow can I make the labels appear in the top bar only?\nHow can I make the labels appear in the center of the bar section?\nOptionally: How can I make the labels appear on top of the top bar being connected to their sections by arrows?\n\nA:\n\nThere is a link suggested above.

denied entry to PRYSM Nightclub for wearing a dress, Graber said. View Full Caption Courtesy Jay Graber and Yelp/PRYSM\n\nCHICAGO — A Lincoln Park nightclub denied entry to a trans person who was wearing a dress, the person said.\n\nJay Graber, who identifies as transgender and uses the pronouns \&quot;they\&quot; and \&quot;them,\&quot; said they were turned away because they wore a dress while trying to get into PRYSM, 1543 N. Kingsbury Ave., on Dec. 30.\n\nRepresentatives of the club did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nGraber paid $40 for tickets in advance and went to the club with a friend named Lux on Dec. 30, they said. Once there, Graber said an employee told them the two couldn't enter because Graber was wearing a dress.\n\nWhen Graber said that was discrimination, the employee instead said Graber couldn't enter because they were wearing sneakers instead of dress shoes, Graber said. The employee told Graber they could enter if they returned with dress shoes, Graber said.\n\nGraber and Lux went back to an apartment and Graber changed into dress shoes. They returned to the club and the first employee scanned the pair's tickets — marking Graber's as \&quot;male\&quot; — and motioned them toward the club entrance, Graber said.\n\nBut that's when another employee, a door manager, stopped the two, Graber said.\n\nThat employee \&quot;told us 'there was no way in h--- he would be letting a dude in a dress into his nightclub,'\&quot; Graber said. The employee also said Graber \&quot;didn't fit the dress code,\&quot; Graber said.\n\nGraber and Lux said they wanted to speak to a supervisor about ticket refunds, but were \&quot;laughed at, misgendered and ridiculed\&quot; by the employees, Graber said.\n\nA supervisor eventually spoke with the door manager, Graber said, and Graber held up a receipt and showed the supervisor the dress. The supervisor \&quot;made a disgusted face,\&quot; nodded his head no and went into the club, Graber said.\n\nAt the same time, several men and women — including women wearing dresses — were let into the club, some of them for free, Graber said.\n\nGraber asked the employees what was needed to wear to get into the club and explained they had paid for the tickets, several rides between home and the club and they wanted to see the artist who was performing, Graber said. The employees laughed and ignored Graber and Lux, Graber said.\n\nAfter waiting outside for 45 minutes, the employee who had scanned Graber's ticket approached and said he wished he could have let Graber and Lux in but that \&quot;he had been told that we would not be let in no matter what I was wearing,\&quot; Graber said. The employee then asked Graber and Lux to leave.\n\nAs Graber left, they saw a person named Jazmine, who is agender and also uses \&quot;they\&quot; and \&quot;them\&quot; pronouns. Graber, Lux and Jazmine spoke and left to go to a LGBTQ-friendly club in Lakeview.\n\nJazmine, who has shaved, green hair, said entry was denied because of Jazmine's \&quot;general look.\&quot; An employee said Jazmine's pants were joggers — a loose type of pants usually worn for exercise — and were not allowed, though Jazmine was not wearing joggers.\n\nA friend had been trying to convince bouncers to let Jazmine into the club, Jazmine said, but once Jazmine spoke with Graber and Lux the employees \&quot;weren't having it.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;I have never had any issues until last weekend\&quot; getting into clubs, Jazmine said.\n\nGraber posted about the incident on PRYSM's Facebook several times and messaged the club, but the organization has not responded except to ask for Graber's contact information several days ago, Graber said.\n\nOthers have shared Graber's posts and have written posts of their own on PRYSM's Facebook page, criticizing the club. The organization has not publicly responded to them.\n\nJazmine contacted the performer the three had been trying to see, a French artist named Madeon, on social media. The performer apologized and said he would try to ensure the three received refunds and free tickets to his next show in Chicago.\n\nBrian Johnson, CEO of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Illinois, said being denied entry to a public accommodation because of one's perceived gender identity \&quot;seems like a pretty blatant violation of the Chicago and the Illinois human rights ordinances.\&quot;\n\nEquality Illinois would encourage anyone with a claim of discrimination to contact the Chicago Human Relations Commission if the incident happens in the city, Johnson said.\n\nKen Gunn, deputy commissioner of the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, said victims of possible discrimination have 180 days to file a complaint with the commission. Once a complaint is filed, the commission will investigate the case and, if there is \&quot;substantial evidence of discrimination,\&quot; the case goes to a hearing.\n\nIf the complainant prevails, the business that discriminated against the complainant can face a fine up to $1,000, Gunn said. The complainant can also go to court to receive damages.\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.2712817,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.271282&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:113,&quot;score&quot;:0.016937515},{&quot;begin&quot;:113,&quot;end&quot;:166,&quot;score&quot;:0.01228664},{&quot;begin&quot;:166,&quot;end&quot;:275,&quot;score&quot;:0.055333257},{&quot;begin&quot;:275,&quot;end&quot;:452,&quot;score&quot;:0.10763696},{&quot;begin&quot;:452,&quot;end&quot;:476,&quot;score&quot;:0.008746422},{&quot;begin&quot;:476,&quot;end&quot;:481,&quot;score&quot;:0.010481823},{&quot;begin&quot;:481,&quot;end&quot;:559,&quot;score&quot;:0.013883209},{&quot;begin&quot;:559,&quot;end&quot;:667,&quot;score&quot;:0.028782474},{&quot;begin&quot;:667,&quot;end&quot;:772,&quot;score&quot;:0.017909339},{&quot;begin&quot;:772,&quot;end&quot;:4976,&quot;score&quot;:0.13655609}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 113,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.016937515\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 113,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 166,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.01228664\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 166,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 275,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.055333257\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 275,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 452,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.10763696\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 452,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 476,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008746422\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 476,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 481,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010481823\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 481,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 559,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013883209\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 559,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 667,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.028782474\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 667,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 772,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.017909339\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 772,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 4976,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.13655609\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ENERGIE RENOUVELABLE Au bord du canal de l’Ourcq, des dalles photovoltaïques éclairent la piste cyclable qui passe, non loin de là, sous un pont. L’expérimentation rappelle la route solaire inaugurée en grande pompe en Normandie en décembre 2016. Or, elle a mal vieilli\n\nL'énergie produite par les dalles photovoltaïques permettent d’éclairer, en journée, la portion de piste cyclable qui passe sous un pont, à quelques mètres de là. — F.Pouliquen/20Minutes\n\nDepuis janvier, le long du canal de l’Ourcq, 56 m² de dalles photovoltaïques posées sur la piste cyclable produisent l’énergie qui va permettre d’éclairer le passage sous un pont non loin de là. Et quand il y a du surplus, il est vendu et réinjecté dans le réseau.\n\nLa technologique est développée par Wattway, filiale du groupe Colas, déjà derrière la route solaire inaugurée dans l’Orne en décembre 2016. Près de trois ans plus tard, l’expérimentation rencontre des difficultés, de l’aveu même de Wattway.\n\nL’entreprise n’abandonne pas pour autant cette idée de produire de l’énergie à même la route, mais privilégie désormais les projets de plus petites échelles comme celui de Bobigny. Une bonne idée ?\n\nUne piste cyclable pour favoriser la mobilité douce… et pourquoi pas aussi pour produire de l’énergie ? C’est en tout cas l’idée creusée à Bobigny (Seine-Saint-Denis). Le long du canal de l’Ourcq, la première piste cycliste solaire a été mise en service en janvier dernier et a été inaugurée ce lundi par le département de Seine-Saint-Denis.\n\nLe tronçon n’est pas bien grand. Les dalles photovoltaïques sont alignées sur 27 mètres de long et couvrent une surface totale de 56 mètres carrés. Pas de quoi couvrir toute la largeur du chemin de halage, si bien que bon nombre de cyclistes passent à côté des dalles, sans sembler les remarquer.\n\nÉclairer sous un pont… et pourquoi pas plus ?\n\nIl n’empêche, cette piste solaire cyclable s’acquitte de sa tâche. En sortie de piste, un panneau affiche en instantanée les performances des dalles photovoltaïques. Dont celui de la production d’énergie cumulée depuis sa mise en service, en janvier dernier. Soit 2.996 kilowatts/heure, l’équivalent de 440 jours de consommation d’électricité (hors chauffage) d’un foyer.\n\nEn sortie de piste, un panneau affiche en instantanée les performances des dalles photovoltaïques. - F.Pouliquen/20Minutes\n\nCette énergie permet d’éclairer en journée la portion de piste cyclable qui passe sous le pont à quelques mètres de là. « C’était une demande régulière que nous remontaient les cyclistes, raconte Stéphane Troussel, le président du conseil départemental de Seine-Saint-Denis. Cette partie était très sombre et créait des contrastes importants au point d’éblouir les cyclistes. » Voilà pour la mission prioritaire des dalles photovoltaïques. « Le surplus d’énergie alimente également une batterie qui permet d’éclairer sous ce même pont la nuit, poursuit Etienne Gaudin, directeur de Wattway, filiale de l’entreprise Colas (groupe Bouygues) qui développe cette technologie. Quand cette batterie est pleine et qu’il y a encore du surplus – ce qui est souvent arrivé cet été –, il est vendu à Enedis et réinjecté dans le réseau Enedis. »\n\nDans la lignée de la route solaire en Normandie\n\nQu’on ne se trompe pas pour autant : cette piste cycliste solaire, qui a nécessité un investissement de 118.000 euros, coûte plus cher qu’elle ne rapporte au département. « L’enjeu n’est pas là, glisse Stéphane Troussel. Dans un territoire très urbanisé comme le nôtre, il y a des solutions plus simples pour éclairer un pont. Mais c’était le terrain idéal pour une telle démonstration et l’occasion de montrer notre attachement au développement des énergies renouvelables. »\n\nEn ce lancement de la semaine européenne de la #mobilité j’ai pu présenter la 1ère piste cyclable solaire d’IDF sur le canal de l’Ourcq à Bobigny 🚲 Un dispositif innovant de @WattwaybyColas, symbole de l’engagement du Département en faveur de mobilités plus douces &amp; #durables ♻️ pic.twitter.com/kVjOfxCj5t — Stéphane Troussel (@StephanTroussel) September 16, 2019\n\nCette expérimentation n’est pas sans rappeler la première route solaire au monde inaugurée en grande pompe en décembre 2016, en Normandie. Et derrière laquelle on retrouve déjà Wattway. L’installation pilote alignait quelque 2.800 m² de panneaux photovoltaïques sur un kilomètre d’une route départementale à Tourouvre-au-Perche (Orne). Wattaway affichait l’ambition de fournir l’équivalent de la consommation annuelle de l’éclairage public d’une ville de 5.000 habitants. Et Ségolène Royal, alors ministre de l’Environnement, celle de déployer 1.000 km de ces panneaux solaires sur route d’ici à cinq ans.\n\n« Pas un fiasco » pour Wattway\n\nMais deux ans et demi plus tard, cette route solaire normande fait pâle figure. Le Monde, dans un article paru le 22 juillet, évoque sans détour un « fiasco », « ni efficace énergétiquement, ni rentable économiquement ». Le quotidien évoque aussi des joins en lambeaux, des panneaux solaires qui se décollent de la chaussée, des éclats qui émaillent la résine protégeant les cellules photovoltaïques ou encore une portion d’une centaine de mètres trop abîmée pour être réparée. A cela s’ajoute le bruit des véhicules sur ce revêtement dont se plaignent les riverains.\n\nEtienne Gaudin ne nie pas les difficultés rencontrées dans l’Orne, mais récuse le terme « fiasco ». « C’est une première expérience qui continue, commence-t-il. Il n’est plus significatif, aujourd’hui, en termes de production d’énergie, notamment parce que les dalles photovoltaïques sont anciennes. Elles datent de 2016, alors que nous avons beaucoup évolué depuis. Nous sommes en discussions avec le département de l’Orne pour les remplacer. Quoi qu’il en soit, ce premier site nous a aussi permis déjà d’expérimenter un grand nombre de technologies. C’est grâce à lui que nous sommes aujourd’hui en mesure de faire une piste cyclable solaire à Bobigny. »\n\nLa priorité donnée à de plus petits projets\n\nIl n’empêche, Wattway évoque désormais ces routes solaires « comme des projets à mener sur le long terme » et privilégie en attendant des réalisations à plus petites échelles. « Nous avons aujourd’hui 45 expérimentations en cours dans le monde », précise Etienne Gaudin. Elles sont de deux types. « Les premières visent à permettre à des bâtiments [école, mairie, supermarché] d’être à énergie positive [qui produit plus d’énergie qu’il en consomme], reprend le directeur de Wattway. Nos dalles photovoltaïques sont par exemple installées sur les allées piétonnes aux abords des bâtiments et complètent très souvent des premières installations de panneaux photovoltaïques sur les toits. »\n\nLa deuxième configuration est celle, donc, de la piste cyclable solaire de Bobigny. « Sur ces installations, l’objectif est d’alimenter en énergie des équipements à proximité, reprend Etienne Gaudin. Cela peut être de l’éclairage public à Bobigny, mais aussi une caméra de surveillance du trafic au milieu d’un rond-point à Montpellier, ou des bornes de recharges pour véhicules électriques… »\n\nCes dalles photovoltaïques ne sont pas toujours la solution la plus pertinente. Elles ont notamment un rendement moindre que les panneaux photovoltaïques installés sur les toits ou en façade des bâtiments, que l’on peut incliner de façon optimale pour capter les rayons du soleil. « En revanche, lorsque le point de raccordement au réseau est éloigné de l’équipement que l’on veut éclairer ou lorsque le risque que les panneaux photovoltaïques soient vandalisés, notre solution a sa carte à jouer », estime Etienne Gaudin.\n\n« Un gadget »\n\nMarc Jedliczka n’est pas convaincu. Le vice-président du Réseau pour la transition énergétique (Cler) a du mal à voir dans ces dalles photovoltaïques installées au sol autre chose que « des gadgets » pour lesquels « on jette de l’argent public par les fenêtres ». « Un panneau photovoltaïque produit quand il est au soleil, lance-t-il. Si des voitures et des vélos passent dessus et génèrent de l’ombre, ça marche nettement moins. »\n\nSurtout, pour lui la priorité est bien plus « de permettre le développement des solutions éprouvées, plus simples et aux rendements meilleurs ». Marc Jedliczka évoque notamment les installations de panneaux photovoltaïques sur les toits et façades des bâtiments. « En France, il y a d’un côté les petits projets, ceux des particuliers qui équipent leur maison, et de l’autre les grands parcs au sol que développent les énergéticiens, résume-t-il. Entre les deux, au niveau des écoles, des mairies, des immeubles de bureaux, des ombrières de parking, il y a encore trop peu de projets menés, notamment parce qu’il n’y a de tarifs d’achats [un prix d’achat garanti] que pour les projets inférieurs à 100 kWc [kilowatt crête, la puissance de votre installation photovoltaïque]. C’est trop bas. Nous demandons qu’ils soient étendus jusqu’à 500 kWc. »&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.089577995,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.089578&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:146,&quot;score&quot;:0.006004488},{&quot;begin&quot;:146,&quot;end&quot;:247,&quot;score&quot;:0.0012408118},{&quot;begin&quot;:247,&quot;end&quot;:270,&quot;score&quot;:0.15276173},{&quot;begin&quot;:270,&quot;end&quot;:458,&quot;score&quot;:0.017423427},{&quot;begin&quot;:458,&quot;end&quot;:654,&quot;score&quot;:0.006525108},{&quot;begin&quot;:654,&quot;end&quot;:724,&quot;score&quot;:0.043375164},{&quot;begin&quot;:724,&quot;end&quot;:866,&quot;score&quot;:0.0033319702},{&quot;begin&quot;:866,&quot;end&quot;:967,&quot;score&quot;:0.0068721883},{&quot;begin&quot;:967,&quot;end&quot;:1149,&quot;score&quot;:0.00860759},{&quot;begin&quot;:1149,&quot;end&quot;:8896,&quot;score&quot;:0.021518974}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 146,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.006004488\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 146,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 247,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0012408118\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 247,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 270,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.15276173\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 270,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 458,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.017423427\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 458,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 654,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.006525108\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 654,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 724,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.043375164\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 724,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 866,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0033319702\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 866,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 967,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0068721883\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 967,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1149,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.00860759\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1149,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 8896,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.021518974\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[Function of CDK12 in Tumor initiation and progression and its clinical consequences].\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) participate in many cellular processes and play a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle and transcription processes. Recently, CDK12 was identified as a key factor orchestrating transcription of genes, such as BRCA1, ATM, ATR, FANCI and FANCD2, which are involved in the DNA-damage response pathway. Importantly, inhibition of function of these genes commonly leads to induction of genomic instability followed by cancer development, but the precise contribution of CDK12 to these processes is to be unveiled. Nevertheless, several mutations affecting function of CDK12 were already identified in a variety of tumors of different origin (ovary, breast, prostate, intestine) making tumors sensitive to cytostatics promot-ing DNA damage (platin derivatives, alkylating regimens) and inhibitors of DNA repair (PARP inhibitors). Such an effect has been already observed in the model of high grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Thus, CDK12 is becoming a potential therapeutic target of drugs causing synthetic lethality in these cells. Our review summarizes most recent information about CDK12 function in cancer and discusses potential use of CDK12 in clinics.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.00930175,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.009302&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:87,&quot;score&quot;:0.0039914227},{&quot;begin&quot;:87,&quot;end&quot;:243,&quot;score&quot;:0.005830948},{&quot;begin&quot;:243,&quot;end&quot;:426,&quot;score&quot;:0.021380141},{&quot;begin&quot;:426,&quot;end&quot;:636,&quot;score&quot;:0.0224908},{&quot;begin&quot;:636,&quot;end&quot;:951,&quot;score&quot;:0.015549194},{&quot;begin&quot;:951,&quot;end&quot;:1046,&quot;score&quot;:0.036336336},{&quot;begin&quot;:1046,&quot;end&quot;:1154,&quot;score&quot;:0.029640866},{&quot;begin&quot;:1154,&quot;end&quot;:1279,&quot;score&quot;:0.006559816}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 87,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0039914227\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 87,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 243,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.005830948\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 243,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 426,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.021380141\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 426,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 636,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0224908\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 636,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 951,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.015549194\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 951,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1046,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.036336336\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1046,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1154,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.029640866\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1154,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1279,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.006559816\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ts &amp; Cs:\n\nAll events are subject to change or cancellation at short notice, any changes to the event will be notified by social media.\n\nPlease check fopp.com or @foppofficial on Twitter or Facebook for any event updates or changes before travelling.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;OpenWebText2\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.009648831,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.009649&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:9,&quot;score&quot;:0.009093502},{&quot;begin&quot;:9,&quot;end&quot;:135,&quot;score&quot;:0.0168681},{&quot;begin&quot;:135,&quot;end&quot;:249,&quot;score&quot;:0.03461955}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 9,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009093502\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 9,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 135,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0168681\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 135,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 249,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.03461955\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Information is provided exclusively for consumers' personal, non-commercial use and may not be used for any purpose other than to identify prospective properties consumers may be interested in purchasing.

For notational simplicity, let's have n be the length of the input array and U be the largest number in the array. The runtime of MSD radix sort is then O(n log U), since the number of digits in the number U is O(log U). O(log U) is a very, very slowly-growing function. For reference, the number of atoms in the universe is about 1080, which is about 2240. Therefore, if you're sorting numbers that were generated by any physical process, the recursion depth will be at most 240, which while large is definitely manageable.\nIf you're sorting really large numbers - say, numbers with thousands and thousands of bits - then you're right to be worried about blowing out the stack. However, I'd argue that it's extremely unlikely that this would happen if you have a good implementation of MSD radix sort. There's a standard optimization in quicksort - which looks a lot like MSD radix sort - where instead of making two branching recursive calls, you make one recursive call on the smaller of the two ranges to sort, then recycle the stack frame from the initial call to sort the larger range. (This is essentially a tail-call elimination). Now, suppose you apply this to MSD radix sort. Since every newly-created stack frame works on the smaller of the two ranges to sort, you can guarantee that each new stack frame has half as many elements in it than the previous stack frame. As a result, the maximum depth that the stack can reach is O(log n) - not O(log U). In order for this to blow out your stack, you'd need a truly astronomically large input array, regardless of the stack size.\nIn summary: you're right, the algorithm is not in place. However, due to the fact that the stack depth is O(log U) in a naive implementation and O(log n) in an optimized implementation, you shouldn't need to worry about this unless you had a naive implementation and truly colossally huge inputs.\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.02792408,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.027924&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:65,&quot;score&quot;:0.010481823},{&quot;begin&quot;:65,&quot;end&quot;:127,&quot;score&quot;:0.024833864},{&quot;begin&quot;:127,&quot;end&quot;:234,&quot;score&quot;:0.014993866},{&quot;begin&quot;:234,&quot;end&quot;:384,&quot;score&quot;:0.027580723},{&quot;begin&quot;:384,&quot;end&quot;:533,&quot;score&quot;:0.021380141},{&quot;begin&quot;:533,&quot;end&quot;:599,&quot;score&quot;:0.02637897},{&quot;begin&quot;:599,&quot;end&quot;:604,&quot;score&quot;:0.019297661},{&quot;begin&quot;:604,&quot;end&quot;:774,&quot;score&quot;:0.04165838},{&quot;begin&quot;:774,&quot;end&quot;:980,&quot;score&quot;:0.01999182},{&quot;begin&quot;:980,&quot;end&quot;:2990,&quot;score&quot;:0.018187003}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.010481823\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 127,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.024833864\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 127,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 234,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.014993866\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 234,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 384,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.027580723\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 384,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 533,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.021380141\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 533,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 599,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.02637897\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 599,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 604,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.019297661\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 604,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 774,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.04165838\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 774,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 980,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.01999182\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 980,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 2990,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.018187003\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Posted!\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nComments\n\nWelcome to our new and improved comments, which are for subscribers only.\nThis is a test to see whether we can improve the experience for you.\nYou do not need a Facebook profile to participate.\n\nYou will need to register before adding a comment.\nTyped comments will be lost if you are not logged in.\n\nPlease be polite.\nIt's OK to disagree with someone's ideas, but personal attacks, insults, threats, hate speech, advocating violence and other violations can result in a ban.\nIf you see comments in violation of our community guidelines, please report them.\n\nJalan-Jalan and LeQuire Gallery’s Art &amp; Antiques holiday event\n\nLeQuire Gallery and Jalan-Jalan Antiques have teamed up to host a unique holiday exhibition and shopping experience 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday.

This is a little test, just to see who reads and who shares without reading!\n\nThese posts are like nails on a blackboard to me. There are a couple reasons. First, they misunderstand how the newsfeed works. Not all your friends see all your posts. So you can’t judge people by whether they respond—you can’t tell if they’ve seen it at all. Second, although the wording of each version of this sort of post varies, in most cases it implies “I read carefully. Some of you, though, are not being careful.” Can’t posters of this meme feel the smugness of the tone? It implies, “If you don’t read my long, wordy Facebook post all the way to the end, then you are a thoughtless and careless person.” Is that what you really meant to say? Third, the writer is imposing an obligation on his/her readers. Kurt Luther comments, “People’s timeless desire to impose chain letter-like obligations on others has made a smooth transition to the new medium.” Public Service Announcement: Please don’t post this meme.\n\nI think that I understand the better impulse behind the meme. The poster is saying, “I have doubts about whether the connections we are forging on this website are meaningful. I am yearning for a deeper sense of connectedness to people I care about.” I like that impulse. So here’s my challenge: How can we express that desire for more meaningful connections without this obnoxious meme? If you have ideas, leave me a comment!

This is the second PV preview we've gotten and the second time the fan's reactions have been split. Of course the reactions are split for all PVs. Opinions differ, personal preferences are taken into consideration, and quite honestly you can't please everyone. Despite, how hard you try some fans will always be disappointed by a PV due to their own high expectations. But, when I saw the PV previews for Maji Desu ka Ska I was impressed. I was honestly impressed. The song is upbeat, the dance is simple but high energy and cute, the outfits are vibrant, vivid, and cute. But I still found that a lot of Morning Musume fans still thought the PV was terrible. Because it follows the same formula that Morning Musume PVs have followed lately.\n\nBut then I started to think, why do fans hate this formula so much? Do they not realize this is how Morning Musume has always made their PVs? If they haven't, were they following the same group as I was? Morning Musume is my absolute favorite idol group. I follow them the closest, and I critic them the closest. When I dislike something they are doing I strongly voice my opinion about it. But it seems fans are negatively voicing their opinions just to voice their opinion. If you go back and watch all of Morning Musume's PVs they all follow the same formula. Close-up shot, dance shot, and then random scenes of the girls when no one is singing, which is usually a mixture of close-ups or full body shots.\n\nMorning Musume has hardly ever made a PV with an actual story line, or something else going on besides this formula. I can literally only name a handful of Morning Musume PVs that aren't like this. And those PV are: Aruiteru, The Peace, Namida Tomaranai Houkago, Roman My Dear Boy, I Wish, Morning Musume no Hyokkori Hyoutan-jima, Do It! Now, Mr. Moonligh ~Ai no Big Band~, and Koko ni Iruzee.\n\nYou could also argue that Egao Yes Nude, Go Girl ~Koi no Victory~, Naichau Kamo, Souda! We're Alive, and Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii jan count as well. But I don't count rolling in a bed, saying suki up-close, crying up close, jumping in heigh, or breaking fake glass as a story line.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people reading this find that hard to believe. Since a lot of fans are waiting for them to make interesting PVs again. But all of their PVs have been the same. Even if you're consciously unaware of that fact. But make no mistake, Morning Musume follows that formula and so do most idol groups. And when I say you might not be consciously aware of this, I mean because directors have tricks to make a seemingly boring/low budget PV look more exciting or entertaining.\n\nNow, that might be them having their close-ups in a more exciting setting then the rest of the PV.\n\nShowing more shots of the setting/having them look like they are doing something. That eludes to a storyline without actually establishing one.\n\nHave more than one shot of the dance. Seeing the same dance in different outfits adds the illusion that you're seeing something new, even though you're not.\n\nHave them do something more interesting during their close-ups. Just because they are spinning and not standing doesn't make it less of just another close-up.\n\nHave them wear more than one outfit, having another outfit makes the PV more dynamic. It also makes it look like it has a high budget and fans will often over look the lack of a storyline if there is more than one outfit.\n\nNow, all of this might have been visually appealing and exciting but that doesn't make it a storyline. A storyline has dialogue that lets you know what's going on in it. Or it silently follows a storyline. Like falling in love, going to the beach, committing suicide, or just about anything really. Something that actually tells you a story while you watch it. Apparently Morning Musume fans want of all of Momusu's PVs to be Michael Jackson's Thriller video. But aside from AKB48, most idols aren't making PVs like this. Name the last idol PV you actually saw that had a storyline. I mean like the ones you see in American music videos. I honestly can't think of any. Within or outside of H!P.\n\nThen if the storyline isn't a problem, what is? If you take the storyline out of a PV you're left only with the other pieces. Which are the dance shots and close-ups. Which are the PVs that JE and some 48 groups and subgroups are making, as well as lesser know idol groups. But I hardly ever see any of those fans complain. And I have to wonder if it's because the fans like that formula, or is it that these groups are so popular and on top of their genres (male and female idols separately of course) that they have nothing to complain about? I'm going to go with the second one.\n\nHere are some idol PVs that are the same caliber as Morning Musume's PVs.\n\nKAT-TUN-Ultimate Wheels\n\nHey! Say! JUMP-Arigatou Sekai no Doko ni itemo\n\nSDN48-GAGAGA\n\nIdoling!!!-Eve\n\nCanary Club-Daisukki\n\nNot Yet-Shuumatsu Not Yet\n\nAKB48-Chance no Junban\n\nAnd of course there are plenty more. But these are just the ones I could think of on the top of my head because they are recent.\n\nBut despite all this, it always seems like Morning Musume are judged more harshly. That Morning Musume is the only group making bad PVs. I don't understand the bias between fans. And I don't understand how harshly PVs are judged. I understand that sometimes a PV is so awful you have to complain. But every single Momusu PV gets judged harshly. No matter how much better it is than a previous PV or how similar other idol PVs are. It makes absolutely no sense to me. I might like H!P and JE the most but when their PVs suck I'm the first one to say it. And when their PVs don't suck I'm there praising it. These are idol PVs, and to expect them to be a masterpiece is ridiculous.\n\nIt seems like fans are also judging Momusu too harshy is because they have been around for a long time and are dwindling a bit. And hating on them is the cool thing to do in the idol fandom. But what about Arashi? They hardly ever release interesting PVs or ones that break the standard formula. But they have been around nearly as long as Momusu and sell significantly higher than them. And yet rabid Arashi fangirls hardly complain about anything they do.\n\nI don't know, this is basically just a rant. And I'm sure I'll get a lot of comments telling me I don't know what I'm talking about. Or that they are an unbiased fan, so that in some way means all fans are unbiased. I think I might actually be one of the few truly unbiased fans out there. And I know that sounds extremely arrogant, but sometimes it does feel that way. I just really wanted to get all of this off of my chest. So, what does everyone think? Thoughts, opinions, disagreements. I'd love to hear other fan's inputs.\n\n11\ncomments:\n\nFrom what I observed, I think only fans outside of Japan are unhappy about the PV. The wotas are not complaining about the PV, it's the costumes the girls are wearing that they're having trouble with. LOL\n\nI wasn't impressed that much with Chance no Junban or Not Yet's PVs either. I don't Kat-Tun's PV was close to Morning Musume's PV; they used some really cool editing. Now for me, I critique when I am just not impressed/ when I am bored. I'm not checking things off and I've even mentioned how impressed I've been with Momoclo's PVs considering how low budget, but fun they are.\n\nI just like it when they are visually appealing and make me like the song more. Like: Nanchatte Ren'ai and Shou ga nai Yume Oibito. More outfits, interesting angles and camera shots, nice backdrops. If I like the song more after watching the PV then I like it. My main problem lately is that it is obviously formulated, which means they probably are doing a poor job because I am noticing that. (Arashi's Lotus uses that formula but I don't think about it while watching it.) The outfits and backgrounds have also been hit or miss for me. Plus, I might be subconsciously comparing AKB's and MM's PVs, and AKB's PVs have been really impressive lately.\n\nI totally understand what you mean. Who else would not compare if there other good quality PVs out there. However, I do not think UFA gave Musume enough attention to allocate more budget to the production of the PVs. I can recall a few Kpop PV that are so much better quality and obviously have a better budget.\n\nSo rather to say it's formulated, I'm assuming that this is just the best the creative team can do for Musume with what little that they were allocated for. (^q^)\n\n@Ryo: That's usually how it is. Foreign fans seem to make a big deal over things that Japanese fans don't even think twice about.Am I the only one who loves the outfits? They are like Naichau Kamo mixed with Maji Bomber. I love them! XD\n\nI also understand about comparing if there are other good PVs out there, but for the most part idol PV are pretty much exactly the same. That's why I posted so many examples from different agencies. Hardly any other idols are making better PVs but it seems like Momusu is always judged the harshest.\n\nTheir are several reasons why Kpop PVs are better than Jpop PVs. But that's neither here nor there.\n\nThat might be true to an extent, but I think it's more beyond that. Other H!P fans said C-ute's Aitai Lonely Christmas and Dance de Bakoon, and Berryz Koubou's Heroine ni Narou Ka were amazing PVs. But they were nearly the same format as Momusu's were. For some reason Momusu is just judged the most.\n\n@Mina: I wasn't that impressed with Chance no Junban or Ultimate Wheels, but I LOVED Shuumatsu Not Yet. Yes, it was simple but I thought it was energetic and fun. Much how I feel about Maji Desu ka Ska.That's when I critique also. But it seems a lot of fans are just way too harsh about Momusu for no reason. I agree on that. Momoiro Clover's PVs are usually amazing. But that's because they follow a storyline.\n\nBut more outfits and different angles don't really add anything to the PV, and are just are the same formula. That's what I was trying to say in my post. No matter how much camera effects a PV has it's still following the formula most fans claim to hate.I also think that, that makes a PV more dynamic and interesting. But most fans still complain. But if they are complaining about that, and Morning Musume has ALWAYS made PVs like that, I don't understand what they want or are expecting from PVs.I think they've always been obviously formated. I think it's impossible to not notice that they were. Watching Lotus you completely notice that formula. I mean it's basically the Monster PV in different outfits and backdrop. Arashi's PVs are worse then Momusu's. Lately their PVs have just been them standing. Like in Dear Snow, Hatenai Sora, and To Be Free. Yet, hardly anyone complains. Arashi fans are really intense. XD\n\nThe outfits and backgrounds are always a hit or miss for me too. Like in Onna to Otoko no Lullaby Game. I hated the outfits, but I still kinda liked the PV. I don't really compare PVs unless they are weraing similar outfits, are doing similar effects, or have a similar backdrop. Beyond that I don't compare. AKB48's PVs have always been really impressive. They make the best idol PVs out there, in my opinion. They always have a storyline and are always fun to watch. I also really like Watarirouka Hashiritai's PVs. Valentine Kiss is one of my favorite PVs of the last couple of months. It's really adorable.\n\nThe main problem lies with us foreign fans as the people above have said. I think we are so used to seeing the high budget videos from American or world renown artists that we somehow expect that from MM as well. I think that a lot of MM fans somehow regard the group as being above the rest of the idols and therefore don't understand why their videos don't stand out from the crowd. I think everyone's waiting for some sort of shocking Lady Gaga moment from MM. They'll just have to make do with Berryz Gaga themed pv instead. lol.\n\nThat's definitely a main factor as well. I don't think foreign fans realize that American artist can spend half a million on a music video, and Japanese idols probably don't get any where near that much.I don't see why fans would regard them higher than any other groups. Maybe because they've been around longer, but beyond that I can't fathom why.Lol. Morning Musume is probably never going to make better music videos. Even at the peak of their popularity, their videos weren't all that amazing.\n\nI would say that you're still a biased fan though, since you are defending MM which means your biased, just in their favor and not against them.\n\nI don't think you need a super high budget in order to make a nice PV, and it would be nice if MM's PVs were more creative tbh. Souda we're alive is my favorite MM single, and even though the PV is stupid, at least it shows the girls doing different things and posing and being random and silly while doing the same old close up/dance shot formula. I liked Maji Desu ka Suka PV, but I feel like what people miss is the more relaxed feeling old PVs had or they want something a little more aesthetically appealing, like new angles and interesting backdrops and composition just so it doesn't look half assed (c-ute's shiny hotpant song (sorry, I don't remember its name) video featured the same dance shot/close up thing plus a chair and an apple, and it even recycled the backdrop from OOLG but people liked it because it had better takes and it wasn't as simplistic)\n\nI would say I am slightly biased against them. But not in the sense that I think they are superior. More in the sense that I see how great they are, and wish everyone else saw it too. However, I don't think this post is biased at all. I'm just pointing out how people seem to judge Momusu's simple PVs harshly. But when other idol groups release simple PVs no one says anything. I also want to point out that I love most of the example PVs. The only PVs I didn't like are KAT-TUN's, Canary Clubs', and Hey! Say! JUMP's.\n\nI agree you don't need a high budget to make a great PV, and that Momusu's PVs lately lack creativity. Because they honestly do. Souda We're Alive is actually one of my least favorite single. But I do love the PV because of how random and fun it is. I usually like PVs that are silly, fun, and energetic. I don't even really care what the set looks like if the PV is itself is fun. See, I would personally hate more relaxed PVs. I'm just not into them. Because with more relaxed PVs I seem to focus on the set and dance more. Which almost laways turn out to be horrible. Shiny hot pants song, is the greatest way I've ever heard the song described. It's Kiss Me Aishiteru, btw. And I actually didn't like that PV at all. XD The girls looked pretty but the PV was too simple. So simple I didn't even bother writing a PV review about it. ><&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.040284947,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.040285&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:23,&quot;score&quot;:0.008711713},{&quot;begin&quot;:23,&quot;end&quot;:65,&quot;score&quot;:0.038911518},{&quot;begin&quot;:65,&quot;end&quot;:183,&quot;score&quot;:0.0015878921},{&quot;begin&quot;:183,&quot;end&quot;:283,&quot;score&quot;:0.023803791},{&quot;begin&quot;:283,&quot;end&quot;:330,&quot;score&quot;:0.0253489},{&quot;begin&quot;:330,&quot;end&quot;:444,&quot;score&quot;:0.033246122},{&quot;begin&quot;:444,&quot;end&quot;:552,&quot;score&quot;:0.06532243},{&quot;begin&quot;:552,&quot;end&quot;:622,&quot;score&quot;:0.002950182},{&quot;begin&quot;:622,&quot;end&quot;:648,&quot;score&quot;:0.019297661},{&quot;begin&quot;:648,&quot;end&quot;:14948,&quot;score&quot;:0.22981352}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 23,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008711713\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 23,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.038911518\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 183,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0015878921\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 183,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 283,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.023803791\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 283,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 330,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0253489\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 330,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 444,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.033246122\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 444,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 552,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.06532243\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 552,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 622,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.002950182\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 622,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 648,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.019297661\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 648,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 14948,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.22981352\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;                            UNPUBLISHED\n\n                   UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                       FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                            No. 01-7493\n\n\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                               Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n          versus\n\n\nMILTON SYLVESTER CURRIE,\n\n                                              Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of North Carolina, at Statesville.

FASEB J., 2016 30:1941-1957). Attempting to accelerate metabolism by the addition of membrane-permeant dimethyl-2-oxoglutarate (dm2OG) to HepG2 cells pre-adapted to hypoxia, we found cristae narrowing by transmission electron microscopy. Glycolytic HepG2 cells, which downregulate hypoxic respiration, instantly increased respiration with dm2OG. Changes in intracristal space (ICS) morphology were also revealed by 3D super-resolution microscopy using Eos-conjugated ICS-located lactamase-β. Cristae topology was resolved in detail by focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). The spatial relocations of key cristae-shaping proteins were indicated by immunocytochemical stochastic 3D super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM), while analyzing inter-antibody-distance histograms: i) ATP-synthase dimers exhibited a higher fraction of shorter inter-distances between bound F1-α primary Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated antibodies, indicating cristae narrowing. ii) Mic60/mitofilin clusters (established upon hypoxia) decayed, restoring isotropic random Mic60/mitofilin distribution (a signature of normoxia). iii) outer membrane SAMM50 formed more focused clusters. Less abundant fractions of higher ATP-synthase oligomers of hypoxic samples on blue-native electrophoresis became more abundant fractions at the high dm2OG load and at normoxia. This indicates more labile ATP-synthase dimeric rows established at crista rims upon hypoxia, strengthened at normoxia or dm2OG-substrate load. Hypothetically, the increased Krebs substrate load stimulates the cross-linking/strengthening of rows of ATP-synthase dimers at the crista rims, making them sharper. Crista narrowing ensures a more efficient coupling of proton pumping to ATP synthesis. We demonstrated that cristae morphology changes even within minutes.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;PubMed Abstracts\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.018464668,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.018465&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:65,&quot;score&quot;:0.13565879},{&quot;begin&quot;:65,&quot;end&quot;:292,&quot;score&quot;:0.011453647},{&quot;begin&quot;:292,&quot;end&quot;:322,&quot;score&quot;:0.0004598813},{&quot;begin&quot;:322,&quot;end&quot;:530,&quot;score&quot;:0.019158829},{&quot;begin&quot;:530,&quot;end&quot;:638,&quot;score&quot;:0.062125895},{&quot;begin&quot;:638,&quot;end&quot;:784,&quot;score&quot;:0.011037151},{&quot;begin&quot;:784,&quot;end&quot;:884,&quot;score&quot;:0.0036616963},{&quot;begin&quot;:884,&quot;end&quot;:1391,&quot;score&quot;:0.0048244153},{&quot;begin&quot;:1391,&quot;end&quot;:1460,&quot;score&quot;:0.05653196},{&quot;begin&quot;:1460,&quot;end&quot;:2103,&quot;score&quot;:0.05253629}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.13565879\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 65,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 292,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.011453647\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 292,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 322,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0004598813\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 322,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 530,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.019158829\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 530,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 638,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.062125895\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 638,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 784,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.011037151\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 784,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 884,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0036616963\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 884,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1391,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0048244153\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1391,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1460,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.05653196\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1460,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 2103,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.05253629\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Carolina Falkholt\n\nCarolina Alexandra Falkholt, with the pseudonym Blue, born March 4, 1977 in Gothenburg, is a Swedish artist, graffiti writer and musician. Sometimes she uses her own coined term grafitta, to describe her art. It is a play with the two words graffiti and fitta, the latter means \&quot;pussy\&quot; in Swedish but also with a Swedish grammatical habit of setting a gender to work titles where an \&quot;a\&quot; denotes female role.\n\nBiography \nCarolina Falkholt grew up in Dals Långed, Dalsland, Sweden. As a teenager, she moved to Stockholm to go to the waldorf school Kristofferskolan. At the same time she began painting graffiti under the pseudonym Blue. By the mid-1990s, she moved to New York City. There, as the only Swedish artist, she became a member of the two crews The Fantastic Partners and Hardcore Chickz. She worked with graffiti writers such as Sento and Lady Pink while making paintings around New York for the record company Rawkus to earn a living. Around the turn of the century, she was one of Sweden's most famous graffiti writers. After four years In New York, she moved back to Sweden and settled in Gothenburg where she is active today.\n\nArtistic practice \nIn addition to spray paint and drawing, Carolina Falkholt practice involve collage, sculpture, installation, performance, film and photo. She often build up her drawings with endless amounts of circles creating a web, sometimes over vibrant colors. Typical motifs she has been investigating in her art is connected to the body, like eyes, ears, mouth, hands and the vagina. In many of her paintings of hands it is actually letters, since she is using Swedish Sign Language in her art. She is also a musician and has released records as part of her artistic practice. In several projects she has initiated various forms of collaboration with other artists, musicians, the public and organizations.\n\nIn 2010, Falkholt realized the big project Graffiti Mariestad that circulated around a now demolished silo in Mariestad harbor. During a number of months before the building was to be dismantled, the façade was painted while activities in and around the silo were ongoing. The project involved about 30 graffiti writers, including Nug, Rubin and Dwane, musicians, dancers, artists and hundreds of young people. The project resulted in one of the world's largest graffiti paintings. The project Graffiti Mariestad also resulted in Falkholt being commissioned to create a public sculpture in Mariestad, which was built, among other things, from material from the demolished silo. The twelve-meter high sculpture  T.E.S.T. was inaugurated in June 2011. The whole process is documented in the book SILO.\n\nCarolina Falkholt has had solo exhibitions at Gothenburg Museum of Art, Eskilstuna Museum of Art, Ystad Art Museum, Steneby Konsthall in Dalsland and Klippans konsthall in Skåne., among others. In 2013, she was one of the participants in Swedish Televisions (SVT) program Konstkuppen and that same year she curated and participated as an artist in the exhibition Mynningsladdare (Muzzleloader) at Röda Sten Konsthall in Gothenburg. In the same year, she participated in the X-Border biennial with the project Firewall with paintings in the three towns Severomorsk, Rovaniemi and Luleå and made the 16 meter long piece Wet Paint at Kulturhuset in Stockholm. Falkholt is represented by, among others, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Skövde Museum of Art and Halland Museum of Cultural History. In 2014 she made the painting Övermålning (Overpainting) as a commission for a highschool in Nyköping. She started by writing derogatory words towards women on the wall and then painted them over with a stylized motif of the lower part of a womans naked body. The artwork created a heated argument which was covered in media, both in Sweden and internationally. At one point politicians took the decision to build a wall in front of the painting. But Falholt and the painting had many strong supporters. The principal of the school said: \&quot;I see many pedagogic advantages to having her art in the school\&quot;. After much debate the wall in front of the painting was taken down. In connection with this debate she made a performance at Konstakademien in Stockholm, where she invited politicians to Skenbröllop, a sham marriage with her. Two politicians said yes, Marita Ulvskog (Swedish Social Democratic Party) and Sissela Nordling Blanco (Feminist Initiative).\n\nIn 2015 she made a huge mural as a commission for the highschool Parkskolan in Ystad. The painting Untitled (Firewall), depict yet another stylized naked woman haning upside down with her legs in an unnatural contorted position. 2017 she was invited as one on the artist for the exhibition SculptureMotion at Wanås sculpture park, together with William Forsythe, Henrik Plenge Jakobsen, Sonia Khurana and Éva Mag. For this exhibition she did the work Train of thoughts, a railroad car moved to the woods, first painted white and then filled with her black circles creating an organic web over the whole surface.\n\nIn December 2017 she painted a 40 foot erect human penis on a building at 303 Broome Street, New York, NY. She signed the artwork on the lower right hand side. The mural was painted over by the buildings owner three days later.\n\nGallery\n\nPublic works (in selection) \n T.E.S.T. , Mariestad, Sweden, 2011–12\n Wall painting on the facade of Bengtsfors Sports Hall, Sweden, 2012\n Freedom of expression, Järnvägsgatan in Alingsås, Sweden, 2012\n Facade painting on a day-care building in Durres, Albania, 2013\n Untitled, Bergslagsvägen 43, Avesta, Sweden, 2013\n Pi, on the facade of the student house Jakten, Halmstad, Sweden, 2013\n Untitled (Firewall), Borås, Sweden, 2014\n Övermålning, Nyköping High School, Nyköping, Sweden, 2014 \n Untitled (Firewall), wall painting at Parkskolan in Ystad, Sweden, 2015\n Untitled (Firewall), wall painting, Södra Dragongatan in Ystad, Sweden, 2015\n Fountain, GrEEK Campus, Cairo, Egypt, 2015\n TECHNE, Mimers house of Culture, Kungälv, Sweden, 2016\n Fuck the World, Kungsholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, 2018\n\nFuck the World\nFuck the World is a mural by Falkholt which depicts an erect blue penis and covers five storeys of an apartment block () in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe work was unveiled in April 2018 on Kronobergsvägen in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm. Falkholt whose work explores human sexuality said of it, \&quot;They should consider what it is they are so upset about and then talk about it\&quot;  and \&quot;Sex is so important, but it’s always been too dirty to discuss.\&quot;\n\nFalkholt was confident that Stockholm residents would be receptive to the work and that it would avoid the fate of an earlier work of a pink and orange penis which was painted on the side of a four-storey building in lower Manhattan in December 2017, but was painted over after a few weeks. However following complaints from neighbouring residents, it was announced a week after being unveiled that the work is to be painted over.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n CV (pdf) - grossestreffen.org\n\nCategory:Swedish artists\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1977 births\nCategory:Swedish graffiti artists&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Wikipedia (en)\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.28996843,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.289968&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:18,&quot;score&quot;:0.008191093},{&quot;begin&quot;:18,&quot;end&quot;:158,&quot;score&quot;:0.012425472},{&quot;begin&quot;:158,&quot;end&quot;:228,&quot;score&quot;:0.045091953},{&quot;begin&quot;:228,&quot;end&quot;:427,&quot;score&quot;:0.5750231},{&quot;begin&quot;:427,&quot;end&quot;:439,&quot;score&quot;:0.013119632},{&quot;begin&quot;:439,&quot;end&quot;:499,&quot;score&quot;:0.018187003},{&quot;begin&quot;:499,&quot;end&quot;:583,&quot;score&quot;:0.013605545},{&quot;begin&quot;:583,&quot;end&quot;:654,&quot;score&quot;:0.0136749605},{&quot;begin&quot;:654,&quot;end&quot;:700,&quot;score&quot;:0.011037151},{&quot;begin&quot;:700,&quot;end&quot;:7128,&quot;score&quot;:0.0789077}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 18,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.008191093\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 18,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 158,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012425472\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 158,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 228,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.045091953\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 228,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 427,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.5750231\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 427,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 439,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013119632\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 439,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 499,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.018187003\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 499,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 583,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013605545\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 583,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 654,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0136749605\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 654,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 700,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.011037151\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 700,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 7128,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0789077\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:41,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Previous post Walmart – No lamp for you, deal with it!

In the current structure of Ukraine's industry a great proportion is occupied by heavy industry, especially the steel, machine-building and coal industries. A considerable part is played by the food and light industries. Top position is held by machine building.\n\nThe black coal industry is concentrated in two basins: Donets and Lviv-Vol-hynia. The largest centre of the brown coal industry is Kirovograd region. The oil and gas industries are located in the Subcarpathian and Left-Bank regions, but the extraction of oil and natural gas is insufficient to satisfy the country's needs.\n\nUkraine has a strong power generation industry. Large thermal and hydroelectric stations have been built. There are 10 nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Apart from the infamous plant in Chor-nobyl, others are to be found in Rivne, Zaporizhia, Khmelnytsky, the Crimea and Mykolayiv regions.\n\nThe metallurgical industry includes the ferrous and non-ferrous industries. Metallurgical plants are spread through three regions — the Donbas, Dnieper and Azov Coast regions.\n\nThe machine-building industry is presently the largest branch of industry. Instrument-making is one of the most scattered branch. A plant in Sumy produces such diverse instruments as electron microscopes and cine-cameras. An important place is occupied by heavy machine building, which provides plant and equipment for metallurgy, power stations and cement plants. A large plant is located in Kramatorsk and is a leading supplier of metallurgical equipment and powerful excavators. Smaller enterprises have been built in other centers of the Donbas and Dnieper area. Here large plants turn out powerful turbines, generators and steam boilers.\n\nShipbuilding is now an important branch of industry. Seagoing vessels are built at shipyards located in Mykolayiv, Kherson and Kyiv.\nThe motor vehicle industry sprung up after WW II, Buses are produced in Lviv, passenger cars in Zaporizhia, lorries in Kremenchuk, and both passenger and transport vehicles in Lutsk. Kharkiv has a specialized vehicle engine works. Aeroplanes are built in Kyiv and Kharkiv.\n\nFarm machinery plants turn out nearly all types of soil cultivating, sowing and harvesting machines. The manufacture of tractors and combine harvesters is concentrated in large plants such as Kharkiv Tractor Works.\n\nThe chemical industry embraces the production of acids, alkalis, salts, fertilizers, dyes, detergents, plastics, synthetic fibres, pharmaceuticals and other goods.\n\nThe manufacture of building materials is well-developed in all of Ukraine's regions. Ukrainian limestone, sandstone, marble, granite, gabbro and labradorite already face thousands of buildings through the country. Cement works are located mainly in the Donets-Dnieper and Southwestern Economic Areas.\n\nUkraine's food industry is located mostly in the Forest-Steppe (sugar), the Steppe (vegetable oils), the South (fruit canning, wine). There are many textile enterprises in Ukraine: cotton (Kherson, Ternopil), linen (Rivne, Zhytomyr), wool (Chernihiv, Luhansk), silk (Kyiv, Cherkasy). Garment and footwear industries are located in large population centres. China and pottery enterprises have developed in Kharkiv, Sloviansk, in the area of Novohrad-Volynsky.&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;Pile-CC\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.09387396,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.093874&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:9,&quot;score&quot;:0.0090240855},{&quot;begin&quot;:9,&quot;end&quot;:19,&quot;score&quot;:0.009926494},{&quot;begin&quot;:19,&quot;end&quot;:78,&quot;score&quot;:0.012494888},{&quot;begin&quot;:78,&quot;end&quot;:235,&quot;score&quot;:0.014785618},{&quot;begin&quot;:235,&quot;end&quot;:299,&quot;score&quot;:0.011870144},{&quot;begin&quot;:299,&quot;end&quot;:341,&quot;score&quot;:0.00999591},{&quot;begin&quot;:341,&quot;end&quot;:424,&quot;score&quot;:0.13745339},{&quot;begin&quot;:424,&quot;end&quot;:492,&quot;score&quot;:0.050242316},{&quot;begin&quot;:492,&quot;end&quot;:665,&quot;score&quot;:0.027065687},{&quot;begin&quot;:665,&quot;end&quot;:3325,&quot;score&quot;:0.056931525}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 9,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0090240855\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 9,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 19,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009926494\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 19,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 78,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012494888\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 78,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 235,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.014785618\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 235,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 299,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.011870144\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 299,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 341,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.00999591\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 341,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 424,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.13745339\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 424,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 492,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.050242316\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 492,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 665,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.027065687\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 665,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 3325,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.056931525\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:45,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have severed ties with four major tabloids based in the U.K. Now that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have stepped down from their duties as part of the royal family, the couple took another step toward distancing themselves by sending a letter to the editor of TheDaily Mail, The Sun, TheExpress and TheMirror.\n\nAs Buzzfeed reports, the letter was sent Sunday night and stating the couple \&quot;believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy -- particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what’s right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.\&quot; After an opening up with a reverent declaration, it quickly shifts gears. Particularly when it condemns \&quot;an influential slice of the media\&quot; that \&quot;has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print -- even when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason.\&quot;\n\nThe letter goes on to explain that they've \&quot;watched people they know -- as well as complete strangers -- have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.\&quot; At that point, the couple indicates that they will \&quot;not be engaging\&quot; with those four outlets. They went on to clarify that this was not a \&quot;blanket policy for all media,\&quot; but they would no longer \&quot;offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion.\&quot;\n\nOn Monday, Markle also gave an interview with Good Morning America, although it was actually taped before the couple made their decision public.

It as expected, displays the current clusters using coloured plots in matplotlib.\nIssues\n\nkmean_step seems really ugly for an algorithm that can be described by:\n\nRecluster the dataset around the centroids;\nRecenter the centroids with their clusters.\n\nI am a bit unsure about the termination conditions in the kmean function. I have read that they are:\n\nCentroids don't move,\nor Cluster membership does not change,\nor number of iterations exceeds preset max.\n\nI have the first and last of those, but the second seems like it will happen automatically by the first. If the cluster membership doesn't change, then the center doesn't move. Do I really need to include it? (it is surprisingly hard to implement) Or is it only included in the algorithm description for clarity?\nIs this an optimal way to implement it? To fully take advantage of vectorized operations? I am a bit iff about having 2 list comprehensions, particularly since one immediately cases to a ndarrray.\n\nA:\n\n1. Code review\n\nThere's no documentation. What do your functions do and how am I supposed to call them?\nThere are no test cases. What gives you confidence that the algorithm is correct?\nThe algorithm is called \&quot;\\$k\\$-means\&quot; (not \&quot;\\$k\\$-mean\&quot;) so I would name the functions accordingly.\nThe do_print mechanism looks as if it was added to help with debugging and then you forgot to remove it. Surely no user of this code is going to be interested in this? It would be better to use Python's built-in debugging facilities so that you don't need to add this kind of debugging code.\nSimilarly for the \&quot;After %i generations stabilised\&quot; message.\nThe steps in the \\$k\\$-means algorithm are not normally known as generations so you might want to choose a clearer name, for example steps or iterations.\nThe iterator range is exclusive at the top end. So range(1, n_gen) iterates from 1 up to ngen - 1 inclusive, which is probably not what you meant.\nIf n_gens is less than 2, kmean returns None instead of a list of clusters. It would be better to raise an exception in this case, so that the caller doesn't have to handle the exceptional return value. Alternatively, you could ensure that at least one step is taken. (Which is what I've done in my revised code below.)\nYour chosen format for the return value of kmean (a list of clusters, each cluster being an array of datapoints) is likely to be inconvenient for further processing by NumPy. Generally in NumPy we want everything to be returned as uniform arrays. So if you do want to return the clusters (rather than the centroids), it would be better to return them in the form of an array giving the cluster number for each datapoint (that is, in the format of your cluster_allocs array).\nYour implementation omits the initialization step (that is, the selection of initial candidate values for the centroids). It would make sense to include at least one initialization method (for example, Forgy) so that the burden is not imposed on the caller.\nThe kmean_step operations are hard to follow because the variables are not clearly named (what is ds? what is the e in e_dists) and because you have expressed all your loops in the form of list comprehensions. When a comprehension becomes so long and unwieldy that you feel the need to use obscure variable names like ci and cl, it's probably time to rewrite it as a loop.\nThe function kmean_step is not likely to be useful to the caller, so there's no good reason to put this part of the code in its own function. The component of the algorithm that's likely to be generally useful is the computation of the centroids of the clusters.\nPairwise distances can be computed using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.\nYou don't need to take square roots: squared distances are sufficient to determine the closest centroid to each data point. So if you are using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist then you'd use the sqeuclidean metric.\n\n2. Revised code\nNote the docstrings, the example code (which you can run as test cases using the doctest module), and the simple and straightforward implementation.

We (everyone, both scientists and others) know enough to say removing water right now can’t help but make the drought emergency worse for those streams that are already stressed to the max.\n\n“And yet, in all of this, water continues to run in their pipes, robbing it from this very critical watershed. And not just any environment. Very sad.” — Retired Forest Service biologist with over 40 years on the job, in a statement via email.\n\nAn ongoing investigation by the Anti-Media — sparked by Ian James’ series in the Desert Sun — into Nestle’s sourcing its bottled water from Arrowhead Springs, (located in San Bernardino National Forest) using a permit that expired over a quarter century ago, just made a rather stunning discovery.\n\n“And, by the way, these aren’t springs as you and I envision a spring bubbling up out of the ground — they have horizontal wells that go into the mountainside, sometimes as far as 500 feet. And those horizontal pipes, of course, create a void; and water always seeks the path of least resistance, so the water seeps into their horizontal pipes and then drains out of the side of the mountain,” explained Gary Earney — who retired after decades with the U.S. Forest Service, where he was in charge of granting special-use permits — in a phone call with the Anti-Media.\n\nCalifornia water is an unnecessarily complex topic that was further complicated when the continuing drought forced the governor to institute a system of restrictions and fines. Intended to ensure no individual or business would waste the precious resource, the restrictions and fines actually stratified and delineated the wealth gap — those who can afford to do so simply pay whatever fine is necessary to lessen the impact restrictions would create on daily life.\n\nYou know . . . what drought?\n\nPrevious articles in the series:\n\nAvoid Saying “It’s Just Water” on Your Trip to California\n\nOf critical importance to circumstances surrounding Nestle’s ostensible draw and collection of spring water — brought to retail bearing the label: Arrowhead 100% Mountain Spring Water — is the fact that the bottles bear the company’s claim its water is sourced from a natural “spring.”\n\nTo wit, compare the legal definitions for bottled “spring” and “well” water, under the Code of Federal Regulations: Title 21 § 165.110 (a)(2)(vi)(viii):\n\n(vi) The name of water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth may be “spring water.” Spring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice. The location of the spring shall be identified. Spring water collected with the use of an external force shall be from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. If spring water is collected with the use of an external force, water must continue to flow naturally to the surface of the earth through the spring’s natural orifice . Plants shall demonstrate, on request, to appropriate regulatory officials, using a hydrogeologically valid method, that an appropriate hydraulic connection exists between the natural orifice of the spring and the bore hole.\n\n(viii) The name of water from a hole bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground which taps the water of an aquifer may be “well water.”\n\nClick here to read the entire document\n\nSee where this is heading?\n\nNo, It Isn’t Sping Water, and the Inspector General Has Known That for Years\n\nBy these definitions, and in the context of Earney’s description, an emphatically pertinent question is raised: Is the water Nestle draws from what is ostensibly the site of Arrowhead Springs, really what the company claims it is on the bottle — is it actually “spring” water, at all?\n\nConversation with Earney continued:\n\nQuestion: “By any stretch of the imagination, can what they’re [Nestle] doing be described as pulling spring water, in your estimation?” Earney: “Actually, in my estimate, no — and the Office of the Inspector General, which did an inspection of that use a few years back, determined that Nestle was not taking spring water, they were taking groundwater.” During the call, he also verified water at the site of the springs is not, in fact, coming naturally to the surface — nor could it, given Nestle’s extensive piping infrastructure.\n\nIt’s important to note, as Earney emphasized, that the Forest Service has nothing to do with the laws and regulations governing water rights in the state. Because the supposed spring is located on property the Forest Service is tasked with maintaining, the agency deals purely with the infrastructure Nestle uses, and its maintenance and impact on the property.\n\nAbout Those Water Rights\n\nNestle has claimed for years its rights to Arrowhead Springs date back to the turn of the last century — however, not-so-strangely, deed transfers marking Arrowhead Springs’ supposed migration through a string of dissolving and forming Nestle companies have been notoriously difficult to track down. A subject of contention for many, Nestle’s loud claims to historic rights are beginning to sound hollow when requests to view relevant documentation are simply shrugged off.\n\nCould a deed from 1929 offer insight into Nestle’s reluctance to be transparent and forthcoming?\n\nClearly delineated in the text of this deed are rights to subterranean water at the site — but the only property denoting springs is Indian Springs.\n\nIncidentally, as reported in The Pontiac Tribune, both the first and second articles in this series about the Nestle scandal were upvoted to occupy positions near the top of Reddit‘s front page. However — just as the second article seemed to reach its peak popularity — Reddit seemingly extended a corporate arm when the board’s moderators censored the article by removing it from the page entirely. Eventually, the reason for its banishment was said to be due to an assessment the article amounted to an opinion piece. Coincidentally, the article gained a spot at the top of the prized Reddit front page before anyone found this to be a problem.\n\nIn the Nestle vs. California drought debate, what is your opinion on water rights?\n\nThis is the third in our series of investigations into Nestle’s role in extracting massive amounts of groundwater in California during the record drought. The fourth in this series will include exclusive information from sources with knowledge of Nestle’s bottling operations who have reached out to Anti-Media in recent weeks.

I'm used to creating a connection string and connecting to a remote DB server (MySQL, MSSQL Srv, Oracle, etc.). I know this question is probably quite silly, but being in uncharted waters here, I can't seem to find the answer to this on my own.\nSo I'm writing a Java app that uses SQLiteJDBC as the Java driver for SQLite (the app's embedded db) and am creating the tables and inserting records into them from the Java app itself. What I'd like to do is download/install SQLite on my system - completely independent of the Java app - and then write SQL scripts that will do the \&quot;skeletonizing\&quot; (creating &amp; insertions) of the database file itself, then copy that .sqlite file into my project directory where the app can then use it.\nI'm just finding it incredibly difficult to develop database schema from inside the Java app itself; just seems like an unnecessary step.\nSo, my question:\nIs this even possible? To create, say, myProgramDB.sqlite off the command line with the SQLite tool, and then (essentially) cut-n'-paste that file into my Eclipse/NetBeans project (of course, in the right directory!) and have it work? This is also assuming I have correctly imported the SQLiteJDBC JAR into my project through the IDE.  I just want to create the DB somewhere else, then copy it into my project, instead of developing the DB through my app directly.\nThanks for any insight!\n\nA:\n\nJust think of the database as a normal file which your app refers to either by an absolute or relative file path, so with that in mind embed it in your project like you would any other file in Eclipse (or point to a specific location where you expect it to be).\nIf you're going to create your db manually, SQLiteStudio (http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/) is free tool which will help you build the schema.\nIt also lets you export the structure and/or data as sql statements, which you can then use to build a copy of your database elsewhere.\n\n&quot;},&quot;meta&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;pile_set_name\&quot;: \&quot;StackExchange\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;score&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.11407687,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0.114077&quot;},&quot;span_scores&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;begin&quot;:0,&quot;end&quot;:25,&quot;score&quot;:0.0067333565},{&quot;begin&quot;:25,&quot;end&quot;:127,&quot;score&quot;:0.0100653265},{&quot;begin&quot;:127,&quot;end&quot;:239,&quot;score&quot;:0.009232334},{&quot;begin&quot;:239,&quot;end&quot;:372,&quot;score&quot;:0.31714454},{&quot;begin&quot;:372,&quot;end&quot;:558,&quot;score&quot;:0.009371166},{&quot;begin&quot;:558,&quot;end&quot;:859,&quot;score&quot;:0.017145762},{&quot;begin&quot;:859,&quot;end&quot;:997,&quot;score&quot;:0.020963646},{&quot;begin&quot;:997,&quot;end&quot;:1014,&quot;score&quot;:0.012217224},{&quot;begin&quot;:1014,&quot;end&quot;:1037,&quot;score&quot;:0.021380141},{&quot;begin&quot;:1037,&quot;end&quot;:2045,&quot;score&quot;:0.013536129}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 25,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0067333565\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 25,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 127,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.0100653265\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 127,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 239,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009232334\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 239,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 372,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.31714454\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 372,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 558,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.009371166\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 558,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 859,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.017145762\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 859,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 997,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.020963646\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 997,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1014,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.012217224\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1014,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 1037,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.021380141\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;begin\&quot;: 1037,\n    \&quot;end\&quot;: 2045,\n    \&quot;score\&quot;: 0.013536129\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:50,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;.. _`Preface`:\r\n\r\n#######\r\nPreface\r\n#######\r\n\r\n..

Taking a cue from the ABC show Shark Tank, the VA Innovation Demo Day brought these employee-entrepreneurs before a panel of VA leaders, including VA Undersecretary for Health Dr. David Shulkin, who said the goal of the event was to highlight programs that could work for the system at large.



"Those of us who have a chance to visit different VAs across run into staff who have terrific ideas and are working to make lives better for veterans, but those ideas tend to stay within these isolated VAs," Shulkin said. "The best thing to do was to surface these best practices and, once we believe they are making a difference, make sure they are consistently applied."



Since he was appointed to his position a year ago, Shulkin has sought to promote entrepreneurship within the ranks. Earlier this year, VA established a new Center for Innovation that oversees an "innovators network" to provide training, support and funding for problem solving.



The initiatives showcased at the D.C. event addressed several widely recognized issues at VA, from problems with access to care to suicide prevention, mental health services and technology.



The 33 projects pitched at the event included: Fitbits for aging patients and Apple watches for veterans in rural regions to monitor physical activity; using nurses to triage same-day appointment requests to ensure immediate care for those who it; and increasing access to complimentary activities like yoga, art and writing to improve wellness.



All were funded by one of three VA programs, including "Spark" grants that give $5,000 to $10,000 to get an idea rolling, "Seed" grants of less than $50,000 that can be obtained once an idea has demonstrated the project will work and "Spread" grants between $100,000 and $500,000 to expand the projects to other VA facilities.



VA Boston Healthcare System gastroenterologist Dr. Navin Kumar used a Spark grant to develop a smartphone app that would help patients prep properly for a colonoscopy.



Hooking his audience with slides of improperly prepped colons and unsettling statistics, Kumar said doctors miss pre-cancerous growths in about a third of patients who didn't follow the required bowel cleansing protocol before their procedure.



His app, developed with the help of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, guides patients through the proper diet, fluid intake and bowel prep the week before their colonoscopy. Following Kumar's presentation, an audience member asked to speak with him about patenting the design.



"This is great," Kumar said after meeting with several administrators and doctors interested in his creation. "When I walked in this room, I was like, where am I? It's so modern, which is not usually what people think of when they hear 'VA.'"



Shulkin said the employees selected to present at the D.C. event had to demonstrate that their projects were attractive to VA facilities beyond their own, and the presentations were streamed to major VA facilities, where staff members were watching.



"These are clearly ideas that not only can help VA but can help private health facilities around the country," he said.



Shulkin said he thinks the value of the demonstration day lies in the ideas that eventually will be adopted and those that have yet to be conceived.



"The VA had become a place that was so criticized that people didn't feel they were allowed to enjoy what they are doing. But when you combine the passion people have for caring for veterans with the ability to use their brains and implement ideas, it brings joy back to work," he said. "It's exciting."

Articles on Leadership
and Decision Making

Problem Definition
A clear problem definition is the first, and, perhaps, most important step
toward rationally selecting the best alternative. Many dedicated and intelligent
individuals have produced elegant solutions for problems other than those they
were tasked to solve. Therefore, a good executive decision maker participates in
problem definition because this step establishes the goal for everything else
that follows and places a premium on professional judgment.READ MORE

Consensus Team Decision Making
The Westerner and the Japanese man mean something different when they talk of
"making a decision." In the West, all the emphasis is on the answer to the
question. To the Japanese, however, the important element in decision making is
defining the question. The crucial steps are to decide whether there is a need
for a decision and what the decision is about. And it is in that step that the
Japanese aim at attaining consensus. Indeed, it is this step that, to the
Japanese, is the essence of decision. The answer to the question (what the West
considers the decision) follows from its definition. During the process that
precedes the decision, no mention is made of what the answer might be. . . .
Thus the whole process is focused on finding out what the decision is really
about, not what the decision should be.READ MORE

Effective Decision Making
One of the critical, but often overlooked, requirements for effective leadership
is sound decision making. This is especially true as we soar ever higher into
the ranks of middle and upper management. Typically, as this progression occurs,
leaders become more focused on strategic decisions relating to plans, policies,
programs and personnel, and less consumed with day-to-day tactical concerns.
Good decision making, especially in middle and upper management, will therefore
likely increase overall organizational health and effectiveness. Understanding
the meaning and art of deciding, therefore, is paramount.READ MORE

Ethical Decision-Making: The Link Between Ambiguity and
Accountability
A growing body of literature thoroughly examines the topic of ethics in public
service from numerous, contrary, and complementary perspectives. What is ethics
in public service? Ethics in public service is the study of the nature of
morals and moral choices and the rules governing a profession that define
professional conduct (Bruce, 2001, p. xiii). How do we know if it is effective?
Who determines? How do we measure it? In answering these questions it becomes
remarkably clear that there are no absolutes. Nor is there any single school of
thought or theory to guide the inquiry. Why do we try to understand ethics in
public service? The answer is clear: because we intuitively know it makes a
difference.READ MORE

NCOs and Values-Based Decision Making
In the Army of One, senior leaders look to the NCO Corps to embrace a value
system that develops character and to lead soldiers. The Army depends on its
NCOs to create the environment and set the tempo for success in full-spectrum
operations. Successful NCOs anticipate change, exploit every opportunity to meet
the units objectives and motivate their subordinates to higher levels of
productivity to achieve the units goals. Successful sergeants promote Army
Values and take care of soldiers in the process. In short, they are leaders with
values-based decision-making skills.READ ON

Studies in Group Leadership How Should We Decide Elements of
Sound Decision Making
Making decisions and solving problems takes much time and energy. But most
groups allow little time and energy to selecting a decision-making model or to
evaluating the process once the decision has been reached or a solution
attempted. Ideally, decisions arise as a result of judgments and reasoning to a
final conclusion, unfortunately, that is not always the case. Problem solving
involves the organization and arrangement of several decisions so that they will
have some usefulness solving a problem.READ MORE</span></div></div>

Girls Night Out - Smokey Blues

Hi Bellas,

I'm back with another makeup look from my Caress Girls Night Out Event. My friend Karla was wearing a sexy leopard print dress and I wanted to pick makeup that fit the occasion. To me, animal print can often be a neutral color. As a result, I went for a smokey eye (can't go wrong with that), but decided to mix it up.

Click here to see more!A lot of people who aren't used to color get a little scared when you try to apply something outside of the neutral category. The key is to use a "safe" color, in this case silver, and place it on the lid so that it fades into your brighter color. That way, the whole eye isn't too vibrant, but you can still add color in the middle and outer part of the lid. I picked more of a royal blue tone so that it would be a bit more wearable.

I used the bright royal blue from my Best of Both World's Yaby Palette. The color is super rich and pigmented. I also used a darker blue from my Barbie Stila palette as the outer v/contour color.

Karla was one of my last models in my chair. I think I had about 15 minutes to do her makeup...not too shabby right? It helps that I have most of my makeup in palettes...it makes for quick mixing and matching.

I loved how it came out...it really made her eyes pop, and I think the guys agreed because they couldn't keep their hands off her at the club, wink wink.

That's all for now, stay tuned for more makeup breakdowns from Caress Girls Night Out event!

The measurement of inequalities using composite indicators facilitates the prioritization and implementation of public health actions. The most commonly source of information used for this has been the Population and Housing Census of 2011 (PCH_2011).The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of PHC_2011 and develop a deprivation index (DI) by Basic Healthcare Area (BHA) and to analyse its association with mortality in Aragon. Ecological study by BHA. Since PHC_2011 was a sample of the population it was validated by the Chi-square test for homogeneity. 26 socioeconomic indicators were calculated. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR). Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were conducted using the indicators in which a significant correlation was found. Components with eigenvalues higher than 1 were extracted, and the rotated matrix (Varimax) was obtained. PCA from each component were conducted, extracting only one factor. BHA were grouped into, according to the deprivation index values. Mortality rates adjusted to the European Standard Population by age, sex and quartile were calculated. The most discriminant factor by quartiles was considered DI. A different DI for urban areas was obtained from the same variables. The validation of PHC sample detected 4 underrepresented BHA. 17 socioeconomic indicators were significatively correlated with SMR. From the first PCA, 3 components were obtained. The DI included %unemployment, %eventual workers, % insufficient education 16-64 years old and %foreigners. The % of variance explained by the DI was 59.7% and 73.8% in urban areas. In men, mortality in the quartile with the lowest deprivation (544,7 per 105; CI95%: 515,8-573,6) was significatively lower than in the most deprivated areas(618,7 per 105;CI95%:589,4-648,0). This new DI allows us to identify deprived BHA. This is a useful tool to bring to light health inequalities and to plan interventions according to population´s needs.</span></div></div>

"Slowly" is a 1954 song by Webb Pierce, written by Pierce and Nashville songwriter Tommy Hill (brother of singer Goldie Hill).  The song was one of Pierce's more successful singles, spending seventeen weeks at the top of the Country and Western Best Sellers lists and a total of thirty-six weeks in the chart.

Beyond its success as a song, "Slowly" was hugely influential in the history of country music, in that it was among the first (and certainly the most successful to date) songs to feature a pedal steel guitar. The song's iconic intro, played by Bud Isaacs, was said to have sent legions of lap steel guitar players scurrying to their closets for wire coat hangers, with which they attempted to modify their existing instruments to get the pitch shifting effect achieved by Isaacs.

Cover versions
On August 23, 1966, Connie Smith recorded the song which appeared on her album Connie in the Country (1967) 
In 1968, Jimmy Martin recorded the song which appeared in the album “Free-born Man” (1969)
In 1971, Jimmy Dean and Dottie West recorded a duet of the song, which hit the Top 40 on the country charts
In 1981, Kippi Brannon had her sole hit on the country charts with her version of the song

The opposite, proximal, end is introduced into the body and fluid is removed through the cannula by force of the suction. Typically, when a vacuum is provided from the vacuum source, the fluid is sucked into the opening on the proximal end of the tube, through the tube, and into a receptacle disposed “downstream” with respect to the tube. Such suction devices may become clogged, requiring cleaning of the suction devices.

On Friday, London-based Arabic-language newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat reported that Washington has not responded to overtures by the Palestinian Authority, reinforcing top negotiator Saeb Erekat’s claim to that effect earlier this week.

The Times of Israel has learned that Jason Greenblatt, the administration’s special representative for international negotiations, met on Friday with three Palestinian businessmen with close ties to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, and informed them that the administration does not intend to build relations with the PA at this juncture.

According to Palestinian sources, the three met Greenblatt in their capacity as businessmen, and not as formal representatives of the PA, although they did have Abbas’s blessing. The sources said the three told Greenblatt that they believe a strong Palestinian economy is essential for the two-state solution to become reality.

According to the Palestinian sources, Greenblatt told the three that, for now, the administration has no intention of engaging with the PA. It was understood that the administration will likely only do so after Trump meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 15, the sources said.

The three businessmen did not respond to efforts to reach them on Saturday evening.

A spokesperson for the US National Security Council denied Greenblatt had said the administration did not intend to engage Ramallah.

“Earlier this week, White House officials, including Jason Greenblatt, held a constructive introductory meeting with a group of Palestinian business leaders who were visiting Washington for meetings with US officials, Congress, and other organizations,” a statement from the NSC read. “This meeting was one of many such engagements the administration is conducting across all issue areas. The assertion that Mr. Greenblatt said that the United States does not intend to have a relationship with the Palestinian Authority at this juncture is false.”

American relations with the PA may soon be put to the test, in light of Trump’s repeated promises to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The prospect of a relocation has angered Palestinian and Arab leadership, with the former threatening such action would create a regional crisis.

Since his inauguration, Trump has appeared to back away from that pledge, saying in a recent interview that the move was “not easy” and giving it no more than “a chance” of occurring.

In another development that may encourage PA leadership, the White House said Thursday that settlement expansion “may not be helpful,” in a possible blow to Israeli leadership that has seen the Trump administration as wholly supportive of the settlement enterprise.

In late January, a senior Palestinian source told The Times of Israel that Washington froze the transfer of $221 million which was quietly authorized by the Obama administration in its final hours.

US officials conveyed to PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah that the funds were not expected to be handed over in the immediate future, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Erekat lashed out at the White House on Monday, telling Newsweek that if Trump’s first days in office were representative of the shape of things to come, “God help us, God help the whole world.

“We have sent them letters, written messages, they don’t even bother to respond to us,” he said of the new administration.

“It’s time for President Trump to… focus on what this region needs,” Erekat said. “What we need in this region is peace, what we need in this region is dialogue, what we need in this region is to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to the table.”

On Thursday, Trump met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. According to Jordan’s official news agency Petra, the two “agreed on the need to intensify efforts to reach a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that the NSC denied Greenblatt said the administration did not intend to engage with the PA yet.</span></div></div>

Implementation of or in foldr and foldl' in Data.List

Here is the declaration of or function from Prelude
or = foldr (||) False

This implementation is fine if the list fields contains at least one True
If the list contains all False then overflow can happen and  We have to reduce till last element
Here is the implementation using foldl'
or = foldl' (||) False

Here though it is inefficient since it has to reduce till last element of the list irrespective of the contents of the list argument. But we are guaranteed that we will not encounter an overflow.
So question is why not use the safer foldl' version

A:

If the list contains all False then […] We have to reduce till last element.

That is correct. 

If the list contains all False then overflow can happen […].

That's not. Other than functions like (+), (||) isn't strict in both arguments. It only pattern matches the left one:
(||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
(||) True _ = True
(||) _    x = x

Therefore, if we use the definition of foldr for lists, we get:
foldr (||) False [False,False])
  = False || (foldr (||) False [False]) -- use: False || x = x
  = foldr (||) False [False]
  = False || (foldr (||) False [])      -- use: False || x = x
  = foldr (||) False []
  = False

However, if we use a function where both arguments need to be fully evaluated we get into problems:
foldr (+) 0 [1,2]
  = 0 + (foldr (+) 1 [2])  -- cannot reduce (+), since it needs right hand side
  = 0 + (1 + (foldr (+) 2 []))
  = 0 + (1 + (2))
  = 0 + (3)
  = 3

Which is why you should use foldl' in this case. But for right-lazy functions like (||) or (:), foldr is perfectly fine.

We’ll have that review Monday morning, but for now: Watch as I try to cover the entire week’s news in one go. Luckily it was a pretty slow week—aside from BlizzCon and that crazy Warcraft movie trailer.

I don’t want to set the world on fire

Speaking of Fallout 4, here’s a launch trailer:

N7 day

BioWare’s teasing some Mass Effect “surprises” for tomorrow, November 7, or “N7 Day.” Welll, sort of. The official word is: “While we won’t have any major announcements for Mass Effect: Andromeda this N7 Day, keep an eye out on Saturday for some surprises that we’re sure you’ll enjoy.”

Cryptic.

The weekly delay news

InXile announced this week that Torment: Tides of Numenera (a.k.a. sort of the Planescape: Torment spiritual successor) is officially delayed until next year, though to be honest I think we all had sort of guessed that already. There hasn’t been much news about Torment in a while, and a beta test is supposed to happen before launch. And 2015 is basically over and done with. Better luck next year.

2K’s hero-driven shooter Battleborn also got pushed back a bit, from February to May of 2016.

It’s not porn, I swear

The Witcher is headed for film. Well, technically it’s headed for film “again” since there was already a movie made in 2001, but I’d warrant more people outside Poland know about Geralt this time around.

The new film is being made in conjunction with the studio that produced The Witcher 3’s gorgeous opening cinematic, so I have (maybe) high hopes. Via a press release: “The film will be an introduction to the Witcher’s world and is planned to be the beginning of a series. The film will be based on themes from the short stories ‘The Witcher’ and ‘Lesser Evil’ from ‘The Last Wish’ collection.”

Paragon

Epic “revealed” a new game called Paragon this week. Barely. So far, this is all we have to go on:

Who took over EA’s body?

Is this real life? It can’t be. EA subsidiary Ghost Games says it will not be selling DLC for its latest Need for Speed (coming to PC in early 2016). Let me repeat: Electronic Arts is not selling DLC in one of its games.

In an interview with Vice, Need for Speed creative director Craig Sullivan said “Everything we’re doing is focusing on listening to what the fans are asking for. They’re certainly not saying to us, ‘Can you build a load of stuff and charge us for it?’ They’re not saying that, so we’re not doing that.”

“The plan is that there are no transactions in this game,” he continued. “All of the content that we’re going to give you—a pretty substantial amount in the future, starting pretty soon—is going to be free. That’s what players deserve.”

Sounds like CD Projekt Red’s evangelizing rubbed off on someone else.

Who took over Activision’s body?

Call of Duty: Black Ops III is getting mod tools on the PC. Seriously. And community maps. Seriously. Like, you won’t need to pay for maps. You will have an infinite supply of community-made content. Seriously.

This is one hell of a weird week for people who usually rant against DLC.

Hope you stocked up on VRAM

Ahead of its launch on November 19, Ubisoft’s revealed the Minimum and Recommended Specs for Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. They’re recommending you pack at least 3GB of VRAM for an optimal experience. Also 50GB of storage. Hopefully it plays better than last year.</span></div></div>

As Charlie detailed back in February of last year, Vasiliev was ranked fairly highly by Central Scouting before injuries and worry about his willingness to leave Russia had him drop into the Flyers' lap in the last round of the draft. Considering seventh round picks rarely turn out to be worth anything, it made sense for the Flyers to cast those concerns aside and take a chance on potentially skilled player.

Position: Defense

Birthdate: May 31, 1994 (21)

Acquired Via: 2012 2012 NHL Draft -- Round 7, Pick 201

2014-15 Team/League: Avangard Omsk / Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod , KHL - 2 G, 3 A in 35 GP

Nationality: Russian (Moscow)

Size: 6'2", 207

Contract Status: None

Ranking in August 2014 25 Under 25: 19





When we last reviewed Vasiliev, he had just recently made the jump from Russia's major junior league to the KHL, where he had established himself as a third pairing, "stay at home" defenseman. The general gist was that even if he was prone to the occasional blunder and wasn't putting up stellar offensive numbers, he was getting ice time as a teenager in a league with some relatively skilled players.

So what has changed since then? Well, his offensive numbers haven't really jumped too much -- he put up 5 points in his 35 KHL games last season -- and it seems that his progression hasn't come along too much. Vasiliev attended the Flyers development camp back in July, and Bill Meltzer (who is always great in terms of prospect reports) had this to say:

He has been in the KHL for two-plus seasons but his ice time and development rate have been sporadic. The player himself said that added strength is a must to play the style that makes him effective. His most recently reported height and weight are 6-foot-1 and 203 pounds. Thus far, he has been a passable young KHL defenseman on a third pairing but not a player who jumps out as a clear candidate for the NHL. Injuries have been an issue, as has lack of opportunity. Going from a strong Avangard Omsk club midway through last season to a much weaker Nizhny Novgorod (his third KHL organization) meant more playing time. He played well in nine games for his new club.

So, yeah, not much has changed since last year. Vasiliev is a serviceable third pairing KHL defenseman, but there's obviously no indication as of now that he'll ever sniff ice time in the NHL. It's hard to expect much more out of a seventh round draft pick, though.

Obviously, the kid deserves a bit more time before any final verdict is given on his overall abilities, but we're probably best at tempering our expectations. Plus, given that the Flyers have a fairly strong pipeline of capable defenseman, I can't imagine he'll be cracking the Flyers roster anytime soon.

Regardless, his potential upside and decent enough professional play are enough to earn him the 25th spot on our list. Here's a video of him scoring a fun little goal at World Juniors back in 2014:

Several Celtics players helped recruit Horford with their active involvement in the process. A sizable contingent of players — including Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk — attended pitch meetings with top free-agent targets such as Horford and Kevin Durant after both hit the open market last month.

One piece of the team’s core who was notably absent at pitch meetings during free agency was Avery Bradley. While speaking at a Celtics and Arbella Insurance home court makeover unveiling event on Monday, the shooting guard explained his decision to stay on the sidelines during much of the process.


“I didn’t [recruit] that much,” Bradley said when asked by reporters about his attempts to recruit Durant. “Me and Kevin are like brothers so we talk all the time. So I’m not going to talk to him about that, you know what I mean? I was more asking him how he’s doing. I was actually with him a week before all that stuff went down at a camp in Austin [Texas], so I really wasn’t that much involved. I was more worried about myself, just getting healthy and making sure I was continuing to work out.”

Bradley and Durant both played basketball at the University of Texas. Even though their stints with the Longhorns were separated by a few seasons, they have developed a strong bond. While the 25-year-old would have loved Durant as a teammate in the NBA, he remains supportive of the All-Star’s decision to sign with Golden State.

“All I can say is that I’m happy for him, and I feel like he’s part of a great organization. And I wish the best for him. Kevin’s a really good guy and an even better player,” he said.

While the Celtics fell short in landing Durant, Bradley was not surprised that the team was able to add to the roster in a big way with Horford.


“To be honest, even though some people would say this is a tough place to come to obviously, I think if I were a player, I would want to come here. With all the history and fans, that alone would make me want to come here. I can’t speak for all the other guys in the NBA, but I wasn’t surprised at all that [Horford] would want to come here.

“Who wouldn’t want to be a part of an organization like this, with a coach like we have, and the type of guys that we have? Seeing how we are just growing every single year, improving every single year, I feel like every player would want to be a part of a process like this.”</span></div></div>

Get radio button value by the group

I have a bunch of radio button on my single page, and I want to get a value from the checked one
Here's my HTML Code
&lt;div class="row">
//first radio button group
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="1">&lt;br>1&lt;!--&lt;br>Awful-->&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="2">&lt;br>2&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="3">&lt;br>3&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="4">&lt;br>4&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="5">&lt;br>5&lt;!--&lt;br>Ok-->&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="6">&lt;br>6&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="7">&lt;br>7&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="8">&lt;br>8&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="9">&lt;br>9&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="10">&lt;br>10&lt;!--&lt;br>Incridible-->&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

I've tried using loop like this
var pertanyaan1 = 1;
        var isipertanyaan1 = 0;
        $("input[name=pertanyaan1]").each(function(){

            if($("input[name=pertanyaan1][value="+pertanyaan1+"]").prop("checked","checked"))
            {
                console.log($("input[name=pertanyaan1][value="+pertanyaan1+"]").prop("checked","checked"));
                isipertanyaan1 = pertanyaan1;
                // break();
            }
            // console.log(pertanyaan1);
            pertanyaan1++;
        });

but that code make the if useless.. The radio not filtered..
how to solve this ?

A:

No need to use loop to get selected Radio button value.
just use :checked
$("input[name=pertanyaan1]:checked").val();

$('button').click(function(){
  console.log($("input[name=pertanyaan1]:checked").val());
});
&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;div class="row">
//first radio button group
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="1">&lt;br>1&lt;!--&lt;br>Awful-->&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="2">&lt;br>2&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="3">&lt;br>3&lt;/div>
    &lt;div class="col-md-1 col-xs-1 col-sm-1 centerText" >&lt;input type="radio" name="pertanyaan1" value="4">&lt;br>4&lt;/div>

But until recently, it was very rare to see the behavior in wild animals.

MIKE BOSSLEY

Billie the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin liked to walk on water. She’d pump her tail vigorously back and forth, forcing her entire body out of the water, so she’d skim backwards along the surface as if she were moonwalking.

Mike Bossley, a researcher at the wildlife charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC), was the first to observe Billie performing the trick; he caught her doing it in the bays and estuaries around Adelaide, Australia, in the 1990s and early 2000s. At the time, it was common to see trained dolphins tail walk in marine parks. But Billie was wild.

“Tail walking in wild dolphins is indeed rare,” says Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University who studies dolphin behavior. “I have seen it only once in 32 years of observing wild dolphins.”

Bossley’s now interested in what the behavior reveals about how the animals learn from one another. Billie probably learned to tail walk during a brief stint in captivity, he says. She was born off the southern coast of Australia, then trapped in a polluted harbor near Adelaide in 1987 and taken to a dolphinarium. She was never trained to tail walk, but watched the five other dolphins there train for three weeks. She was then released back into the wild.

In 1995, Bossley spotted Billie tail-walking in Port River estuary, just north of Adelaide’s city center. “I was out in my red inflatable boat, and suddenly she appeared right beside the boat and did a tail walk circling around it only about 2 meters away,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. He was surprised to see Billie tail walking, he says, but didn’t realize the significance of the behavior at the time—that a cultural trend was emerging among wild bottlenose dolphins in the area.

That started to sink in as Bossley watched Billie tail walk multiple times over the next few years, and then spotted another wild dolphin, Wave, doing it too. “I became very excited when Wave started to tail walk as well because I then realized what was happening—the behavior was spreading through the dolphin community,” he says. Bossley wanted to document the behavior, so, that same year, he enlisted the help of citizen scientists. More than 30,000 hours of observation later, he and colleagues at WDC described 11 dolphins—six adult females and five juveniles of both sexes—doing the tail walk between 1995 and 2014 (Biol Lett 14:20180314, 2018).

MIKE BOSSLEY

Among adult dolphins, “it is unclear why only females appear to tail walk, and again, why only some of the local females tail walk,” Bossley says. But the observations provide an example of the impressive imitative skills of dolphins in general. “Dolphins are excellent mimics, both physically and acoustically,” Mann says. The results support this concept and are “also consistent with the general finding that dolphins learn such behaviors when they are young.”

Based on the data, Bossley and his colleagues suggest in the paper that the mimicry illustrated by the spread of tail walking behavior might help researchers understand how wild bottlenose dolphins in the area have learned to adopt a range of foraging behaviors, from beating cuttlefish with their snouts to catching fish in conch shells.

Mann, however, says she’s not convinced by this argument because, unlike foraging behavior, the tail walk has no obvious biological function. “The context of tail walking was not reported in the study,” she says. “Was the dolphin alone, in a group? What happened before and after the tail walk?” To be absolutely sure of the function of the behavior, much more context for each occurrence is needed, she says. Perhaps then it could reveal clues about other learned behaviors.

One possible explanation is that the animals have adopted tail walking as a signal of some sort. “The behavior could be used to show other dolphins that the tail walker is exuberant or capable, which could serve as either a sexual signal or one to improve the group cohesion of the pod,” says Bernd Würsig, a behavioral ecologist who studies whales and dolphins at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston and was not involved in the study. That said, “I do not believe the authors have indications for these [signals] in this case.”

Bossley agrees that there’s no evidence in their study that the behavior provides fitness benefits to the animals. “I think the behavior is arbitrary because I am unable to detect any pattern to its performance. It is sometimes done when other dolphins are present, sometimes alone,” he says. “It sometimes [accompanies] a change in behavior, for example from foraging to traveling, and sometimes it does not.”

Why would wild dolphins learn to do this trick if there’s no biological benefit? “Fun,” Würsig suggests. “Dolphins do quite a bit for enjoyment.”

Whatever the role of tail walking in wild dolphins, it could serve a purpose in guiding conservation decisions. “The behaviour was not produced at high rates until decades after it was originally introduced, showing that anthropogenic impacts on behaviour can last for decades within populations,” Bossley and his colleagues write in the paper. Those anthropogenic impacts have to be taken into consideration when developing conservation strategies, they argue.

Nevertheless, this particular behavior is slowly disappearing from the wild population. Billie died in 2009, and according to the team’s observations, tail walking peaked right after that, in 2010 and 2011, with 62 sightings of the behavior each year. Then it tapered off. There were only 7 sightings in 2014—the same year Wave passed away.

The behavior, it seemed, was a fad. “What surprised me in the story,” Würsig says, “is how very long it took for [tail walking] to manifest, and that it had rather a short life.”</span></div></div>

Studies of the relationship between creativity and specific reading disabilities have produced inconclusive results. We explored their relationship in a sample of 259 college students (age range: 17 to 38 years-old) from three Chilean universities. The students were tested on their verbal ability, creativity, and insight. A simple linear regression was performed on the complete sample, and on high- and low-achievement groups that were formed based on reading test scores. We observed a significant correlation in the total sample between outcomes on the verbal ability tasks, and on the creativity and insight tasks (range r =. 152 to r =. 356, ps &lt;.001). Scores on the reading comprehension and phonological awareness tasks were the best predictors of performance on creativity and insight tasks (range β = .315 to β = .155, ps &lt;.05). A comparison of the low- and high-scoring groups on verbal ability tasks yielded results to the same effect. These findings do not support the hypothesis that specific reading disability is associated with better performance on creative tasks. Instead, higher verbal ability was found to be associated with higher creativity and insight.</span></div></div>

Field Of The Invention
The present invention relates to windows used in conventional buildings such as houses and particularly to windows that open by pivoting outwardly from their frames.
2. Description Of The Prior Art And Objectives Of The Invention
With the recent increase in the crime rate, in certain populated areas more and more home owners have attempted to secure their dwelling and other buildings from unauthorized intrusions. Various types of security systems and alarms have been have been devised such as shown in the jalousie alarm system of U.S. Pat. No. 4,449,121 whereby a jalousie-type window is connected to an alarm system wherein a deflection of the alarm strut or shaft will cause electrical contact to be made thereby activating an audio alarm. Also, a rotatable saw-bar is included in the alarm strut which will prevent the alarm shaft from being removed or cut by sawing. Other types of securty locks, alarms and devices have been made for a variety of window types. However, such prior art devices usually have certain weakness and problems associated therewith. Also, in recent years changes have been made in building codes for windows to help protect buildings and their contents in adverse weather conditions such as during hurricanes, windstorms and the like.
With the aforesaid problems and conditions understood, the present invention was conceived and one of its objectives is to provide an awning window which can be easily installed by a building contractor and which will provide both burglar and weather protection.
It is another objective of present invention to provide an awning window which include a rotatable transparent panel with a J-shaped lip which will engage a lip receptacle attached to the frame upon closing.
It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide an awning window with an alarm strut having an anti-saw bar and having an alarm switch mechanism therein.
It is also an objective of the invention to provide an awning window with an alarm strut with a panel lip receptacle attached thereto.
It is also an objective of the present invention to provide an awning window having a window sill with a lip receptacle affixed thereto for engagement with the lowermost panel.
Various other objectives and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as the invention set forth in more detail below.</span></div></div>

"I remember going to school every day on the bus to St Austell from Truro and being fascinated by all the different houses built along the way. Looking back, that first interest in architecture was where it all began for me and when I left school nearly 50 years ago I resolved to become a surveyor. That goal was ultimately achieved and although now qualified as a Chartered Surveyor for many years I am best known as an estate agent having worked in the industry for 48 years.

Having spent the first 5 years in Launceston and Liskeard I returned to my home city of Truro and became property manager for a well known agricultural firm for the next 10 years. With Truro dominated by corporate agents I decided to open my own agency and took over premises in Cathedral Lane where my great grandfather had started business in 1876. I was local, a Cornishman, fiercely proud of both Truro and maintaining the Cornish identity and passionate about “planning” and the built environment. Many businesses have come and gone but 30 years later I am still here.

Agents are much maligned and in many respects they have been largely responsible for the bad reputation that exists. As a firm we have tried to maintain and portray a very professional ideology and meant in its true form being governed in all our day to day dealings by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. We are certainly less vocal than many other agents on what we have achieved over the years but the reality is we have achieved more than most and we continue to strive. I have always believed that recommendation is your best form of instruction and never take anyone for granted. It is said that, in business, loyalty is a diminishing quality with the general public and whilst sometimes bitterly disappointed by clients actions you can also be boosted by a clients complete trust and moral ethics.

Nowadays I am joined by 3 partners (all remarkably with a similar Cornish background) and with a total workforce of 16 I am proud that the ethos of the firm remains exactly the same. We are here to be of service, maintain professional standards but be understanding of your clients needs and do your best. With technology the world is constantly changing but there is still a real need for property professionals and Philip Martin will be here for many years to come.

Having sold and managed property from the banks of the Tamar to the tip of St. Just in Penwith we have an intimate knowledge of the county. Indeed WE KNOW CORNWALL, WE KNOW PROPERTY AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO."</span></div></div>

CHICAGO — A Lincoln Park nightclub denied entry to a trans person who was wearing a dress, the person said.

Jay Graber, who identifies as transgender and uses the pronouns "they" and "them," said they were turned away because they wore a dress while trying to get into PRYSM, 1543 N. Kingsbury Ave., on Dec. 30.

Representatives of the club did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Graber paid $40 for tickets in advance and went to the club with a friend named Lux on Dec. 30, they said. Once there, Graber said an employee told them the two couldn't enter because Graber was wearing a dress.

When Graber said that was discrimination, the employee instead said Graber couldn't enter because they were wearing sneakers instead of dress shoes, Graber said. The employee told Graber they could enter if they returned with dress shoes, Graber said.

Graber and Lux went back to an apartment and Graber changed into dress shoes. They returned to the club and the first employee scanned the pair's tickets — marking Graber's as "male" — and motioned them toward the club entrance, Graber said.

But that's when another employee, a door manager, stopped the two, Graber said.

That employee "told us 'there was no way in h--- he would be letting a dude in a dress into his nightclub,'" Graber said. The employee also said Graber "didn't fit the dress code," Graber said.

Graber and Lux said they wanted to speak to a supervisor about ticket refunds, but were "laughed at, misgendered and ridiculed" by the employees, Graber said.

A supervisor eventually spoke with the door manager, Graber said, and Graber held up a receipt and showed the supervisor the dress. The supervisor "made a disgusted face," nodded his head no and went into the club, Graber said.

At the same time, several men and women — including women wearing dresses — were let into the club, some of them for free, Graber said.

Graber asked the employees what was needed to wear to get into the club and explained they had paid for the tickets, several rides between home and the club and they wanted to see the artist who was performing, Graber said. The employees laughed and ignored Graber and Lux, Graber said.

After waiting outside for 45 minutes, the employee who had scanned Graber's ticket approached and said he wished he could have let Graber and Lux in but that "he had been told that we would not be let in no matter what I was wearing," Graber said. The employee then asked Graber and Lux to leave.

As Graber left, they saw a person named Jazmine, who is agender and also uses "they" and "them" pronouns. Graber, Lux and Jazmine spoke and left to go to a LGBTQ-friendly club in Lakeview.

Jazmine, who has shaved, green hair, said entry was denied because of Jazmine's "general look." An employee said Jazmine's pants were joggers — a loose type of pants usually worn for exercise — and were not allowed, though Jazmine was not wearing joggers.

A friend had been trying to convince bouncers to let Jazmine into the club, Jazmine said, but once Jazmine spoke with Graber and Lux the employees "weren't having it."

"I have never had any issues until last weekend" getting into clubs, Jazmine said.

Graber posted about the incident on PRYSM's Facebook several times and messaged the club, but the organization has not responded except to ask for Graber's contact information several days ago, Graber said.

Others have shared Graber's posts and have written posts of their own on PRYSM's Facebook page, criticizing the club. The organization has not publicly responded to them.

Jazmine contacted the performer the three had been trying to see, a French artist named Madeon, on social media. The performer apologized and said he would try to ensure the three received refunds and free tickets to his next show in Chicago.

Brian Johnson, CEO of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Illinois, said being denied entry to a public accommodation because of one's perceived gender identity "seems like a pretty blatant violation of the Chicago and the Illinois human rights ordinances."

Equality Illinois would encourage anyone with a claim of discrimination to contact the Chicago Human Relations Commission if the incident happens in the city, Johnson said.

Ken Gunn, deputy commissioner of the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, said victims of possible discrimination have 180 days to file a complaint with the commission. Once a complaint is filed, the commission will investigate the case and, if there is "substantial evidence of discrimination," the case goes to a hearing.

If the complainant prevails, the business that discriminated against the complainant can face a fine up to $1,000, Gunn said. The complainant can also go to court to receive damages.

L'énergie produite par les dalles photovoltaïques permettent d’éclairer, en journée, la portion de piste cyclable qui passe sous un pont, à quelques mètres de là. — F.Pouliquen/20Minutes

Depuis janvier, le long du canal de l’Ourcq, 56 m² de dalles photovoltaïques posées sur la piste cyclable produisent l’énergie qui va permettre d’éclairer le passage sous un pont non loin de là. Et quand il y a du surplus, il est vendu et réinjecté dans le réseau.

La technologique est développée par Wattway, filiale du groupe Colas, déjà derrière la route solaire inaugurée dans l’Orne en décembre 2016. Près de trois ans plus tard, l’expérimentation rencontre des difficultés, de l’aveu même de Wattway.

L’entreprise n’abandonne pas pour autant cette idée de produire de l’énergie à même la route, mais privilégie désormais les projets de plus petites échelles comme celui de Bobigny. Une bonne idée ?

Une piste cyclable pour favoriser la mobilité douce… et pourquoi pas aussi pour produire de l’énergie ? C’est en tout cas l’idée creusée à Bobigny (Seine-Saint-Denis). Le long du canal de l’Ourcq, la première piste cycliste solaire a été mise en service en janvier dernier et a été inaugurée ce lundi par le département de Seine-Saint-Denis.

Le tronçon n’est pas bien grand. Les dalles photovoltaïques sont alignées sur 27 mètres de long et couvrent une surface totale de 56 mètres carrés. Pas de quoi couvrir toute la largeur du chemin de halage, si bien que bon nombre de cyclistes passent à côté des dalles, sans sembler les remarquer.

Éclairer sous un pont… et pourquoi pas plus ?

Il n’empêche, cette piste solaire cyclable s’acquitte de sa tâche. En sortie de piste, un panneau affiche en instantanée les performances des dalles photovoltaïques. Dont celui de la production d’énergie cumulée depuis sa mise en service, en janvier dernier. Soit 2.996 kilowatts/heure, l’équivalent de 440 jours de consommation d’électricité (hors chauffage) d’un foyer.

Cette énergie permet d’éclairer en journée la portion de piste cyclable qui passe sous le pont à quelques mètres de là. « C’était une demande régulière que nous remontaient les cyclistes, raconte Stéphane Troussel, le président du conseil départemental de Seine-Saint-Denis. Cette partie était très sombre et créait des contrastes importants au point d’éblouir les cyclistes. » Voilà pour la mission prioritaire des dalles photovoltaïques. « Le surplus d’énergie alimente également une batterie qui permet d’éclairer sous ce même pont la nuit, poursuit Etienne Gaudin, directeur de Wattway, filiale de l’entreprise Colas (groupe Bouygues) qui développe cette technologie. Quand cette batterie est pleine et qu’il y a encore du surplus – ce qui est souvent arrivé cet été –, il est vendu à Enedis et réinjecté dans le réseau Enedis. »

Dans la lignée de la route solaire en Normandie

Qu’on ne se trompe pas pour autant : cette piste cycliste solaire, qui a nécessité un investissement de 118.000 euros, coûte plus cher qu’elle ne rapporte au département. « L’enjeu n’est pas là, glisse Stéphane Troussel. Dans un territoire très urbanisé comme le nôtre, il y a des solutions plus simples pour éclairer un pont. Mais c’était le terrain idéal pour une telle démonstration et l’occasion de montrer notre attachement au développement des énergies renouvelables. »

Cette expérimentation n’est pas sans rappeler la première route solaire au monde inaugurée en grande pompe en décembre 2016, en Normandie. Et derrière laquelle on retrouve déjà Wattway. L’installation pilote alignait quelque 2.800 m² de panneaux photovoltaïques sur un kilomètre d’une route départementale à Tourouvre-au-Perche (Orne). Wattaway affichait l’ambition de fournir l’équivalent de la consommation annuelle de l’éclairage public d’une ville de 5.000 habitants. Et Ségolène Royal, alors ministre de l’Environnement, celle de déployer 1.000 km de ces panneaux solaires sur route d’ici à cinq ans.

« Pas un fiasco » pour Wattway

Mais deux ans et demi plus tard, cette route solaire normande fait pâle figure. Le Monde, dans un article paru le 22 juillet, évoque sans détour un « fiasco », « ni efficace énergétiquement, ni rentable économiquement ». Le quotidien évoque aussi des joins en lambeaux, des panneaux solaires qui se décollent de la chaussée, des éclats qui émaillent la résine protégeant les cellules photovoltaïques ou encore une portion d’une centaine de mètres trop abîmée pour être réparée. A cela s’ajoute le bruit des véhicules sur ce revêtement dont se plaignent les riverains.

Etienne Gaudin ne nie pas les difficultés rencontrées dans l’Orne, mais récuse le terme « fiasco ». « C’est une première expérience qui continue, commence-t-il. Il n’est plus significatif, aujourd’hui, en termes de production d’énergie, notamment parce que les dalles photovoltaïques sont anciennes. Elles datent de 2016, alors que nous avons beaucoup évolué depuis. Nous sommes en discussions avec le département de l’Orne pour les remplacer. Quoi qu’il en soit, ce premier site nous a aussi permis déjà d’expérimenter un grand nombre de technologies. C’est grâce à lui que nous sommes aujourd’hui en mesure de faire une piste cyclable solaire à Bobigny. »

La priorité donnée à de plus petits projets

Il n’empêche, Wattway évoque désormais ces routes solaires « comme des projets à mener sur le long terme » et privilégie en attendant des réalisations à plus petites échelles. « Nous avons aujourd’hui 45 expérimentations en cours dans le monde », précise Etienne Gaudin. Elles sont de deux types. « Les premières visent à permettre à des bâtiments [école, mairie, supermarché] d’être à énergie positive [qui produit plus d’énergie qu’il en consomme], reprend le directeur de Wattway. Nos dalles photovoltaïques sont par exemple installées sur les allées piétonnes aux abords des bâtiments et complètent très souvent des premières installations de panneaux photovoltaïques sur les toits. »

La deuxième configuration est celle, donc, de la piste cyclable solaire de Bobigny. « Sur ces installations, l’objectif est d’alimenter en énergie des équipements à proximité, reprend Etienne Gaudin. Cela peut être de l’éclairage public à Bobigny, mais aussi une caméra de surveillance du trafic au milieu d’un rond-point à Montpellier, ou des bornes de recharges pour véhicules électriques… »

Ces dalles photovoltaïques ne sont pas toujours la solution la plus pertinente. Elles ont notamment un rendement moindre que les panneaux photovoltaïques installés sur les toits ou en façade des bâtiments, que l’on peut incliner de façon optimale pour capter les rayons du soleil. « En revanche, lorsque le point de raccordement au réseau est éloigné de l’équipement que l’on veut éclairer ou lorsque le risque que les panneaux photovoltaïques soient vandalisés, notre solution a sa carte à jouer », estime Etienne Gaudin.

« Un gadget »

Marc Jedliczka n’est pas convaincu. Le vice-président du Réseau pour la transition énergétique (Cler) a du mal à voir dans ces dalles photovoltaïques installées au sol autre chose que « des gadgets » pour lesquels « on jette de l’argent public par les fenêtres ». « Un panneau photovoltaïque produit quand il est au soleil, lance-t-il. Si des voitures et des vélos passent dessus et génèrent de l’ombre, ça marche nettement moins. »

Surtout, pour lui la priorité est bien plus « de permettre le développement des solutions éprouvées, plus simples et aux rendements meilleurs ». Marc Jedliczka évoque notamment les installations de panneaux photovoltaïques sur les toits et façades des bâtiments. « En France, il y a d’un côté les petits projets, ceux des particuliers qui équipent leur maison, et de l’autre les grands parcs au sol que développent les énergéticiens, résume-t-il. Entre les deux, au niveau des écoles, des mairies, des immeubles de bureaux, des ombrières de parking, il y a encore trop peu de projets menés, notamment parce qu’il n’y a de tarifs d’achats [un prix d’achat garanti] que pour les projets inférieurs à 100 kWc [kilowatt crête, la puissance de votre installation photovoltaïque]. C’est trop bas. Nous demandons qu’ils soient étendus jusqu’à 500 kWc. »</span></div></div>

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) participate in many cellular processes and play a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle and transcription processes. Recently, CDK12 was identified as a key factor orchestrating transcription of genes, such as BRCA1, ATM, ATR, FANCI and FANCD2, which are involved in the DNA-damage response pathway. Importantly, inhibition of function of these genes commonly leads to induction of genomic instability followed by cancer development, but the precise contribution of CDK12 to these processes is to be unveiled. Nevertheless, several mutations affecting function of CDK12 were already identified in a variety of tumors of different origin (ovary, breast, prostate, intestine) making tumors sensitive to cytostatics promot-ing DNA damage (platin derivatives, alkylating regimens) and inhibitors of DNA repair (PARP inhibitors). Such an effect has been already observed in the model of high grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Thus, CDK12 is becoming a potential therapeutic target of drugs causing synthetic lethality in these cells. Our review summarizes most recent information about CDK12 function in cancer and discusses potential use of CDK12 in clinics.</span></div></div>

Issue with using ProtectContent - Spreadsheet gear

I am trying to make a selected cells of my excel to be editable and rest to be readonly.
Following is my code, I am trying to set the Locked property for the specified rows to be "False" and trying to protect the sheet
excl.WorkSheet(0).Range[0, myColumns.Count, rowCount + 2, myColumns.Count].Locked = false; // Unlock cells to not make them read-only by ProtectContents
excl.WorkSheet(0).ProtectContents = true; //Make all the locked cells read only

Say rowCount = 5, I would like to have the entire rows between 0-6 to be editable, but the rest of the fields in the workbook to be read-only.
But, the entire sheet ends up being protected rather than the cells that are locked only.
Can anyone please help me fix this

A:

I did this and was able to achieve what I wanted, but I am eager to know any other way to do this as well
  IRange rows = excl.WorkSheet(0).Cells[rowStart, myColumns.Count].EntireRow;
  rows.Locked = false; 
  excl.WorkSheet(0).ProtectContents = true;

Having trouble parsing Json with PHP

I have an android app that sends a json string to my server and it is formatted as follows:
{"drink_name":"testing","phone_number":"5555555555"}

When I use the command: SELECT * FROM orders, it shows that blank entries were inserted into the table.
I think my issue is arising from my PHP script (mainly because I am new to PHP).
Am I parsing the json correctly?
Below is the script that I wrote.
&lt;?php 
$handle = mysql_connect('localhost',USERNAME,PASSWORD); 
if($handle==false) 
{ 
die('No database connection'); 
} 

$db=mysql_select_db('r2bar2');

$json = file_get_contents('php://input');
$obj = json_decode($json);

mysql_query("INSERT INTO orders (phone_number, drink_name) 
VALUES ('".$obj->{'phone_number'}."', '".$obj->{'drink_name'}."')");
mysql_close($handle);
?>

EDIT:
Here is my Android code if it is any help.
protected void sendJson(final String phnNmbr, final String drink) {
    Thread t = new Thread(){
        public void run() {
            Looper.prepare(); //For Preparing Message Pool for the child Thread
            HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
            HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(client.getParams(), 10000); //Timeout Limit
            HttpResponse response;
            JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
            try{
                HttpPost post = new HttpPost("http://kubie.dyndns-home.com/R2Bar2/sendOrder.php");
                json.put("phone_number", phnNmbr);
                json.put("drink_name", drink);
                StringEntity se = new StringEntity( "orders: " + json.toString());  
                se.setContentEncoding(new BasicHeader(HTTP.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json"));
                post.setEntity(se);
                response = client.execute(post);
                /*Checking response */
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), json.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                if(response!=null){
                    InputStream in = response.getEntity().getContent(); //Get the data in the entity
                }
            }
            catch(Exception e){
                e.printStackTrace();
                //createDialog("Error", "Cannot Estabilish Connection");
            }
            Looper.loop(); //Loop in the message queue
        }
    };
    t.start();      
}

A:

I figured out what I was doing wrong. It seems as though I was passing in a raw data type. In order to parse the string, I used the following:
$obj = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"));

mysql_query("INSERT INTO orders (phone_number, drink_name)
VALUES ('".$obj->{'phone_number'}."', '".$obj->{'drink_name'}."')");

Thanks everyone for your suggestions.

"In-place" MSD radix sort, stack space, and Stack Overflow's

I'm really confused the "in-place" MSD radix sort algorithm:

Each bin is then processed recursively using the next digit, until all digits have been used for sorting.

I'm confused because it seems to me that recursion implies O(n) stack space, where n is the length (in number of bits) of the longest string, right?
It seems to me that the only way to avoid a stack overflow is to use heap space -- but then the algorithm is no longer "in-place" by any definition.
How, then, can in-place MSD radix sort be possibly done in-place?

A:

I think that the terminology "in-place MSD radix sort" is a bit misleading because, as you noted, it's not an in-place algorithm under a strict definition of "in-place." The "in-place" terminology here most likely refers to the fact that, unlike LSD radix sort, the algorithm doesn't require an auxiliary array to temporarily store the elements from the original input array.
You are correct that the space usage of MSD radix sort is proportional to the number of digits in the largest input number. For notational simplicity, let's have n be the length of the input array and U be the largest number in the array. The runtime of MSD radix sort is then O(n log U), since the number of digits in the number U is O(log U). O(log U) is a very, very slowly-growing function. For reference, the number of atoms in the universe is about 1080, which is about 2240. Therefore, if you're sorting numbers that were generated by any physical process, the recursion depth will be at most 240, which while large is definitely manageable.
If you're sorting really large numbers - say, numbers with thousands and thousands of bits - then you're right to be worried about blowing out the stack. However, I'd argue that it's extremely unlikely that this would happen if you have a good implementation of MSD radix sort. There's a standard optimization in quicksort - which looks a lot like MSD radix sort - where instead of making two branching recursive calls, you make one recursive call on the smaller of the two ranges to sort, then recycle the stack frame from the initial call to sort the larger range. (This is essentially a tail-call elimination). Now, suppose you apply this to MSD radix sort. Since every newly-created stack frame works on the smaller of the two ranges to sort, you can guarantee that each new stack frame has half as many elements in it than the previous stack frame. As a result, the maximum depth that the stack can reach is O(log n) - not O(log U). In order for this to blow out your stack, you'd need a truly astronomically large input array, regardless of the stack size.
In summary: you're right, the algorithm is not in place. However, due to the fact that the stack depth is O(log U) in a naive implementation and O(log n) in an optimized implementation, you shouldn't need to worry about this unless you had a naive implementation and truly colossally huge inputs.

Jalan-Jalan and LeQuire Gallery’s Art &amp; Antiques holiday event

LeQuire Gallery and Jalan-Jalan Antiques have teamed up to host a unique holiday exhibition and shopping experience 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday. Presenting “Stone-Flesh-Paint,” an exhibition by Canadian, New York-based artist Maggie Rose, the Nashville retailers will display the selection of large and small scale paintings throughout Jalan-Jalan’s showroom of rare, museum-quality Indonesian antiques.

Rose primarily explores expression, the color and texture of flesh, and her paintings often feature ethereal portraits of people, bovines and clothing bathed in natural light. Her new series of paintings are inspired by the idealized sculptures and friezes of classical antiquity.

The exhibition will move from Jalan-Jalan to LeQuire Gallery on Dec. 12, where it will remain on view through Jan. 20. Any artworks purchased in December can be taken home immediately.

If your Facebook newsfeed is like mine, you’ve probably seen a bunch of posts that say something like this one I saw this morning:

In honor of someone who means a lot to me…I’m going to say goodbye to some of you…… now I’m watching the ones who will have the time to read this post until the end. This is a little test, just to see who reads and who shares without reading!

These posts are like nails on a blackboard to me. There are a couple reasons. First, they misunderstand how the newsfeed works. Not all your friends see all your posts. So you can’t judge people by whether they respond—you can’t tell if they’ve seen it at all. Second, although the wording of each version of this sort of post varies, in most cases it implies “I read carefully. Some of you, though, are not being careful.” Can’t posters of this meme feel the smugness of the tone? It implies, “If you don’t read my long, wordy Facebook post all the way to the end, then you are a thoughtless and careless person.” Is that what you really meant to say? Third, the writer is imposing an obligation on his/her readers. Kurt Luther comments, “People’s timeless desire to impose chain letter-like obligations on others has made a smooth transition to the new medium.” Public Service Announcement: Please don’t post this meme.

I think that I understand the better impulse behind the meme. The poster is saying, “I have doubts about whether the connections we are forging on this website are meaningful. I am yearning for a deeper sense of connectedness to people I care about.” I like that impulse. So here’s my challenge: How can we express that desire for more meaningful connections without this obnoxious meme? If you have ideas, leave me a comment! (And thanks for reading to the end….)</span></div></div>

As I'm sure most idol fans or just Hello!Project fans already know, a short PV preview was released for Morning Musume's upcoming new single Maji Desu ka Ska. This is the second PV preview we've gotten and the second time the fan's reactions have been split. Of course the reactions are split for all PVs. Opinions differ, personal preferences are taken into consideration, and quite honestly you can't please everyone. Despite, how hard you try some fans will always be disappointed by a PV due to their own high expectations. But, when I saw the PV previews for Maji Desu ka Ska I was impressed. I was honestly impressed. The song is upbeat, the dance is simple but high energy and cute, the outfits are vibrant, vivid, and cute. But I still found that a lot of Morning Musume fans still thought the PV was terrible. Because it follows the same formula that Morning Musume PVs have followed lately.

But then I started to think, why do fans hate this formula so much? Do they not realize this is how Morning Musume has always made their PVs? If they haven't, were they following the same group as I was? Morning Musume is my absolute favorite idol group. I follow them the closest, and I critic them the closest. When I dislike something they are doing I strongly voice my opinion about it. But it seems fans are negatively voicing their opinions just to voice their opinion. If you go back and watch all of Morning Musume's PVs they all follow the same formula. Close-up shot, dance shot, and then random scenes of the girls when no one is singing, which is usually a mixture of close-ups or full body shots.

Morning Musume has hardly ever made a PV with an actual story line, or something else going on besides this formula. I can literally only name a handful of Morning Musume PVs that aren't like this. And those PV are: Aruiteru, The Peace, Namida Tomaranai Houkago, Roman My Dear Boy, I Wish, Morning Musume no Hyokkori Hyoutan-jima, Do It! Now, Mr. Moonligh ~Ai no Big Band~, and Koko ni Iruzee.

You could also argue that Egao Yes Nude, Go Girl ~Koi no Victory~, Naichau Kamo, Souda! We're Alive, and Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii jan count as well. But I don't count rolling in a bed, saying suki up-close, crying up close, jumping in heigh, or breaking fake glass as a story line.

I'm sure a lot of people reading this find that hard to believe. Since a lot of fans are waiting for them to make interesting PVs again. But all of their PVs have been the same. Even if you're consciously unaware of that fact. But make no mistake, Morning Musume follows that formula and so do most idol groups. And when I say you might not be consciously aware of this, I mean because directors have tricks to make a seemingly boring/low budget PV look more exciting or entertaining.

Now, that might be them having their close-ups in a more exciting setting then the rest of the PV.

Showing more shots of the setting/having them look like they are doing something. That eludes to a storyline without actually establishing one.

Have more than one shot of the dance. Seeing the same dance in different outfits adds the illusion that you're seeing something new, even though you're not.

Have them do something more interesting during their close-ups. Just because they are spinning and not standing doesn't make it less of just another close-up.

Have them wear more than one outfit, having another outfit makes the PV more dynamic. It also makes it look like it has a high budget and fans will often over look the lack of a storyline if there is more than one outfit.

Now, all of this might have been visually appealing and exciting but that doesn't make it a storyline. A storyline has dialogue that lets you know what's going on in it. Or it silently follows a storyline. Like falling in love, going to the beach, committing suicide, or just about anything really. Something that actually tells you a story while you watch it. Apparently Morning Musume fans want of all of Momusu's PVs to be Michael Jackson's Thriller video. But aside from AKB48, most idols aren't making PVs like this. Name the last idol PV you actually saw that had a storyline. I mean like the ones you see in American music videos. I honestly can't think of any. Within or outside of H!P.

Then if the storyline isn't a problem, what is? If you take the storyline out of a PV you're left only with the other pieces. Which are the dance shots and close-ups. Which are the PVs that JE and some 48 groups and subgroups are making, as well as lesser know idol groups. But I hardly ever see any of those fans complain. And I have to wonder if it's because the fans like that formula, or is it that these groups are so popular and on top of their genres (male and female idols separately of course) that they have nothing to complain about? I'm going to go with the second one.

Here are some idol PVs that are the same caliber as Morning Musume's PVs.

KAT-TUN-Ultimate Wheels

Hey! Say! JUMP-Arigatou Sekai no Doko ni itemo

SDN48-GAGAGA

Idoling!!!-Eve

Canary Club-Daisukki

Not Yet-Shuumatsu Not Yet

AKB48-Chance no Junban

And of course there are plenty more. But these are just the ones I could think of on the top of my head because they are recent.

But despite all this, it always seems like Morning Musume are judged more harshly. That Morning Musume is the only group making bad PVs. I don't understand the bias between fans. And I don't understand how harshly PVs are judged. I understand that sometimes a PV is so awful you have to complain. But every single Momusu PV gets judged harshly. No matter how much better it is than a previous PV or how similar other idol PVs are. It makes absolutely no sense to me. I might like H!P and JE the most but when their PVs suck I'm the first one to say it. And when their PVs don't suck I'm there praising it. These are idol PVs, and to expect them to be a masterpiece is ridiculous.

It seems like fans are also judging Momusu too harshy is because they have been around for a long time and are dwindling a bit. And hating on them is the cool thing to do in the idol fandom. But what about Arashi? They hardly ever release interesting PVs or ones that break the standard formula. But they have been around nearly as long as Momusu and sell significantly higher than them. And yet rabid Arashi fangirls hardly complain about anything they do.

I don't know, this is basically just a rant. And I'm sure I'll get a lot of comments telling me I don't know what I'm talking about. Or that they are an unbiased fan, so that in some way means all fans are unbiased. I think I might actually be one of the few truly unbiased fans out there. And I know that sounds extremely arrogant, but sometimes it does feel that way. I just really wanted to get all of this off of my chest. So, what does everyone think? Thoughts, opinions, disagreements. I'd love to hear other fan's inputs.

comments:

From what I observed, I think only fans outside of Japan are unhappy about the PV. The wotas are not complaining about the PV, it's the costumes the girls are wearing that they're having trouble with. LOL

I wasn't impressed that much with Chance no Junban or Not Yet's PVs either. I don't Kat-Tun's PV was close to Morning Musume's PV; they used some really cool editing. Now for me, I critique when I am just not impressed/ when I am bored. I'm not checking things off and I've even mentioned how impressed I've been with Momoclo's PVs considering how low budget, but fun they are.

I just like it when they are visually appealing and make me like the song more. Like: Nanchatte Ren'ai and Shou ga nai Yume Oibito. More outfits, interesting angles and camera shots, nice backdrops. If I like the song more after watching the PV then I like it. My main problem lately is that it is obviously formulated, which means they probably are doing a poor job because I am noticing that. (Arashi's Lotus uses that formula but I don't think about it while watching it.) The outfits and backgrounds have also been hit or miss for me. Plus, I might be subconsciously comparing AKB's and MM's PVs, and AKB's PVs have been really impressive lately.

I totally understand what you mean. Who else would not compare if there other good quality PVs out there. However, I do not think UFA gave Musume enough attention to allocate more budget to the production of the PVs. I can recall a few Kpop PV that are so much better quality and obviously have a better budget.

So rather to say it's formulated, I'm assuming that this is just the best the creative team can do for Musume with what little that they were allocated for. (^q^)

@Ryo: That's usually how it is. Foreign fans seem to make a big deal over things that Japanese fans don't even think twice about.Am I the only one who loves the outfits? They are like Naichau Kamo mixed with Maji Bomber. I love them! XD

I also understand about comparing if there are other good PVs out there, but for the most part idol PV are pretty much exactly the same. That's why I posted so many examples from different agencies. Hardly any other idols are making better PVs but it seems like Momusu is always judged the harshest.

Their are several reasons why Kpop PVs are better than Jpop PVs. But that's neither here nor there.

That might be true to an extent, but I think it's more beyond that. Other H!P fans said C-ute's Aitai Lonely Christmas and Dance de Bakoon, and Berryz Koubou's Heroine ni Narou Ka were amazing PVs. But they were nearly the same format as Momusu's were. For some reason Momusu is just judged the most.

@Mina: I wasn't that impressed with Chance no Junban or Ultimate Wheels, but I LOVED Shuumatsu Not Yet. Yes, it was simple but I thought it was energetic and fun. Much how I feel about Maji Desu ka Ska.That's when I critique also. But it seems a lot of fans are just way too harsh about Momusu for no reason. I agree on that. Momoiro Clover's PVs are usually amazing. But that's because they follow a storyline.

But more outfits and different angles don't really add anything to the PV, and are just are the same formula. That's what I was trying to say in my post. No matter how much camera effects a PV has it's still following the formula most fans claim to hate.I also think that, that makes a PV more dynamic and interesting. But most fans still complain. But if they are complaining about that, and Morning Musume has ALWAYS made PVs like that, I don't understand what they want or are expecting from PVs.I think they've always been obviously formated. I think it's impossible to not notice that they were. Watching Lotus you completely notice that formula. I mean it's basically the Monster PV in different outfits and backdrop. Arashi's PVs are worse then Momusu's. Lately their PVs have just been them standing. Like in Dear Snow, Hatenai Sora, and To Be Free. Yet, hardly anyone complains. Arashi fans are really intense. XD

The outfits and backgrounds are always a hit or miss for me too. Like in Onna to Otoko no Lullaby Game. I hated the outfits, but I still kinda liked the PV. I don't really compare PVs unless they are weraing similar outfits, are doing similar effects, or have a similar backdrop. Beyond that I don't compare. AKB48's PVs have always been really impressive. They make the best idol PVs out there, in my opinion. They always have a storyline and are always fun to watch. I also really like Watarirouka Hashiritai's PVs. Valentine Kiss is one of my favorite PVs of the last couple of months. It's really adorable.

The main problem lies with us foreign fans as the people above have said. I think we are so used to seeing the high budget videos from American or world renown artists that we somehow expect that from MM as well. I think that a lot of MM fans somehow regard the group as being above the rest of the idols and therefore don't understand why their videos don't stand out from the crowd. I think everyone's waiting for some sort of shocking Lady Gaga moment from MM. They'll just have to make do with Berryz Gaga themed pv instead. lol.

That's definitely a main factor as well. I don't think foreign fans realize that American artist can spend half a million on a music video, and Japanese idols probably don't get any where near that much.I don't see why fans would regard them higher than any other groups. Maybe because they've been around longer, but beyond that I can't fathom why.Lol. Morning Musume is probably never going to make better music videos. Even at the peak of their popularity, their videos weren't all that amazing.

I would say that you're still a biased fan though, since you are defending MM which means your biased, just in their favor and not against them.

I don't think you need a super high budget in order to make a nice PV, and it would be nice if MM's PVs were more creative tbh. Souda we're alive is my favorite MM single, and even though the PV is stupid, at least it shows the girls doing different things and posing and being random and silly while doing the same old close up/dance shot formula. I liked Maji Desu ka Suka PV, but I feel like what people miss is the more relaxed feeling old PVs had or they want something a little more aesthetically appealing, like new angles and interesting backdrops and composition just so it doesn't look half assed (c-ute's shiny hotpant song (sorry, I don't remember its name) video featured the same dance shot/close up thing plus a chair and an apple, and it even recycled the backdrop from OOLG but people liked it because it had better takes and it wasn't as simplistic)

I would say I am slightly biased against them. But not in the sense that I think they are superior. More in the sense that I see how great they are, and wish everyone else saw it too. However, I don't think this post is biased at all. I'm just pointing out how people seem to judge Momusu's simple PVs harshly. But when other idol groups release simple PVs no one says anything. I also want to point out that I love most of the example PVs. The only PVs I didn't like are KAT-TUN's, Canary Clubs', and Hey! Say! JUMP's.

I agree you don't need a high budget to make a great PV, and that Momusu's PVs lately lack creativity. Because they honestly do. Souda We're Alive is actually one of my least favorite single. But I do love the PV because of how random and fun it is. I usually like PVs that are silly, fun, and energetic. I don't even really care what the set looks like if the PV is itself is fun. See, I would personally hate more relaxed PVs. I'm just not into them. Because with more relaxed PVs I seem to focus on the set and dance more. Which almost laways turn out to be horrible. Shiny hot pants song, is the greatest way I've ever heard the song described. It's Kiss Me Aishiteru, btw. And I actually didn't like that PV at all. XD The girls looked pretty but the PV was too simple. So simple I didn't even bother writing a PV review about it. >&lt;</span></div></div>

Dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.


Milton Sylvester Currie, Appellant Pro Se. Gretchen C.F. Shappert,
Assistant United States Attorney, Charlotte, North Carolina, for

Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
See Local Rule 36(c).
PER CURIAM:

     Milton Sylvester Currie seeks to appeal the district court’s

order denying his motion filed under 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255 (West Supp.

2001).   We have reviewed the record and the district court’s opin-

ion and find no reversible error.    Accordingly, we deny a certif-

icate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of

the district court. United States v. Currie, Nos. CR-98-289-V; CA-

00-157-V (W.D.N.C. July 5, 2001).    We dispense with oral argument

because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in

the materials before the court and argument would not aid the

decisional process.




                                                          DISMISSED

Hypoxia causes mitochondrial cristae widening, enabled by the ~20% degradation of Mic60/mitofilin, with concomitant clustering of the MICOS complex, reflecting the widening of crista junctions (outlets) (Plecitá-Hlavatá et al. FASEB J., 2016 30:1941-1957). Attempting to accelerate metabolism by the addition of membrane-permeant dimethyl-2-oxoglutarate (dm2OG) to HepG2 cells pre-adapted to hypoxia, we found cristae narrowing by transmission electron microscopy. Glycolytic HepG2 cells, which downregulate hypoxic respiration, instantly increased respiration with dm2OG. Changes in intracristal space (ICS) morphology were also revealed by 3D super-resolution microscopy using Eos-conjugated ICS-located lactamase-β. Cristae topology was resolved in detail by focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). The spatial relocations of key cristae-shaping proteins were indicated by immunocytochemical stochastic 3D super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM), while analyzing inter-antibody-distance histograms: i) ATP-synthase dimers exhibited a higher fraction of shorter inter-distances between bound F1-α primary Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated antibodies, indicating cristae narrowing. ii) Mic60/mitofilin clusters (established upon hypoxia) decayed, restoring isotropic random Mic60/mitofilin distribution (a signature of normoxia). iii) outer membrane SAMM50 formed more focused clusters. Less abundant fractions of higher ATP-synthase oligomers of hypoxic samples on blue-native electrophoresis became more abundant fractions at the high dm2OG load and at normoxia. This indicates more labile ATP-synthase dimeric rows established at crista rims upon hypoxia, strengthened at normoxia or dm2OG-substrate load. Hypothetically, the increased Krebs substrate load stimulates the cross-linking/strengthening of rows of ATP-synthase dimers at the crista rims, making them sharper. Crista narrowing ensures a more efficient coupling of proton pumping to ATP synthesis. We demonstrated that cristae morphology changes even within minutes.</span></div></div>

Carolina Alexandra Falkholt, with the pseudonym Blue, born March 4, 1977 in Gothenburg, is a Swedish artist, graffiti writer and musician. Sometimes she uses her own coined term grafitta, to describe her art. It is a play with the two words graffiti and fitta, the latter means "pussy" in Swedish but also with a Swedish grammatical habit of setting a gender to work titles where an "a" denotes female role.

Biography 
Carolina Falkholt grew up in Dals Långed, Dalsland, Sweden. As a teenager, she moved to Stockholm to go to the waldorf school Kristofferskolan. At the same time she began painting graffiti under the pseudonym Blue. By the mid-1990s, she moved to New York City. There, as the only Swedish artist, she became a member of the two crews The Fantastic Partners and Hardcore Chickz. She worked with graffiti writers such as Sento and Lady Pink while making paintings around New York for the record company Rawkus to earn a living. Around the turn of the century, she was one of Sweden's most famous graffiti writers. After four years In New York, she moved back to Sweden and settled in Gothenburg where she is active today.

Artistic practice 
In addition to spray paint and drawing, Carolina Falkholt practice involve collage, sculpture, installation, performance, film and photo. She often build up her drawings with endless amounts of circles creating a web, sometimes over vibrant colors. Typical motifs she has been investigating in her art is connected to the body, like eyes, ears, mouth, hands and the vagina. In many of her paintings of hands it is actually letters, since she is using Swedish Sign Language in her art. She is also a musician and has released records as part of her artistic practice. In several projects she has initiated various forms of collaboration with other artists, musicians, the public and organizations.

In 2010, Falkholt realized the big project Graffiti Mariestad that circulated around a now demolished silo in Mariestad harbor. During a number of months before the building was to be dismantled, the façade was painted while activities in and around the silo were ongoing. The project involved about 30 graffiti writers, including Nug, Rubin and Dwane, musicians, dancers, artists and hundreds of young people. The project resulted in one of the world's largest graffiti paintings. The project Graffiti Mariestad also resulted in Falkholt being commissioned to create a public sculpture in Mariestad, which was built, among other things, from material from the demolished silo. The twelve-meter high sculpture  T.E.S.T. was inaugurated in June 2011. The whole process is documented in the book SILO.

Carolina Falkholt has had solo exhibitions at Gothenburg Museum of Art, Eskilstuna Museum of Art, Ystad Art Museum, Steneby Konsthall in Dalsland and Klippans konsthall in Skåne., among others. In 2013, she was one of the participants in Swedish Televisions (SVT) program Konstkuppen and that same year she curated and participated as an artist in the exhibition Mynningsladdare (Muzzleloader) at Röda Sten Konsthall in Gothenburg. In the same year, she participated in the X-Border biennial with the project Firewall with paintings in the three towns Severomorsk, Rovaniemi and Luleå and made the 16 meter long piece Wet Paint at Kulturhuset in Stockholm. Falkholt is represented by, among others, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Skövde Museum of Art and Halland Museum of Cultural History. In 2014 she made the painting Övermålning (Overpainting) as a commission for a highschool in Nyköping. She started by writing derogatory words towards women on the wall and then painted them over with a stylized motif of the lower part of a womans naked body. The artwork created a heated argument which was covered in media, both in Sweden and internationally. At one point politicians took the decision to build a wall in front of the painting. But Falholt and the painting had many strong supporters. The principal of the school said: "I see many pedagogic advantages to having her art in the school". After much debate the wall in front of the painting was taken down. In connection with this debate she made a performance at Konstakademien in Stockholm, where she invited politicians to Skenbröllop, a sham marriage with her. Two politicians said yes, Marita Ulvskog (Swedish Social Democratic Party) and Sissela Nordling Blanco (Feminist Initiative).

In 2015 she made a huge mural as a commission for the highschool Parkskolan in Ystad. The painting Untitled (Firewall), depict yet another stylized naked woman haning upside down with her legs in an unnatural contorted position. 2017 she was invited as one on the artist for the exhibition SculptureMotion at Wanås sculpture park, together with William Forsythe, Henrik Plenge Jakobsen, Sonia Khurana and Éva Mag. For this exhibition she did the work Train of thoughts, a railroad car moved to the woods, first painted white and then filled with her black circles creating an organic web over the whole surface.

In December 2017 she painted a 40 foot erect human penis on a building at 303 Broome Street, New York, NY. She signed the artwork on the lower right hand side. The mural was painted over by the buildings owner three days later.

Fuck the World
Fuck the World is a mural by Falkholt which depicts an erect blue penis and covers five storeys of an apartment block () in Stockholm, Sweden.

The work was unveiled in April 2018 on Kronobergsvägen in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm. Falkholt whose work explores human sexuality said of it, "They should consider what it is they are so upset about and then talk about it"  and "Sex is so important, but it’s always been too dirty to discuss."

Falkholt was confident that Stockholm residents would be receptive to the work and that it would avoid the fate of an earlier work of a pink and orange penis which was painted on the side of a four-storey building in lower Manhattan in December 2017, but was painted over after a few weeks. However following complaints from neighbouring residents, it was announced a week after being unveiled that the work is to be painted over.

Industry

Industry is the most important area of Ukraine's economy. In the current structure of Ukraine's industry a great proportion is occupied by heavy industry, especially the steel, machine-building and coal industries. A considerable part is played by the food and light industries. Top position is held by machine building.

The black coal industry is concentrated in two basins: Donets and Lviv-Vol-hynia. The largest centre of the brown coal industry is Kirovograd region. The oil and gas industries are located in the Subcarpathian and Left-Bank regions, but the extraction of oil and natural gas is insufficient to satisfy the country's needs.

Ukraine has a strong power generation industry. Large thermal and hydroelectric stations have been built. There are 10 nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Apart from the infamous plant in Chor-nobyl, others are to be found in Rivne, Zaporizhia, Khmelnytsky, the Crimea and Mykolayiv regions.

The metallurgical industry includes the ferrous and non-ferrous industries. Metallurgical plants are spread through three regions — the Donbas, Dnieper and Azov Coast regions.

The machine-building industry is presently the largest branch of industry. Instrument-making is one of the most scattered branch. A plant in Sumy produces such diverse instruments as electron microscopes and cine-cameras. An important place is occupied by heavy machine building, which provides plant and equipment for metallurgy, power stations and cement plants. A large plant is located in Kramatorsk and is a leading supplier of metallurgical equipment and powerful excavators. Smaller enterprises have been built in other centers of the Donbas and Dnieper area. Here large plants turn out powerful turbines, generators and steam boilers.

Shipbuilding is now an important branch of industry. Seagoing vessels are built at shipyards located in Mykolayiv, Kherson and Kyiv.
The motor vehicle industry sprung up after WW II, Buses are produced in Lviv, passenger cars in Zaporizhia, lorries in Kremenchuk, and both passenger and transport vehicles in Lutsk. Kharkiv has a specialized vehicle engine works. Aeroplanes are built in Kyiv and Kharkiv.

Farm machinery plants turn out nearly all types of soil cultivating, sowing and harvesting machines. The manufacture of tractors and combine harvesters is concentrated in large plants such as Kharkiv Tractor Works.

The chemical industry embraces the production of acids, alkalis, salts, fertilizers, dyes, detergents, plastics, synthetic fibres, pharmaceuticals and other goods.

The manufacture of building materials is well-developed in all of Ukraine's regions. Ukrainian limestone, sandstone, marble, granite, gabbro and labradorite already face thousands of buildings through the country. Cement works are located mainly in the Donets-Dnieper and Southwestern Economic Areas.

Ukraine's food industry is located mostly in the Forest-Steppe (sugar), the Steppe (vegetable oils), the South (fruit canning, wine). There are many textile enterprises in Ukraine: cotton (Kherson, Ternopil), linen (Rivne, Zhytomyr), wool (Chernihiv, Luhansk), silk (Kyiv, Cherkasy). Garment and footwear industries are located in large population centres. China and pottery enterprises have developed in Kharkiv, Sloviansk, in the area of Novohrad-Volynsky.</span></div></div>

As Buzzfeed reports, the letter was sent Sunday night and stating the couple "believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy -- particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what’s right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account." After an opening up with a reverent declaration, it quickly shifts gears. Particularly when it condemns "an influential slice of the media" that "has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print -- even when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason."

The letter goes on to explain that they've "watched people they know -- as well as complete strangers -- have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue." At that point, the couple indicates that they will "not be engaging" with those four outlets. They went on to clarify that this was not a "blanket policy for all media," but they would no longer "offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion."

On Monday, Markle also gave an interview with Good Morning America, although it was actually taped before the couple made their decision public. Much of the interview was spent discussing the Disney+ feature Elephants, which she narrates.

"I've been very lucky to be able to have hands-on experience with elephants in their natural habitat," Markle explained. When you spend time connecting with them and the other wildlife, you really understand we have a role to play in their preservation and safety."

Since the couple has decided to settle in Los Angeles, California, at least for now, they were spotted delivering meals to residents who've had their lives turned upside-down by coronavirus. It's part of their work with the non-profit Project Angel Food, which delivers meals to patients with illnesses that hinders their ability to go out in public.</span></div></div>

How to access ItemsHost from a ItemsControl derived custom control

I'm creating a custom control called FooControl derived from ItemsControl have a default style defined for the same in themes\generic.xaml.
The default style for FooControl sets ItemsPanel property to another custom panel called FooPanel as below (I don't think the usage of custom panel matters for this question).
&lt;Setter Property="ItemsPanel">
  &lt;Setter.Value>
    &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate>
      &lt;local:FooPanel IsItemsHost="True"/>
    &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate>
  &lt;/Setter.Value>
&lt;/Setter>

In the code behind of my FooControl, I want to get access to the instance of FooPanel that was created automatically. By looking in reflector I found that ItemsControl does have a property called ItemsHost but I cannot access it from FooControl as ItemsHost is internal
Can someone plz suggest me a reliable way to get reference to the instance of FooPanel?

A:

Unfortunately the ItemsControl control does not expose a reference to this element (in fact, I have a feeling that the ItemsControl doesn't even have access to it itself).
Using VisualTreeHelper.GetChild() as suggested in the previous post may work, but it will break if the items control is restyled in such a way that causes the items panel do be nested further down.
A slightly less fragile (but still far from perfect) way to get a reference is to get the parent of the container for the first child (assuming that your items control contains at least one item)
Panel itemsPanel;

if (Items.Count == 0)
{
   itemsPanel = null;
}
else
{
   var firstContainer = ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(0);

   itemsPanel = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(firstContainer) as Panel;
}

Note: This only works in SL3 and above since it uses the ItemContainerGenerator property (I believe a work around may exist for SL2)

K-Mean with Numpy

I have implemented the K-Mean clustering Algorithm in Numpy:
from __future__ import division
import numpy as np

def kmean_step(centroids, datapoints):
    ds = centroids[:,np.newaxis]-datapoints
    e_dists =  np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(ds),axis=-1))
    cluster_allocs = np.argmin(e_dists, axis=0)
    clusters = [datapoints[cluster_allocs==ci] for ci in range(len(centroids))]
    new_centroids = np.asarray([(1/len(cl))*np.sum(cl, axis=0) for cl in clusters if len(cl)>0])
    return new_centroids, clusters

def kmean(centroids, datapoints, n_gen, do_print=True):
    clusters=None
    for ii in range(1,n_gen):
        new_centroids, clusters = kmean_step(centroids, datapoints)
        if np.array_equal(centroids,new_centroids):
            print "After %i generations stabalised" % ii
            break
        else:
            centroids = new_centroids
            if do_print:
                print_clusters(clusters,centroids)
    return clusters

I have left out the print_clusters method. It as expected, displays the current clusters using coloured plots in matplotlib.
Issues

kmean_step seems really ugly for an algorithm that can be described by:

Recluster the dataset around the centroids;
Recenter the centroids with their clusters.

I am a bit unsure about the termination conditions in the kmean function. I have read that they are:

Centroids don't move,
or Cluster membership does not change,
or number of iterations exceeds preset max.

I have the first and last of those, but the second seems like it will happen automatically by the first. If the cluster membership doesn't change, then the center doesn't move. Do I really need to include it? (it is surprisingly hard to implement) Or is it only included in the algorithm description for clarity?
Is this an optimal way to implement it? To fully take advantage of vectorized operations? I am a bit iff about having 2 list comprehensions, particularly since one immediately cases to a ndarrray.

A:

1. Code review

There's no documentation. What do your functions do and how am I supposed to call them?
There are no test cases. What gives you confidence that the algorithm is correct?
The algorithm is called "\$k\$-means" (not "\$k\$-mean") so I would name the functions accordingly.
The do_print mechanism looks as if it was added to help with debugging and then you forgot to remove it. Surely no user of this code is going to be interested in this? It would be better to use Python's built-in debugging facilities so that you don't need to add this kind of debugging code.
Similarly for the "After %i generations stabilised" message.
The steps in the \$k\$-means algorithm are not normally known as generations so you might want to choose a clearer name, for example steps or iterations.
The iterator range is exclusive at the top end. So range(1, n_gen) iterates from 1 up to ngen - 1 inclusive, which is probably not what you meant.
If n_gens is less than 2, kmean returns None instead of a list of clusters. It would be better to raise an exception in this case, so that the caller doesn't have to handle the exceptional return value. Alternatively, you could ensure that at least one step is taken. (Which is what I've done in my revised code below.)
Your chosen format for the return value of kmean (a list of clusters, each cluster being an array of datapoints) is likely to be inconvenient for further processing by NumPy. Generally in NumPy we want everything to be returned as uniform arrays. So if you do want to return the clusters (rather than the centroids), it would be better to return them in the form of an array giving the cluster number for each datapoint (that is, in the format of your cluster_allocs array).
Your implementation omits the initialization step (that is, the selection of initial candidate values for the centroids). It would make sense to include at least one initialization method (for example, Forgy) so that the burden is not imposed on the caller.
The kmean_step operations are hard to follow because the variables are not clearly named (what is ds? what is the e in e_dists) and because you have expressed all your loops in the form of list comprehensions. When a comprehension becomes so long and unwieldy that you feel the need to use obscure variable names like ci and cl, it's probably time to rewrite it as a loop.
The function kmean_step is not likely to be useful to the caller, so there's no good reason to put this part of the code in its own function. The component of the algorithm that's likely to be generally useful is the computation of the centroids of the clusters.
Pairwise distances can be computed using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.
You don't need to take square roots: squared distances are sufficient to determine the closest centroid to each data point. So if you are using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist then you'd use the sqeuclidean metric.

2. Revised code
Note the docstrings, the example code (which you can run as test cases using the doctest module), and the simple and straightforward implementation. (It is a shame that there has to be a loop in cluster_centroids, but I don't know how to avoid it.)

(ANTIMEDIA) Arrowhead Springs, CA — “If Nestle wasn’t so powerful, I Strongly believe the Forest Service would [err] in the side of stream protection. We (everyone, both scientists and others) know enough to say removing water right now can’t help but make the drought emergency worse for those streams that are already stressed to the max.

“And yet, in all of this, water continues to run in their pipes, robbing it from this very critical watershed. And not just any environment. Very sad.” — Retired Forest Service biologist with over 40 years on the job, in a statement via email.

An ongoing investigation by the Anti-Media — sparked by Ian James’ series in the Desert Sun — into Nestle’s sourcing its bottled water from Arrowhead Springs, (located in San Bernardino National Forest) using a permit that expired over a quarter century ago, just made a rather stunning discovery.

“And, by the way, these aren’t springs as you and I envision a spring bubbling up out of the ground — they have horizontal wells that go into the mountainside, sometimes as far as 500 feet. And those horizontal pipes, of course, create a void; and water always seeks the path of least resistance, so the water seeps into their horizontal pipes and then drains out of the side of the mountain,” explained Gary Earney — who retired after decades with the U.S. Forest Service, where he was in charge of granting special-use permits — in a phone call with the Anti-Media.

California water is an unnecessarily complex topic that was further complicated when the continuing drought forced the governor to institute a system of restrictions and fines. Intended to ensure no individual or business would waste the precious resource, the restrictions and fines actually stratified and delineated the wealth gap — those who can afford to do so simply pay whatever fine is necessary to lessen the impact restrictions would create on daily life.

You know . . . what drought?

Previous articles in the series:

Avoid Saying “It’s Just Water” on Your Trip to California

Of critical importance to circumstances surrounding Nestle’s ostensible draw and collection of spring water — brought to retail bearing the label: Arrowhead 100% Mountain Spring Water — is the fact that the bottles bear the company’s claim its water is sourced from a natural “spring.”

To wit, compare the legal definitions for bottled “spring” and “well” water, under the Code of Federal Regulations: Title 21 § 165.110 (a)(2)(vi)(viii):

(vi) The name of water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth may be “spring water.” Spring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice. The location of the spring shall be identified. Spring water collected with the use of an external force shall be from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. If spring water is collected with the use of an external force, water must continue to flow naturally to the surface of the earth through the spring’s natural orifice . Plants shall demonstrate, on request, to appropriate regulatory officials, using a hydrogeologically valid method, that an appropriate hydraulic connection exists between the natural orifice of the spring and the bore hole.

(viii) The name of water from a hole bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground which taps the water of an aquifer may be “well water.”

See where this is heading?

No, It Isn’t Sping Water, and the Inspector General Has Known That for Years

By these definitions, and in the context of Earney’s description, an emphatically pertinent question is raised: Is the water Nestle draws from what is ostensibly the site of Arrowhead Springs, really what the company claims it is on the bottle — is it actually “spring” water, at all?

Conversation with Earney continued:

Question: “By any stretch of the imagination, can what they’re [Nestle] doing be described as pulling spring water, in your estimation?” Earney: “Actually, in my estimate, no — and the Office of the Inspector General, which did an inspection of that use a few years back, determined that Nestle was not taking spring water, they were taking groundwater.” During the call, he also verified water at the site of the springs is not, in fact, coming naturally to the surface — nor could it, given Nestle’s extensive piping infrastructure.

It’s important to note, as Earney emphasized, that the Forest Service has nothing to do with the laws and regulations governing water rights in the state. Because the supposed spring is located on property the Forest Service is tasked with maintaining, the agency deals purely with the infrastructure Nestle uses, and its maintenance and impact on the property.

About Those Water Rights

Nestle has claimed for years its rights to Arrowhead Springs date back to the turn of the last century — however, not-so-strangely, deed transfers marking Arrowhead Springs’ supposed migration through a string of dissolving and forming Nestle companies have been notoriously difficult to track down. A subject of contention for many, Nestle’s loud claims to historic rights are beginning to sound hollow when requests to view relevant documentation are simply shrugged off.

Could a deed from 1929 offer insight into Nestle’s reluctance to be transparent and forthcoming?

Clearly delineated in the text of this deed are rights to subterranean water at the site — but the only property denoting springs is Indian Springs.

Incidentally, as reported in The Pontiac Tribune, both the first and second articles in this series about the Nestle scandal were upvoted to occupy positions near the top of Reddit‘s front page. However — just as the second article seemed to reach its peak popularity — Reddit seemingly extended a corporate arm when the board’s moderators censored the article by removing it from the page entirely. Eventually, the reason for its banishment was said to be due to an assessment the article amounted to an opinion piece. Coincidentally, the article gained a spot at the top of the prized Reddit front page before anyone found this to be a problem.

In the Nestle vs. California drought debate, what is your opinion on water rights?

This is the third in our series of investigations into Nestle’s role in extracting massive amounts of groundwater in California during the record drought.

SQLite &amp; Its Drivers

I'm new to the SQLite database, and more generally, to the concept of embedded databases altogether. I'm used to creating a connection string and connecting to a remote DB server (MySQL, MSSQL Srv, Oracle, etc.). I know this question is probably quite silly, but being in uncharted waters here, I can't seem to find the answer to this on my own.
So I'm writing a Java app that uses SQLiteJDBC as the Java driver for SQLite (the app's embedded db) and am creating the tables and inserting records into them from the Java app itself. What I'd like to do is download/install SQLite on my system - completely independent of the Java app - and then write SQL scripts that will do the "skeletonizing" (creating &amp; insertions) of the database file itself, then copy that .sqlite file into my project directory where the app can then use it.
I'm just finding it incredibly difficult to develop database schema from inside the Java app itself; just seems like an unnecessary step.
So, my question:
Is this even possible? To create, say, myProgramDB.sqlite off the command line with the SQLite tool, and then (essentially) cut-n'-paste that file into my Eclipse/NetBeans project (of course, in the right directory!) and have it work? This is also assuming I have correctly imported the SQLiteJDBC JAR into my project through the IDE.  I just want to create the DB somewhere else, then copy it into my project, instead of developing the DB through my app directly.
Thanks for any insight!

A:

Just think of the database as a normal file which your app refers to either by an absolute or relative file path, so with that in mind embed it in your project like you would any other file in Eclipse (or point to a specific location where you expect it to be).
If you're going to create your db manually, SQLiteStudio (http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/) is free tool which will help you build the schema.
It also lets you export the structure and/or data as sql statements, which you can then use to build a copy of your database elsewhere.
