To make the documentation more readable I want to at least add code in every .c/.h file pair to one group using @defgroup and @ingroup. Inside these groups I want to group some defines together using @name blocks.\n\n\nThe result in the \&quot;file\&quot; pages looks closely to what I expected: Everything that's documented in the file is listed there and more or less nicely grouped.\nIn the \&quot;module\&quot; pages on the other hand only functions and variables are listed and the defines before the first @name block are listed under \&quot;variables\&quot;. All other defines and enums are missing.\nRemoving the @name blocks lists all defines/typedefs/enums under \&quot;variables\&quot;. No own sections for macros or enums and no further grouping on these pages.\n\n\nHow do I get all defines and enums in a group listed on the module/group page like on the file pages where the defines/functions etc. are documented?\n\n\nI use doxygen 1.8.9.1 windows binarires. \n\n\nMy code looks similar to this:\n.h file:\n\n\n\n```\n/** @file\n*   blabla\n*   @author bla\n*/\n/// @ingroup MY_GRP\n/// @{\n#define SOMEDEF1 1\n/// @name Special defs\n/// @{\n#define SOMEDEF2 2\n/// @}\nenum someenum {\nfoo,\nbar\n};\n\nextern int some_variables;\n\nextern void some_proc(int baz);\n\n/// @}\n\n```\n\n.c file looks like this:\n\n\n\n```\n/** @file\n *  blabla\n *  @author bla\n */\n/** @defgroup MY_GRP A test group.\n  * Description\n  */\n/// @{\n#include \&quot;my.h\&quot;\n\n/// Important variable.\nint some_variable;\n\n/** Important proc\n *  Description\n *  @param baz need this\n */\nvoid some_proc(int baz) {\n// code\n}\n\n/// @}\n\n```\n\nI let doxygen wizzard generate a doxyfile and also generated a DoxygenLayout.xml file.\nWhen playing arround with the layout file I found that the \&quot;defines\&quot; tags on the group pages are empty (they apparently do nothing) while the \&quot;defines\&quot; in the variables section are generated by a \&quot;membergroups\&quot; tag...

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Put all your defines, enums, and other related items in a separate file, let's call it `mydefs.h`.\n2. Create a new group for these items using the @defgroup command, like this:\n\n ```\n /\\*\\*\n \\* @defgroup MyDefs My Defines\n \\* @{\n \\* Defines and enums used throughout the project.\n \\*/\n\n /\\*\\*\n \\* @name Special defs\n \\* @{\n \\*/\n #define SOMEDEF2 2\n /\\*\\* @} \\*/\n\n enum someenum {\n foo,\n bar\n };\n /\\*\\* @} \\*/\n ```\n\n3. In each .c file that uses these defines/enums, include the `mydefs.h` file and add the @ingroup and @addtogroup commands, like this:\n\n ```\n /\\*\\*\n \\* @file my.c\n \\* @brief Description\n \\* @ingroup MY\\_GRP\n \\* @{\n \\*/\n\n #include \&quot;mydefs.h\&quot;\n\n extern int some\\_variables;\n\n extern void some\\_proc(int baz);\n\n /\\*\\* @} \\*/\n ```\n\n4. Finally, in your Doxygen configuration file, make sure that the EXTRACT\\_ALL setting is set to YES, and the EXTRACT\\_PRIVATE and EXTRACT\\_STATIC settings are set to NO. This will ensure that all items in the `mydefs.h` file are included in the documentation.\n\nWith these steps, all your defines and enums should be properly grouped and listed on the module/group page, along with your other functions and variables.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Recommend a book for me to read and explain the reason.&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I recommend \&quot;The Alchemist\&quot; by Paulo Coelho.

The two countries have longstanding ties, particularly in the energy sector, and have cooperated on various projects in recent years. Azerbaijan has also been a mediator in Iran's relations with other countries, including Russia and the United States.\n\nThe visit comes amid a changing political landscape in Iraq, with Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi facing mounting pressure from various factions within the country. Some have called for early elections, while others are pushing for major reforms to the political system.\n\nIran, which has been a key player in Iraq for years, has been closely monitoring developments there. Tehran has supported various Iraqi factions, including Shia militias, and has been involved in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nZarif's visit is also seen as part of Iran's broader outreach to its neighbors amid tensions with the United States. Iran has been hit hard by U.S. sanctions in recent years, and has responded by stepping up its cooperation with Russia and China, as well as strengthening ties with regional powers such as Turkey and Qatar.\n\nOverall, Zarif's visit to Azerbaijan underscores the complex web of relationships that exist in the Middle East, and highlights the challenges of resolving conflicts and promoting stability in a region where external powers often have competing interests.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Answer the following question.\nIn what year did Jimi Hendrix first take Hey Joe into the top ten&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1967&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Question: What is the main ingredient in a margarita cocktail?&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ingredient: Tequila.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Does the following sentence contain a run-on?: \&quot;I walked to the park and I ordered a hotdog.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Write the answer: What region did China annex?&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There is no clear context or timeframe provided to answer this question accurately.

You can modify the code to suit your needs, such as changing the input file name, output directory, or pdflatex options.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:55,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Say I have for example \n\n\n\n```\n(define sample '(\&quot;a\&quot; \&quot;b\&quot; \&quot;c\&quot;))\n\n```\n\nHow would I go about creating a nested loop that will work with sample.\n\n\n\n```\n (define (runthis a)\n    (cond\n    (char?

Your current code is a mix of a recursive function and a nested loop. Here's an example of how you can create a nested loop that works with `sample`:\n\n\n```\n(define sample '(\&quot;a\&quot; \&quot;b\&quot; \&quot;c\&quot;))\n\n(define (run-this lst)\n  (define (inner-loop inner-lst)\n    (if (null? inner-lst)\n        'done\n        (begin\n          (display (car inner-lst))\n          (inner-loop (cdr inner-lst)))))\n  \n  (if (null? lst)\n      'done\n      (begin\n        (display (car lst))\n        (inner-loop (cdr lst))\n        (run-this (cdr lst)))))\n```\n\n\nHere, we define a function `run-this` that takes a list as input. Within it, we define another function `inner-loop` that takes a list as input. \n\nThe `run-this` function uses a basic loop template: we first check if the list is empty, in which case we terminate the loop and return `done`. Otherwise, we perform some action (in this case, displaying the current element of `lst`), and then move on to the next element of the list by recursively calling `run-this` on the remainder of the list (`cdr lst`).\n\nThe `inner-loop` function is called for each element of `lst`, and performs a similar loop: it checks if the list is empty, and terminates if so. Otherwise, it performs some action (in this case, displaying the current element of `inner-lst`), and then moves on to the next element of the list in the same way.\n\nTogether, these two nested loops allow us to traverse each element of `sample` and each element of each element of `sample`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can call this function:\n\n\n```\n(run-this sample)\n;; Output:\n;; a\n;; b\n;; c\n```\n\n\nNote that this function assumes that every element of `lst` is either a string or a list of strings - if this is not the case, you may need to modify the function to handle other types of elements.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:56,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;How do you do this: rubber\n\nOPTIONS:\n- can be squeezed by tweezers \n- can be cleaned by tweezers&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I am sorry but the instruction \&quot;How do you do this: rubber\&quot; is not clear.

I have read the `Task Queue` is the solution, however how do we convert this simple code into App engine-friendly code? \n\n\nHow is the code above implemented using Task queue? For example to call `getNewNotifications()` for every five seconds.\n\n\nAnd that function will get some results from the server, parse the result and then execute the activities/work it needs to do based on the result. \n\n&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To migrate existing multithreaded code to App Engine, you can use the Task Queue API. The Task Queue API provides a way to execute code asynchronously on App Engine. Rather than running code in a separate thread, you create a task and put it on the task queue. The task is then picked up and executed asynchronously by the App Engine infrastructure.\n\nHere's how you can convert your code to use the Task Queue API:\n\n1. Define a new servlet or handler that will handle the task. For example:\n\n```java\npublic class MyTaskHandler extends HttpServlet {\n public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)\n throws ServletException, IOException {\n // Do work here\n }\n}\n```\n\n2. Replace the `t.start()` call with a call to the Task Queue API. For example:\n\n```java\nQueue queue = QueueFactory.getQueue(\&quot;my-queue\&quot;);\nqueue.add(TaskOptions.Builder.withUrl(\&quot;/tasks/mytask\&quot;));\n```\n\nThis will enqueue a task to be executed by the `MyTaskHandler` servlet.\n\n3. Rewrite the `getNewNotifications()` method to be fully self-contained and to not rely on the `alive` flag. Instead, the method should return immediately and the results should be processed by the task handler. For example:\n\n```java\npublic void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)\n throws ServletException, IOException {\n List notifications = getNewNotificationsFromServer();\n processNotifications(notifications);\n}\n```\n\nNote that in this example, the `getNewNotificationsFromServer()` method is now blocking and will wait for the server to return. If the server returns slowly or not at all, the task may take a long time to complete.\n\n4. To schedule the task to run every five seconds, use a cron job to enqueue a new task at the desired interval. For example:\n\n```xml\n\n/tasks/mytask\nDo something every 5 seconds\nevery 5s\n\n```\n\nThis will enqueue a new task every five seconds that will be picked up and executed by the `MyTaskHandler` servlet.\n\nNote that the Task Queue API has some limitations compared to multithreading, such as increased latency and lack of control over the execution environment. However, it is a powerful tool for building scalable and reliable applications on App Engine.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;First question: Who are some lesser known important historical figures of Myanmar and what should people know about them?\nSecond question: Who are some lesser known important historical figures of Portugal and what should people know about them?\nAre these two questions asking the same thing?\nOPTIONS:\n- no\n- yes&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, these two questions are asking about different historical figures from different countries.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Elliot See, almaMater, University of Texas at Austin; Elliot See, deathPlace, St. Louis; Elliot See, birthPlace, Dallas; Elliot See, deathDate, \&quot;1966-02-28\&quot;; Elliot See, occupation, Test pilot; Elliot See, nationality, United States&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Elliot See, a US test pilot, born in Dallas, TX, and an alum of the University of Texas at Austin, died in St. Louis on 1966-02-28.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sentence 1: He has received awards from the Ghalib Academy , Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy in New Delhi .\nSentence 2: He has received awards from Ghalib Academy , Lucknow and Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy in New Delhi .\n\nDo these two sentences convey the same information?\n\nOPTIONS:\n- no\n- yes&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes.

You can accomplish this by first loading the PDF form, then utilizing the AcroFields class to get access to the individual form fields. From there, you can add or remove fields using the appropriate API methods. Once you have made your changes, you can save the modified PDF form using the PDFStamper.\n\nHere is an example using iTextSharp:\n\n\n```\n// Load PDF form\nPdfReader reader = new PdfReader(\&quot;originalForm.pdf\&quot;);\nPdfStamper stamper = new PdfStamper(reader, new FileStream(\&quot;modifiedForm.pdf\&quot;, FileMode.Create));\n\n// Get access to form fields\nAcroFields form = stamper.AcroFields;\n\n// Dynamically create form fields based on user input\nfor (int i = 0; i < transactions.length; i++) \n{\n    // Insert transaction title text\n    form.SetField(\&quot;title\&quot; + i, \&quot;Transaction \&quot; + i);\n\n    // Insert transaction field\n    form.AddSingleLineTextField(\&quot;transaction\&quot; + i, \&quot;\&quot;);\n\n    // Insert transaction amount field\n    form.AddSingleLineTextField(\&quot;amount\&quot; + i, \&quot;\&quot;);\n}\n\n// Remove form fields based on user input\nif (transactions.length == 0) \n{\n    form.RemoveField(\&quot;title0\&quot;);\n    form.RemoveField(\&quot;transaction0\&quot;);\n    form.RemoveField(\&quot;amount0\&quot;);\n}\n\n// Close PDF stamper\nstamper.Close();\nreader.Close();\n\n```\n\n\nWith Adobe Acrobat DC, you can use the Actions Wizard to set up custom JavaScript that responds to user input. In Acrobat, you can go to Tools > Action Wizard > Create New Action > Custom Sequence. From there, you can add JavaScript actions to add, remove, or modify form fields based on user input.\n\nHere is an example JavaScript for Acrobat:\n\n\n```\n// Get access to form fields\nvar form = this.getField(\&quot;form\&quot;);\n\n// Dynamically create form fields based on user input\nfor (var i = 0; i < transactions.length; i++) \n{\n    // Insert transaction title text\n    form.addField(\&quot;title\&quot; + i, \&quot;text\&quot;, i, [10, 10, 50, 20]);\n\n    // Insert transaction field\n    form.addField(\&quot;transaction\&quot; + i, \&quot;text\&quot;, i + 1, [60, 10, 100, 20]);\n\n    // Insert transaction amount field\n    form.addField(\&quot;amount\&quot; + i, \&quot;text\&quot;, i + 2, [110, 10, 150, 20]);\n}\n\n// Remove form fields based on user input\nif (transactions.length == 0) \n{\n    form.removeField(\&quot;title0\&quot;);\n    form.removeField(\&quot;transaction0\&quot;);\n    form.removeField(\&quot;amount0\&quot;);\n}\n\n```\n\n\nOverall, both iTextSharp and Adobe Acrobat DC provide options for dynamically creating or removing form fields based on user input. It'll depend on your specific needs and preferences as to which solution you'll want to use.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:80,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;(OPRAH.com\nSummarize the highlights of this article.&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm sorry, I cannot summarize the highlights of an article without a specific article to refer to.

Here's an example that should work for you:\n\n\n```\nDECLARE\n   tbname   VARCHAR2 (200);\n   v_sql    VARCHAR2 (4000);\n   refcur   SYS_REFCURSOR;\nBEGIN\n   SELECT '\&quot;data_' || REPLACE (TO_CHAR (SYSDATE - 1, 'yyyy.mm.dd'), '.', '') || '\&quot;@myDB'\n   INTO   tbname\n   FROM   DUAL;\n   \n   v_sql := 'SELECT * FROM ' || tbname;\n   OPEN refcur FOR v_sql;\n   -- use refcur to fetch data or do whatever you need to do with the result set\nEND;\n\n```\n\n\nIn this example, we first declare the variable tbname and use a SELECT statement to set its value to the table name we want to use. Next, we define a SQL statement as a string variable v\\_sql, using the table name variable in the statement. Finally, we open a cursor using the dynamic SQL statement and can use the cursor to fetch data or do whatever we need to do with the result set.\n\nNote that using dynamic SQL in this way can be a security risk if the table name variable is not properly validated. It's recommended to validate the variable or use bind variables in your SQL statements to avoid SQL injection attacks.&quot;},&quot;input&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;instruction&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What are some additional elements that you would like to include in the customer agreement document? \nAlso, included below is a sample code in Markdown that can generate a new text file:\n```\n[Sample Text](data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,Sample text)\n```\nHow can this code be modified to include the customer agreement text file and any additional elements that you would like to include?&quot;},&quot;output&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;As an AI assistant, I would suggest including the following elements in the customer agreement document:\n1.

To make the documentation more readable I want to at least add code in every .c/.h file pair to one group using @defgroup and @ingroup. Inside these groups I want to group some defines together using @name blocks.


The result in the "file" pages looks closely to what I expected: Everything that's documented in the file is listed there and more or less nicely grouped.
In the "module" pages on the other hand only functions and variables are listed and the defines before the first @name block are listed under "variables". All other defines and enums are missing.
Removing the @name blocks lists all defines/typedefs/enums under "variables". No own sections for macros or enums and no further grouping on these pages.


How do I get all defines and enums in a group listed on the module/group page like on the file pages where the defines/functions etc. are documented?


I use doxygen 1.8.9.1 windows binarires. 


My code looks similar to this:
.h file:



```
/** @file
*   blabla
*   @author bla
*/
/// @ingroup MY_GRP
/// @{
#define SOMEDEF1 1
/// @name Special defs
/// @{
#define SOMEDEF2 2
/// @}
enum someenum {
foo,
bar
};

extern int some_variables;

extern void some_proc(int baz);

/// @}

```

.c file looks like this:



```
/** @file
 *  blabla
 *  @author bla
 */
/** @defgroup MY_GRP A test group.
  * Description
  */
/// @{
#include "my.h"

/// Important variable.

I let doxygen wizzard generate a doxyfile and also generated a DoxygenLayout.xml file.
When playing arround with the layout file I found that the "defines" tags on the group pages are empty (they apparently do nothing) while the "defines" in the variables section are generated by a "membergroups" tag... Don't know what to make of this.


Any help is much appreciated. If you need the doxyfile or anything else let me know.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To get all defines and enums in a group listed on the module/group page, you need to use the @defgroup and @addtogroup commands properly. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Put all your defines, enums, and other related items in a separate file, let's call it `mydefs.h`.
2. Create a new group for these items using the @defgroup command, like this:

 ```
 /\*\*
 \* @defgroup MyDefs My Defines
 \* @{
 \* Defines and enums used throughout the project.
 \*/

 /\*\*
 \* @name Special defs
 \* @{
 \*/
 #define SOMEDEF2 2
 /\*\* @} \*/

 enum someenum {
 foo,
 bar
 };
 /\*\* @} \*/
 ```

3. In each .c file that uses these defines/enums, include the `mydefs.h` file and add the @ingroup and @addtogroup commands, like this:

 ```
 /\*\*
 \* @file my.c
 \* @brief Description
 \* @ingroup MY\_GRP
 \* @{
 \*/

 #include "mydefs.h"

 extern int some\_variables;

 extern void some\_proc(int baz);

 /\*\* @} \*/
 ```

4. Finally, in your Doxygen configuration file, make sure that the EXTRACT\_ALL setting is set to YES, and the EXTRACT\_PRIVATE and EXTRACT\_STATIC settings are set to NO. This will ensure that all items in the `mydefs.h` file are included in the documentation.

With these steps, all your defines and enums should be properly grouped and listed on the module/group page, along with your other functions and variables.</span></div></div>

The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, arrived in Azerbaijan yesterday for talks on various regional issues, including the future of Iraq. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival, Zarif expressed Iran's desire for a government in Iraq that is representative of the people.

"The people of Iraq have suffered for too long because of sectarian divisions and foreign interference," Zarif said. "Iran's position is clear: we want a government in Iraq that is truly representative of the will of the people, one that can bring prosperity and stability to the country."

Zarif also met with Azerbaijani officials to discuss bilateral relations and regional security. The two countries have longstanding ties, particularly in the energy sector, and have cooperated on various projects in recent years. Azerbaijan has also been a mediator in Iran's relations with other countries, including Russia and the United States.

The visit comes amid a changing political landscape in Iraq, with Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi facing mounting pressure from various factions within the country. Some have called for early elections, while others are pushing for major reforms to the political system.

Iran, which has been a key player in Iraq for years, has been closely monitoring developments there. Tehran has supported various Iraqi factions, including Shia militias, and has been involved in the fight against the Islamic State group.

Zarif's visit is also seen as part of Iran's broader outreach to its neighbors amid tensions with the United States. Iran has been hit hard by U.S. sanctions in recent years, and has responded by stepping up its cooperation with Russia and China, as well as strengthening ties with regional powers such as Turkey and Qatar.

Overall, Zarif's visit to Azerbaijan underscores the complex web of relationships that exist in the Middle East, and highlights the challenges of resolving conflicts and promoting stability in a region where external powers often have competing interests.</span></div></div>

SELECT table1.A, table1.B, table2.C

JOIN (SELECT B, C FROM table2) table2

This query creates two subqueries, one for each of the original SELECT statements. These subqueries are then used to create two temporary tables named "table1" and "table2", each with two columns (A,B and B,C respectively).

The two tables are then joined on the common column "B" using the JOIN keyword. The resulting table has three columns (A,B,C) and includes only the rows where the values of Column B match between the two original queries.

Note that you will need to replace "table1" and "table2" with the actual names of your tables or subqueries.</span></div></div>

When colleges and universities close, the students get to have a day off. Normally, this might be a happy moment for many. But around the United States, the scale and frequency of school closings this winter is making everyone a little twitchy. A region stretching from Texas to Maine has been directly impacted by more than 150 school closures due to major winter storms from the beginning of the year to the end of January. Midwest schools seem to be the most heavily affected. Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest district in the U.S., closed for two days in early January for the first time in five years.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Yes, you can use the Go programming language to generate a PDF file from a LaTeX document. Here is an example code that shows how to do this using the GoTeX package:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"os/exec"
)
func main() {
	// Read the LaTeX file
	latex, err := ioutil.ReadFile("harry_potter.tex")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	// Run pdflatex to generate the PDF file
	cmd := exec.Command("pdflatex", "-output-directory=pdf", "-jobname=harry_potter", "-interaction=batchmode")
	cmd.Stdin = bytes.NewReader(latex)
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
	err = cmd.Run()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("PDF file generated successfully!")
}
```
This code reads the contents of the LaTeX file "harry_potter.tex", runs pdflatex to generate the PDF file, and saves it in the "pdf" directory with the name "harry_potter.pdf". You can modify the code to suit your needs, such as changing the input file name, output directory, or pdflatex options.</span></div></div>

is this the correct template for a basic nested loop?

</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Not quite. Your current code is a mix of a recursive function and a nested loop. Here's an example of how you can create a nested loop that works with `sample`:


```
(define sample '("a" "b" "c"))

(define (run-this lst)
  (define (inner-loop inner-lst)
    (if (null? inner-lst)
        'done
        (begin
          (display (car inner-lst))
          (inner-loop (cdr inner-lst)))))
  
  (if (null? lst)
      'done
      (begin
        (display (car lst))
        (inner-loop (cdr lst))
        (run-this (cdr lst)))))
```


Here, we define a function `run-this` that takes a list as input. Within it, we define another function `inner-loop` that takes a list as input. 

The `run-this` function uses a basic loop template: we first check if the list is empty, in which case we terminate the loop and return `done`. Otherwise, we perform some action (in this case, displaying the current element of `lst`), and then move on to the next element of the list by recursively calling `run-this` on the remainder of the list (`cdr lst`).

The `inner-loop` function is called for each element of `lst`, and performs a similar loop: it checks if the list is empty, and terminates if so. Otherwise, it performs some action (in this case, displaying the current element of `inner-lst`), and then moves on to the next element of the list in the same way.

Together, these two nested loops allow us to traverse each element of `sample` and each element of each element of `sample`.

Here's an example of how you can call this function:


```
(run-this sample)
;; Output:
;; a
;; b
;; c
```


Note that this function assumes that every element of `lst` is either a string or a list of strings - if this is not the case, you may need to modify the function to handle other types of elements.</span></div></div>

They prioritize the creation of a democratic Jewish state that values equality for all citizens, regardless of religion or ethnicity.

For example I have the following code:



```
    Thread t = new Thread() {
        public boolean alive = true;
        public void run() {
            while (alive) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(5000);    
                    getNewNotifications();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    //  Do nothing
                } catch (IOException e) {
                } 
            }
        }
    };
    t.start()

```

The function getNewNotification() does some several Rest/HTTP calls, that may include some other process that may return indefinitely. I have read the `Task Queue` is the solution, however how do we convert this simple code into App engine-friendly code? 


How is the code above implemented using Task queue? For example to call `getNewNotifications()` for every five seconds.


And that function will get some results from the server, parse the result and then execute the activities/work it needs to do based on the result. 

</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To migrate existing multithreaded code to App Engine, you can use the Task Queue API. The Task Queue API provides a way to execute code asynchronously on App Engine. Rather than running code in a separate thread, you create a task and put it on the task queue. The task is then picked up and executed asynchronously by the App Engine infrastructure.

Here's how you can convert your code to use the Task Queue API:

1. Define a new servlet or handler that will handle the task. For example:

```java
public class MyTaskHandler extends HttpServlet {
 public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
 throws ServletException, IOException {
 // Do work here
 }
}
```

2. Replace the `t.start()` call with a call to the Task Queue API. For example:

```java
Queue queue = QueueFactory.getQueue("my-queue");
queue.add(TaskOptions.Builder.withUrl("/tasks/mytask"));
```

This will enqueue a task to be executed by the `MyTaskHandler` servlet.

3. Rewrite the `getNewNotifications()` method to be fully self-contained and to not rely on the `alive` flag. Instead, the method should return immediately and the results should be processed by the task handler. For example:

```java
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
 throws ServletException, IOException {
 List notifications = getNewNotificationsFromServer();
 processNotifications(notifications);
}
```

Note that in this example, the `getNewNotificationsFromServer()` method is now blocking and will wait for the server to return. If the server returns slowly or not at all, the task may take a long time to complete.

4. To schedule the task to run every five seconds, use a cron job to enqueue a new task at the desired interval. For example:

```xml

/tasks/mytask
Do something every 5 seconds
every 5s

```

This will enqueue a new task every five seconds that will be picked up and executed by the `MyTaskHandler` servlet.

Note that the Task Queue API has some limitations compared to multithreading, such as increased latency and lack of control over the execution environment. However, it is a powerful tool for building scalable and reliable applications on App Engine.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To dynamically create or remove form fields based on user input, you can use iTextSharp or Adobe Acrobat DC. 

With iTextSharp, you can use the PDFStamper to add or remove form fields. You can accomplish this by first loading the PDF form, then utilizing the AcroFields class to get access to the individual form fields. From there, you can add or remove fields using the appropriate API methods. Once you have made your changes, you can save the modified PDF form using the PDFStamper.

Here is an example using iTextSharp:


```
// Load PDF form
PdfReader reader = new PdfReader("originalForm.pdf");
PdfStamper stamper = new PdfStamper(reader, new FileStream("modifiedForm.pdf", FileMode.Create));

// Get access to form fields
AcroFields form = stamper.AcroFields;

// Dynamically create form fields based on user input
for (int i = 0; i &lt; transactions.length; i++) 
{
    // Insert transaction title text
    form.SetField("title" + i, "Transaction " + i);

    // Insert transaction field
    form.AddSingleLineTextField("transaction" + i, "");

    // Insert transaction amount field
    form.AddSingleLineTextField("amount" + i, "");
}

// Remove form fields based on user input
if (transactions.length == 0) 
{
    form.RemoveField("title0");
    form.RemoveField("transaction0");
    form.RemoveField("amount0");
}

// Close PDF stamper
stamper.Close();
reader.Close();

```


With Adobe Acrobat DC, you can use the Actions Wizard to set up custom JavaScript that responds to user input. In Acrobat, you can go to Tools > Action Wizard > Create New Action > Custom Sequence. From there, you can add JavaScript actions to add, remove, or modify form fields based on user input.

Here is an example JavaScript for Acrobat:


```
// Get access to form fields
var form = this.getField("form");

// Dynamically create form fields based on user input
for (var i = 0; i &lt; transactions.length; i++) 
{
    // Insert transaction title text
    form.addField("title" + i, "text", i, [10, 10, 50, 20]);

    // Insert transaction field
    form.addField("transaction" + i, "text", i + 1, [60, 10, 100, 20]);

    // Insert transaction amount field
    form.addField("amount" + i, "text", i + 2, [110, 10, 150, 20]);
}

// Remove form fields based on user input
if (transactions.length == 0) 
{
    form.removeField("title0");
    form.removeField("transaction0");
    form.removeField("amount0");
}

```


Overall, both iTextSharp and Adobe Acrobat DC provide options for dynamically creating or removing form fields based on user input. It'll depend on your specific needs and preferences as to which solution you'll want to use.</span></div></div>

Eli Manning threw his 300th career touchdown to Roger Lewis late in the second quarter. The Giants stormed on points with an Odell Beckham Jr. 75-yard touchdown followed by a Justin Tucker field goal to make the game 20-16. The Giants then stopped Terrance West on 4th and goal early in the 4th quarter. Late in the 4th quarter, the Ravens drove down the field and scored making the game 23-20. Eli Manning and the Giants responded with Eli completing a 66-yard touchdown to Beckham to make the score 27-23. The Ravens drove down the field but were stopped with Joe Flacco throwing an incompletion in the final seconds allowing the Giants to break their three-game losing streak. The Giants improved to 3-3, and their all-time record against the Ravens improved to 2-4. This win was also the Giants 700th win in franchise history. This game started a six-game winning streak for the Giants that would last until Week 13.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To set the tablename as a variable in a SQL statement, you can use dynamic SQL. Here's an example that should work for you:


```
DECLARE
   tbname   VARCHAR2 (200);
   v_sql    VARCHAR2 (4000);
   refcur   SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
   SELECT '"data_' || REPLACE (TO_CHAR (SYSDATE - 1, 'yyyy.mm.dd'), '.', '') || '"@myDB'
   INTO   tbname
   FROM   DUAL;
   
   v_sql := 'SELECT * FROM ' || tbname;
   OPEN refcur FOR v_sql;
   -- use refcur to fetch data or do whatever you need to do with the result set
END;

```


In this example, we first declare the variable tbname and use a SELECT statement to set its value to the table name we want to use. Next, we define a SQL statement as a string variable v\_sql, using the table name variable in the statement. Finally, we open a cursor using the dynamic SQL statement and can use the cursor to fetch data or do whatever we need to do with the result set.

Note that using dynamic SQL in this way can be a security risk if the table name variable is not properly validated. It's recommended to validate the variable or use bind variables in your SQL statements to avoid SQL injection attacks.</span></div></div>
