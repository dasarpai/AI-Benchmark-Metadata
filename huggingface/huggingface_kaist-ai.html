Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine).\n\nNow answer this question: Where do some medicines and recreational drugs come from?&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;from plants&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The article states that many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants.

He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.

He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show.\n\nSkelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.  Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's Loew's State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the \&quot;Doughnut Dunkers\&quot; routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.  The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \&quot;Doughnut Dunkers\&quot; and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, \&quot;Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once.\&quot; His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.\n\nEntity:&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Red Skelton&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The text is about Red Skelton.

The term redhead (originally redd hede) has been in use since at least 1510.

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.\nAlthough Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \&quot;are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\&quot;. The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \&quot;the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\&quot;. The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\n\nand the situation: Two siblings were going to school. Mary experienced headaches, so he was sent to the eye doctor. The doctor concluded she was nearsighted and prescribed her eyeglasses. Ben had normal vision.\n\nAnswer the following question: Which sibling didn't have a difficulty seeing distant objects?&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Ben&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;One of the common signs of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects. Since Mary was diagnosed with myopia, it can be concluded that she is most likely having trouble seeing things in the distance.

He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother, Grace, reprimands him for it. Grace slaps him, and he later yells at Beth, asking her why she didn't defend him. He ends up throwing her doll into the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey jumps up and down on the diving board, causing her to fall into the pool and drown.\nHe goes upstairs to the bathroom, where he overhears Grace taking a bath and telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey might have been a mistake. The phone dies, and Grace notices Mikey standing in front of the tub. Startled, she chides him for not knocking before he came in. He accuses Grace and Harold of not loving him anymore, but she denies that, saying they both love him very much. However, Mikey doesn't believe her; he picks up her blow dryer, turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it into the water and she is instantly electrocuted.\nMikey goes downstairs and pours marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he calmly goes to greet him. They sit and talk for a moment until Harold sees his daughter floating lifelessly in the pool. He rushes towards the door, but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. After Harold crashes through the door panel, Mikey proceeds to kill him by beating him in the head with a baseball bat. It is then revealed that Mikey has been taping the murders in secret. Soon after that, the police have arrived to investigate the murders and they finally finds Mikey \&quot;hiding\&quot; in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family.\nA psychiatrist recommends that Mikey be fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \&quot;never sold [anything]\&quot; compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \&quot;pod\&quot; evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., can you guess it ?&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Deal&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The article mentions Deal and Donelly.

Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s, OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe. Since 2011, the company's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40% stake, while the Greek state continues to own 10% of the company's shares.

Before his inauguration, President Obama published an open letter to his daughters in Parade magazine, describing what he wants them and every child in America \&quot;to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world.\&quot;\nWhile living in Chicago, they kept busy schedules. Soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha, piano and tennis for both. Malia and Sasha attended the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC. The Obama girls began classes there on January 5, 2009. In his victory speech on the night of his election, President Obama repeated his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a dog to take with them to the White House. On April 12, 2009, it was reported that the Obamas had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese water dog given to them as a gift. The dog was named Bo by Malia and Sasha.\nThough Malia and Sasha Obama are the president's kids, it doesn't mean they'll be catered to. The girls are still required to do their chores. Besides bed-making, Malia and Sasha must clean up their rooms and keep on top of their homework.

In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound.\nLate Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \&quot;This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\&quot; he told supporters.\nMoore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s.\nMoore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \&quot;We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\&quot;\nMoore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore.\nThe president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result.\n\&quot;I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\&quot; he said. \&quot;But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\&quot;\nJones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes.\nQuestion: Who won Tuesday's election?\nOptions:\n\nA. Doug Jones\n\nB.

It also mentions Trump's endorsement for Moore and his reaction to the result of the race, so it can be inferred that he was not a candidate in this particular election. Therefore, Jones is the correct answer choice here because he was specifically named as winning Tuesday's (Alabama) Senate seat: \&quot;In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore.\&quot;&quot;},&quot;task&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;quail&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;CoT&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:28,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is the most fluent with respect to continuing the prompt.

This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.\n\nSerotonin 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT(2C)Rs) are almost exclusively expressed in the CNS, and implicated in disorders such as obesity, depression, and schizophrenia. The present study investigated the mechanisms governing the coupling of the 5-HT(2C)R to the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1/2, using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the receptor at levels comparable to those found in the brain. Using the non-RNA-edited isoform of the 5-HT(2C)R, constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed and found to be modulated by full, partial and inverse agonists. Interestingly, agonist-directed trafficking of receptor stimulus was also observed when comparing effects on phosphoinositide accumulation and intracellular Ca2+ elevation to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereby the agonists, [+/-]-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and quipazine, showed reversal of efficacy between the phosphoinositide/Ca2+ pathways, on the one hand, and the ERK1/2 pathway on the other. Subsequent molecular characterization found that 5-HT-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in this cellular background requires phospholipase D, protein kinase C, and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK module, but is independent of both receptor- and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and endocytosis. Our findings underscore the potential for exploiting pathway-selective receptor states in the differential modulation of signaling pathways that play prominent roles in normal and abnormal neuronal signaling.&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;False&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The abstract does not have a clear topic sentence, supporting sentences, or closing sentence.

These stories can be difficult due to their length and how each story has at least one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios.

The second scenario is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. This also does not apply because there are no cases of this happening in this story.

They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends. J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L. 90–351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees.

As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage.\nBorn and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \&quot;Our Song\&quot;, made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \&quot;Love Story\&quot; and \&quot;You Belong with Me\&quot;, Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner.\nSwift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \&quot;Mean\&quot; won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \&quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\&quot; and \&quot;I Knew You Were Trouble\&quot;. For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \&quot;Shake It Off\&quot;, \&quot;Blank Space\&quot;, and \&quot;Bad Blood\&quot; reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \&quot;Look What You Made Me Do\&quot; topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.\nSwift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums—including 27.8 million in the US—and 150 million single downloads.

Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;food&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The question mentions a rat, cat and food.\nIn the context, it does not mention that these are mammals but we can infer that they are based on their description in relation to other animals with smaller brains. We go further into detail about intelligence among primates vs non-primates such as plants and insects by talking about how intelligent monkeys appear due to them being able to learn new tasks. The author proceeds by pointing out certain characteristics of rats which make them highly intelligent (being able to perform new tasks).  Lastly, the author points out that hunting is related directly with brain size where big cats who must think smartly to catch prey have larger brains than deer or even plants whose main form of existence is through photosynthesis rather than eating grass or plant matter for nourishment(food).

Passage:A native of New York City, Aschheim lived in California and Singapore as a girl. She studied art at the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her BA in 1984; in 1987 she received her MFA at the University of California, Davis. In 2003 she became director of the Visual Arts Program at Princeton University, where she began teaching in 1991. During her career she has received fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Elizabeth Foundation, and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and she has been awarded the Purchase Award and the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Award, both from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2012. In 2017 she was elected an Academician of the National Academy of Design. Aschheim's paintings and drawings are abstract and heavily geometric. Three of her works, including one formerly owned by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, are in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, while six are owned by the Museum of Modern Art.

This is not a school sanctioned activity it is something that she is personally doing \n\nShe’s invited a majority of the senior class (our class is pretty small with only 102 seniors) with the exception of some kids. Most of these kids not invited are kids she considers unpopular or just doesn’t like. One boy came up to me and said he and his friends would like to attend and asked for the location of the cookout. He told me that he, along with a lot of other kids didn’t get invitations to attend. I told him he’d have to ask her if they could go but he asked me if I could ask on their behalf since I know her better. \n\nThey kept on asking me for the location and time and I kept telling them to ask her. They kept bothering me until I told them that she didn’t like them and didn’t want them there or else they would’ve been invited. I told them I didn’t feel like making a case for them because she’d just get mad and tell me that since she planned it she decides who goes and who doesn’t.

The excluded students have been bugging the author, asking her to ask on their behalf if they can come and telling her that many other kids were also excluded.

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre-and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir®. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.&quot;},&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in children undergoing heart surgery&quot;},&quot;rationale&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The paper focuses on the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in children undergoing heart surgery.

The kids suddenly turn against everything around them and trash the apartment to complete annihilation. The kids are called \&quot;Destruction Incorporated\&quot;, a bunch of self-imposed derelicts who terrorize a sleepy Florida town. They are led by the near-psychotic Dexter, his pal Denny, Denny's girlfriend Bitsy, and their friend Lummox. Their reason for forming this so-called \&quot;destruction crew\&quot; is as Dexter states: \&quot;just for the hell of it.\&quot;\nDexter, Denny, Bitsy, and Lummox stop at a local neighborhood bar for a few drinks when the bartender becomes irritated with their shenanigans and orders them to be quiet to which they respond by beating up the owner. Afterwards, Dexter and a few of the Destruction crew pile into Dexter's 1967 white Mustang car and drive around town terrorizing and harassing the locals. One teenybopper steals a lady's newspaper and sets fire to it. A man is splashed painted when a few other youths throw paint at him. Also, a police officer is contemptuously taunted.\nAt a corner coffee shop, the overly zealous teens engage in a bloody fist fight with another teenager, named Doug, who used to know Dexter and was part of his gang before walking away years ago.

Hardman (Colin Blakely), an American theatrical agent.\nThe morning after the train's departure from Istanbul, Ratchett tries to secure Poirot's services for $15,000 since he has received many death threats, but Poirot finds the case of little interest and turns it down. That night the train is caught in heavy snows in the Balkans. Poirot is disturbed numerous times during the night. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin. Poirot and Bianchi work together to solve the case. They enlist the help of Dr. Constantine (George Coulouris), a Greek medical doctor who was travelling in another coach with Bianchi as the only other passenger and thus is not a suspect. Pierre Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the French conductor of the car, also assists the investigation, as well as being a suspect.\nDr. Constantine's examination reveals Ratchett was stabbed 12 times.

Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine).

Now answer this question: Where do some medicines and recreational drugs come from?</span></div></div>

Richard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913 - September 17, 1997) was an American comedy entertainer. He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show.

Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.  Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's Loew's State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.  The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once." His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.

Context: "Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term redhead (originally redd hede) has been in use since at least 1510. Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered. (See red hair)."

When Zach arrived, he asked if Bradley wanted to drive his car. Bradley had a driver's license. Bradley said all right. Zach told him not to drive fast, but that he could drive anywhere he wanted. Bradley got on the road. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips: Don't drive next to big trucks, because you never know when they might crush  you. Don't drive behind trucks filled with things, because you never know when something in the truck will fly out and hit your car.
On their way back, Zach suggested that they stop at the golf course. He wanted to show Bradley how to play golf. Bradley wasn't interested. He preferred his video games. But Bradley soon discovered that golf was fun! He hit a lot of balls. Zach told him that he was doing well. The next day Bradley, for the first time ever, called Zach.

Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.
Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels "are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by "the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers. Although the triptych...</span></div></div>

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

and the situation: Two siblings were going to school. Mary experienced headaches, so he was sent to the eye doctor. The doctor concluded she was nearsighted and prescribed her eyeglasses. Ben had normal vision.

He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother, Grace, reprimands him for it. Grace slaps him, and he later yells at Beth, asking her why she didn't defend him. He ends up throwing her doll into the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey jumps up and down on the diving board, causing her to fall into the pool and drown.
He goes upstairs to the bathroom, where he overhears Grace taking a bath and telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey might have been a mistake. The phone dies, and Grace notices Mikey standing in front of the tub. Startled, she chides him for not knocking before he came in. He accuses Grace and Harold of not loving him anymore, but she denies that, saying they both love him very much. However, Mikey doesn't believe her; he picks up her blow dryer, turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it into the water and she is instantly electrocuted.
Mikey goes downstairs and pours marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he calmly goes to greet him. They sit and talk for a moment until Harold sees his daughter floating lifelessly in the pool. He rushes towards the door, but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. After Harold crashes through the door panel, Mikey proceeds to kill him by beating him in the head with a baseball bat. It is then revealed that Mikey has been taping the murders in secret. Soon after that, the police have arrived to investigate the murders and they finally finds Mikey "hiding" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family.
A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey be fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted, and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family., can you guess it ?</span></div></div>

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it "never sold [anything]" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word "pod" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., can you guess it ?</span></div></div>

Article: Barack and Michelle Obama have two daughters: Malia, born in 1998, and Sasha, born in 2001. Before his inauguration, President Obama published an open letter to his daughters in Parade magazine, describing what he wants them and every child in America "to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world."
While living in Chicago, they kept busy schedules. Soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha, piano and tennis for both. Malia and Sasha attended the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC. The Obama girls began classes there on January 5, 2009. In his victory speech on the night of his election, President Obama repeated his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a dog to take with them to the White House. On April 12, 2009, it was reported that the Obamas had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese water dog given to them as a gift. The dog was named Bo by Malia and Sasha.
Though Malia and Sasha Obama are the president's kids, it doesn't mean they'll be catered to. The girls are still required to do their chores. Besides bed-making, Malia and Sasha must clean up their rooms and keep on top of their homework. The Obamas want their girls to grow up in a "normal" way.

Context: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama.
In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound.
Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. "This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!" he told supporters.
Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s.
Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, "We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do."
Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore.
The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result.
"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out," he said. "But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running."
Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes.
Question: Who won Tuesday's election?
Options:

A. Doug Jones

B. Roy Moore

C. not enough information

D. Donald Trump</span></div></div>

In the first quarter, Pittsburgh struck first with QB Ben Roethlisberger completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller.  Afterwards, the Broncos responded with QB Jay Cutler completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley.  In the second quarter, the Steelers struggled as Cutler completed a 1-yard TD pass to FB Cecil Sapp, along with DE Tim Crowder returning a fumble 50&amp;#160;yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh tried to recover with Roethlisberger completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes, but the Broncos answered with Cutler completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh managed to tie the game with Roethlisberger completing a 13-yard TD pass to rookie TE Matt Spaeth, along with a 12-yard TD pass to Miller.  Unfortunately, Denver managed to get kicker Jason Elam to nail a last-second 49-yard field goal. Pittsburgh's defense, which had given up only 5 touchdowns in their first 5 games, gave up 3 on the night.

Serotonin 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT(2C)Rs) are almost exclusively expressed in the CNS, and implicated in disorders such as obesity, depression, and schizophrenia. The present study investigated the mechanisms governing the coupling of the 5-HT(2C)R to the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1/2, using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the receptor at levels comparable to those found in the brain. Using the non-RNA-edited isoform of the 5-HT(2C)R, constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed and found to be modulated by full, partial and inverse agonists. Interestingly, agonist-directed trafficking of receptor stimulus was also observed when comparing effects on phosphoinositide accumulation and intracellular Ca2+ elevation to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereby the agonists, [+/-]-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and quipazine, showed reversal of efficacy between the phosphoinositide/Ca2+ pathways, on the one hand, and the ERK1/2 pathway on the other. Subsequent molecular characterization found that 5-HT-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in this cellular background requires phospholipase D, protein kinase C, and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK module, but is independent of both receptor- and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and endocytosis. Our findings underscore the potential for exploiting pathway-selective receptor states in the differential modulation of signaling pathways that play prominent roles in normal and abnormal neuronal signaling.</span></div></div>

6 weeks or more since you mailed your return, or when Where's My Refund tells you to contact the IRS; Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit may experience a refund hold. According to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act, the IRS cannot issue these refunds before mid-February. Here’s what you need to know to predict how long you’ll need to wait for your refund.

FBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States. They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends. J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L. 90–351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees. As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover, only to his successors. The current FBI Director is James B. Comey, who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage.
Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner.
Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single "Mean" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single "Look What You Made Me Do" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.
Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums—including 27.8 million in the US—and 150 million single downloads. As a songwriter, she has...</span></div></div>

Question: Which of the following is not a mammal: rat, cat, or food?
Context: In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.</span></div></div>

In the context, it does not mention that these are mammals but we can infer that they are based on their description in relation to other animals with smaller brains. We go further into detail about intelligence among primates vs non-primates such as plants and insects by talking about how intelligent monkeys appear due to them being able to learn new tasks. The author proceeds by pointing out certain characteristics of rats which make them highly intelligent (being able to perform new tasks).  Lastly, the author points out that hunting is related directly with brain size where big cats who must think smartly to catch prey have larger brains than deer or even plants whose main form of existence is through photosynthesis rather than eating grass or plant matter for nourishment(food).

Question: The inventor of the low voltage electrolytic capacitator with porous carbon electrodes believed?
Context: Last but not least the electric double-layer capacitor (now Supercapacitors) were invented. In 1957 H. Becker developed a "Low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes". He believed that the energy was stored as a charge in the carbon pores used in his capacitor as in the pores of the etched foils of electrolytic capacitors. Because the double layer mechanism was not known by him at the time, he wrote in the patent: "It is not known exactly what is taking place in the component if it is used for energy storage, but it leads to an extremely high capacity.".</span></div></div>

Article: US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey surprised 300 members of her audience    by saying she would send them on a trip to Australia in December.Winfrey will also film an episode   of her show at the Sydney "Oprah" House.
The Australian government said it was spending AUS$  3 million to help bring The Oprah Winfrey Show to the country.
Tourism Minister   Martin Ferguson insisted it was money well spent as it would put Australia in the spotlight,with the popular TV show watched by 40 million Americans and screened in 145 countries."Oprah is a famous name and she has the power to improve Australia's image as an important tourist country," he said in a statement.
Winfrey made the announcement on Monday.After telling the audience that she might take them on a trip to New York,Philadelphia or Los Angeles,she said  her  last  season  would  provide  something "bigger".
"I started to think about where I would most want to go.Maybe I should take all of you with me to the other side of the world.We're going to Australia!"she said.
Several episodes will be filmed during the trip,which had been planned for almost a year and will take in beaches,Sydney Harbour and so on.It marks the first time that the show will be filmed with its US audience outside North America.The Australian trip follows a similar act in 2004 when Winfrey gave a car to each member of her audience.
Winfrey is to start her own television channel  ,the Oprah Winfrey Network,in 2011,at the age of her 57.
Question: What might be the best title for the text?
Options: A: Oprah Winfrey takes audience to Australia
B: Australians love to see The Oprah Winfrey Show
C: Americans want to know more about Australia
D: Oprah Winfrey will start her own channel</span></div></div>

D: Oprah Winfrey will start her own channel


The best title for the text is A, because that's what the article says. We can find out from reading it that she wants all of us go with her and watch episodes there. So we choose "Oprah Winfrey take audience to Australia" as the best title."Australians love to see..." has nothing related in the whole passage, so this choice is not correct; and if we read carefully again, maybe C would be wrong too since it talks a lot about how much money they spend on bringing show here ,and also talk something like Australian government said....</span></div></div>

Some girl in our senior class is planning a cookout at a lake for senior skip day in a couple of weeks. She’s rented pavilions , will provide some of the food (you have to bring something if you want to attend) and is doing most of the planning for it along with her friends. This is not a school sanctioned activity it is something that she is personally doing 

She’s invited a majority of the senior class (our class is pretty small with only 102 seniors) with the exception of some kids. Most of these kids not invited are kids she considers unpopular or just doesn’t like. One boy came up to me and said he and his friends would like to attend and asked for the location of the cookout. He told me that he, along with a lot of other kids didn’t get invitations to attend. I told him he’d have to ask her if they could go but he asked me if I could ask on their behalf since I know her better. 

They kept on asking me for the location and time and I kept telling them to ask her. They kept bothering me until I told them that she didn’t like them and didn’t want them there or else they would’ve been invited. I told them I didn’t feel like making a case for them because she’d just get mad and tell me that since she planned it she decides who goes and who doesn’t. I feel like she has a point it’s not right for me to force her to invite people she doesn’t want. I wanted to avoid an argument I knew I was going to lose so I just let them get excluded AITA?</span></div></div>

The excluded students have been bugging the author, asking her to ask on their behalf if they can come and telling her that many other kids were also excluded. However, even though it might be nice if everyone was included in this event, there does not seem to be anything wrong with organizing an event that some people will enjoy while others will feel left out by. While it would be better if everyone could go or no one went at all, it seems like everyone is acting within their rights in this situation.

Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain. If distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. Emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).

Background: Acute viral respiratory infections (VRI) are the most common diseases in humans and are associated with high morbidity and mortality in infants and the elderly. Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre-and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir®. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.</span></div></div>

The opening scene is set at a wild teenage party in a small apartment. The kids suddenly turn against everything around them and trash the apartment to complete annihilation. The kids are called "Destruction Incorporated", a bunch of self-imposed derelicts who terrorize a sleepy Florida town. They are led by the near-psychotic Dexter, his pal Denny, Denny's girlfriend Bitsy, and their friend Lummox. Their reason for forming this so-called "destruction crew" is as Dexter states: "just for the hell of it."
Dexter, Denny, Bitsy, and Lummox stop at a local neighborhood bar for a few drinks when the bartender becomes irritated with their shenanigans and orders them to be quiet to which they respond by beating up the owner. Afterwards, Dexter and a few of the Destruction crew pile into Dexter's 1967 white Mustang car and drive around town terrorizing and harassing the locals. One teenybopper steals a lady's newspaper and sets fire to it. A man is splashed painted when a few other youths throw paint at him. Also, a police officer is contemptuously taunted.
At a corner coffee shop, the overly zealous teens engage in a bloody fist fight with another teenager, named Doug, who used to know Dexter and was part of his gang before walking away years ago. As result of the rumble, the group begins to trash the place. The proprietor threatens to call the police, but is cut short when one of the teenyboppers punches him in the face. Dexter and Denny, aided by other Destruction crew, cruelly drag the owner to the stove and they unmercifully burn his hands on the hot stove.</span></div></div>

Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted.

<p>The CoT Collection is a dataset designed to induce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities into language models.
While proprietary LLMs excel at generating Chain-of-Thoughts based on prompting, smaller LMs do not have this capability. Thus, by fine-tuning to generate Chain-of-Thoughts, it could acquire such abilities.</p>
<p>The CoT Collection provides 1.84 million Chain-of-Thoughts augmented across 1060 tasks from the Flan Collection.\
Experimental results show that fine-tuning on the CoT Collection results in (1) better zero-shot performance and (2) a better base model for few-shot learning.</p>
<p>We also provide a multilingual version of CoT Collection at this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multilingual-CoT-Collection">link</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>source: The input that is given to the language model (LM).</li>
<li>target: The ground truth answer to the source.</li>
<li>rationale: The Chain of Thought (CoT) that explains how the target could be derived from the source.</li>
<li>task: A category that shows which dataset the source and target was extracted from.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our paper, we trained the underlying language model to generate in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>\{rationale\}
[RESULT]
\{target\}
</code></pre>
<p>Then during evaluation, we parsed the prediction after the phrase <code>[RESULT]</code>.</p>
