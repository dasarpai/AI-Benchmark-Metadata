Oh, that we may learn to die to all that is of self with this royal joyfulness that swallows up death in victory in God's world around!\&quot;,\n        \&quot; IT IS IN THE AUTUMN WHEN THE HARVEST IS GATHERED AND THE FRUIT IS STORED FOR THE USE OF MAN THAT THE GLOW OF RED AND GOLD TOUCHES AND TRANSFIGURES BUSH AND TREE WITH A BEAUTY THAT THE SUMMER DAYS NEVER KNEW SO WITH US THE CLEAR PURE DAWN OF CLEANSING THROUGH THE BLOOD THE SUNRISE GLADNESS OF RESURRECTION LIFE THE MID DAY LIGHT AND WARMTH OF GROWTH AND SERVICE ALL ARE GOOD IN THEIR OWN ORDER BUT HE WHO STOPS SHORT THERE MISSES THE CROWN OF GLORY BEFORE WHICH THE BRIGHTNESS OF FORMER DAYS GROWS POOR AND COLD IT IS WHEN THE GLOW AND RADIANCE OF A LIFE DELIVERED UP TO DEATH BEGINS TO GATHER A LIFE POURED FORTH TO JESUS AND FOR HIS SAKE TO OTHERS IT IS THEN THAT EVEN THE COMMONEST THINGS PUT ON A NEW BEAUTY AS IN THE SUNSET FOR HIS LIFE BECOMES MANIFEST IN OUR MORTAL FLESH A BLOOM COMES ON THE SOUL LIKE THE BLOOM ON THE FRUIT AS ITS HOUR OF SACRIFICE ARRIVES O THAT WE MAY LEARN TO DIE TO ALL THAT IS OF SELF WITH THIS ROYAL JOYFULNESS THAT SWALLOWS UP DEATH AND VICTORY IN GOD'S WORLD AROUND\&quot;\n      ],\n      \&quot;begin_byte\&quot;: 32605,\n      \&quot;end_byte\&quot;: 32852\n    }\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;recording&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;large/10173/parablesofthecross_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3/parablesofthecross_1_trotter_64kb\&quot;,\n  \&quot;sources\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;file\&quot;,\n      \&quot;channels\&quot;: [\n        0\n      ],\n      \&quot;source\&quot;: \&quot;download/librilight/large/10173/parablesofthecross_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3/parablesofthecross_1_trotter_64kb.flac\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;sampling_rate\&quot;: 16000,\n  \&quot;num_samples\&quot;: 45601037,\n  \&quot;duration\&quot;: 2850.0648125,\n  \&quot;channel_ids\&quot;: [\n    0\n  ]\n}&quot;},&quot;custom&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;{\n  \&quot;text_path\&quot;: \&quot;download/librilight_text/output_text_large_cleaned/Parables of the Cross/text.txt\&quot;\n}&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;MonoCut&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;large/10173/parablesofthecross_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3/parablesofthecross_1_trotter_64kb_194&quot;},&quot;start&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1126.8000625,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;1,126.800063&quot;},&quot;duration&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:26.319,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;26.319&quot;},&quot;channel&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;supervisions&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;large/10173/parablesofthecross_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3/parablesofthecross_1_trotter_64kb_194&quot;,&quot;recording_id&quot;:&quot;large/10173/parablesofthecross_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3/parablesofthecross_1_trotter_64kb&quot;,&quot;start&quot;:0,&quot;duration&quot;:26.319,&quot;channel&quot;:0,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;English&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:&quot;10173&quot;,&quot;custom&quot;:{&quot;texts&quot;:[&quot;The flowers that are bent on perfecting themselves, by becoming double, end in barrenness, and a like barrenness comes to the soul whose interests are all concentrated upon its own spiritual well being, heedless of the needs around.

Now, though Curly did not know it, this was a bad egg dog--that is, he liked to eat eggs raw, without ever boiling or frying them, and that kind of a dog is the worst there is.

Parties in wit attend on those of state, And public faction doubles private hate.

Bursts out, resistless, with a thundering tide, But where's the man who counsel can bestow, Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know? Unbiased, or by favor, or in spite, Not dully prepossessed, nor blindly right; Though learned, well-bred, and though well bred, sincere, Modestly bold, and humanly severe, Who to a friend his faults can freely show, And gladly praise the merit of a foe? Blessed with a taste exact, yet unconfined; A knowledge both of books and human kind; Generous converse, a soul exempt from pride; And love to praise, with reason on his side?",

Blessed with a taste exact, yet unconfined; A knowledge both of books and human kind; Generous converse, a soul exempt from pride; And love to praise, with reason on his side?

So with us--The clear pure dawn of cleansing through the Blood--the sunrise gladness of resurrection life; the mid-day light and warmth of growth and service, all are good in their own order: but he who stops short there misses the crown of glory, before which the brightness of former days grows poor and cold. It is when the glow and radiance of a life delivered up to death begins to gather: a life poured forth to Jesus and for His sake to others--it is then that even the commonest things put on a new beauty, as in the sunset, for His life becomes \"manifest in our mortal flesh;\" a bloom comes on the soul like the bloom on the fruit as its hour of sacrifice arrives.",

You have told Him that you want Him only. Are you ready to ratify the words when His emptying begins to come? Is God enough? Is it still \"My God\" that you cry, even as Jesus cried when nothing else was left Him? Yes, practical death with Him to lawful things is just letting go, even as He on the Cross let go all but God. It is not to be reached by struggling for it, but simply by yielding as the body yields at last to the physical death that lays hold on it--as the dying calyx yields its flower.",

And to a soul that through \"deaths oft\" has been brought to this point, even acts that look as if they must involve an effort, become something natural, spontaneous, full of a \"heavenly involuntariness,\" so simply are they the outcome of the indwelling love of Christ. Shall we not ask God to convict us, as to where lies the hindrance to this self-emptying? It is not alone mere selfishness, in its ordinary sense, that prevents it; long after this has been cleansed away by the Precious Blood there may remain, unrecognised, the self-life in more subtle forms. It may co-exist with much that looks like sacrifice; there may be much of usefulness and of outward self-denial, and yet below the surface may remain a clinging to our own judgment, a confidence in our own resources, an unconscious taking of our own way, even in God's service. And these things hold down, hold in our souls, and frustrate the Spirit in His working.",

No matter if we feel utterly helpless before that lovely life of His. Given the conditions--the hidden power within, and the old outlets of growth shut off--the sun will do the rest; out of the midst of apparent lifelessness, of barrenness, of difficulty, the blossoms will be drawn forth. Do not let us \"limit the Holy One of Israel\" by putting off His power to work this miracle into a distant future. How hopeless the naked wood of a fruit tree would look to us in February if we had never seen the marvel of springtime! Yet the heavenly bloom bursts straight out, with hardly an intermediate step of new growth. Look again at a flowering rush. The crest breaks forth from nothingness--out of the lifeless-seeming pith come crowding the golden brown blossoms, till there is hardly \"room to receive\" them. What more do we need for our souls than to have this God for our God?",

Every stage of the heavenly growth in us is lovely to Him; He is the God of the daisies and the lambs and the merry child hearts! It may be that no such path of loss lies before you; there are people like the lands where spring and summer weave the year between them, and the autumn processes are hardly noticed as they come and go. The one thing is to keep obedient in spirit, then you will be ready to let the flower-time pass if He bids you, when the sun of His love has worked some more ripening. You will feel by then that to try to keep the withering blossoms would be to cramp and ruin your soul. It is loss to keep when God says 'give'. For here again death is the gate of life: it is an entering in, not a going forth only; it means a liberating of new powers as the former treasures float away like the dying petals.",

Have we learnt to go down, once and again, into its gathering shadows in quietness and confidence, knowing that there is always \"a better resurrection\" beyond? It is in the stages of a plant's growth, its budding and blossoming and seed-bearing, that this lesson has come to me: the lesson of death in its delivering power.

Just there He can bring your soul into blossom! * * * * * * * * And so the spring-time expands, till it passes once more into the shadow of Calvary. For the blessedness of receiving is not all that God has for us: a new world lies beyond--a world of giving: a giving first to God in surrender, then to man in sacrifice. A flower that stops short at its flowering misses its purpose. We were created for more than our own spiritual development; reproduction, not mere development, is the goal of matured being--reproduction in other lives. There is a tendency in some characters, running parallel to the high cultivation that spends its whole energy on the production of bloom at the expense of seed. ",

I'll just fasten him by his tail.\" And that's what he did, tying the poor little piggie to the fence by his tail, with a piece of wild grape vine for a string.

It's no fun to think you're going to be turned into roast pork and eaten with apple sauce,\" for that is what the bear was going to do, you know. So off the two little pig brothers started, and their mamma called after them: \"Now, stay together. Don't go one on one path, and one on another, as you did before, and have trouble. Stay together, and help one another.\" \"We will!\" they answered, and really they meant to, but, you see, little pigs sometimes forget, just as real children do.",

For the old gentleman pig did find two pennies. \"There now, boys,\" he said, \"run along to the candy store. And maybe you can buy a name for yourself,\" and he playfully pulled the ears of Curly's brother. Then Grandpa Squealer sneezed again and walked on, and so did the two boy pigs. \"I'm going to buy a corn lollypop,\" said Curly. \"I think I'll buy a sour-milk one,\" said his brother, for you know little pigs, and big ones, too, like sour milk as much as you like yours sweet. Isn't that funny? So they walked on together, talking of different things, and pretty soon they came to a place where there were two stores. One was painted red and the other was painted blue. \"I'm going in the red store for my lollypop,\" said Curly. \"Oh, let's go in the blue one,\" suggested his brother. \"Maybe I can buy a name for myself in there. I am tired of being called 'Bub' and 'Johnny,' and names like that.",

You couldn't be a soldier with a gun that didn't make any noise.\" \"Then I'm not going to play,\" said Pinky, who was just the color of the inside of a shiny sea shell. \"I'll bounce my rubber ball,\" she went on, \"and you boys can play soldier.\" So she bounced her ball that Grandfather Squealer had given her, while Curly and Floppy as I'll call him for short, made a fort out of cobs from which they had gnawed all the corn, and they had a fine time. They were off playing in the woods, while Pinky stayed near the house. She was hoping her mamma would soon have the apple pie baked and would call her in and give her a piece, when, all of a sudden, as Pinky bounced her ball, it went high in the air, but it didn't come down again right away. \"My! What can have happened?\" thought little Pinky, and she looked around, and there she saw a great big fuzzy fox, standing behind her. And the fox cried out, as he rubbed his nose: \"Did you hit me with that rubber ball?",

So that's all now, but in the next story, in case the oil can doesn't slide down the clothes pole and break the handle off the pump, so the angle worm can't get his ice cream cone, I'll tell you about Curly and the elephant. STORY V CURLY AND THE ELEPHANT When Curly Twistytail, the little pig boy, was digging away with his nose in the front yard, one day, hunting for lollypops, or maybe ice cream cones, under the grass, for all that I know; one day, I say, as he was rooting away, he heard his mamma calling: \"Oh, Curly; Oh, Flop Ear! I want some one to go to the store for me.\" \"That means I've got to go,\" thought Curly, as he looked around to see if his tail was still kinked into a little twist. \"I'll have to go because Flop is off playing ball with Bully the frog. Well, there's no use getting cross about it,\" so, giving a cheerful grunt or two, just to show that he didn't at all mind, Curly ran around to the back door and said: \"What is it, mamma? I'll go to the store for you?",
