He can't tell me what would change if we actually decided to call ourselves boyfriend/girlfriend. He told me yesterday that he'd actually married his first girlfriend. They were together for 6 years from they were 16/17 years old (we are both 29), she got pregnant, they decided to keep it, but she lost it after 3 months, they got married, he felt pushed by her and the 'in laws' to do it. She dictated everything he did. After a year of marriage she cheated on him and after the divorce entered a relationship with same guy. My commitment issues arose from completely different reasons (a one time occurrence of molestation as a kid, and a sexual assault as teenager), and I've moved on.

He can't tell me what would change if we actually decided to call ourselves boyfriend/girlfriend. He told me yesterday that he'd actually married his first girlfriend. They were together for 6 years from they were 16/17 years old (we are both 29), she got pregnant, they decided to keep it, but she lost it after 3 months, they got married, he felt pushed by her and the 'in laws' to do it. She dictated everything he did. After a year of marriage she cheated on him and after the divorce entered a relationship with same guy. My commitment issues arose from completely different reasons (a one time occurrence of molestation as a kid, and a sexual assault as teenager), and I've moved on.

I don't drink, smoke neither tobacco or marijuana, or do any other drugs. Don't party and dance because I like neither and don't feel comfortable and out of place when I went to them. A lot of the feelings of being boring I suppose stem from what a lot of people have told me to my face that I need to experience more, and from seeing what my peers do normally. \\n\\nMost of what I do is loving doing robotics and math and science stuff, which seems to bore people out so incredibly quickly.

So if I gave you all this honest information would you still want to see me again?\\n\\nThanks\\nHow would you deal with it if an older woman told you she had no previous sexual contact before?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;Preference Direction\&quot;: [\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5\n    ],\n    \&quot;comment\&quot;: \&quot;Growing up, I figured that maybe 1% of the women I meet in my life would be interested in dating me.\\n\\nTurns out I guessed wayyyy too high.\\n\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prompt\&quot;: \&quot;Or maybe you realized it really WAS correct.

Masturbation can take like a minute with the right material and mindset so it can be more like blowing your nose.\\n\\nYou could try teasing him more.  Personally, a girl who teases is going to illicit a more intense response than a girl who comes in guns blazing and demanding she be fucked now.  Suggestive commentary, sexy outfits, touching but not being overt about it, all of it can build to some good fun when the guy just cant take any more and has to have you.  You almost have to play a game and get him worked up.  When you take all of that out of sex, it can get old and repetitive because it becomes come in the bedroom, strip down, fuck, go back to what I was doing.  Sex should be fun.

I also throw in cardio/core 1-2 times per week as well.\n* Track calories with MyFitnessPal, currently running a target deficit of 500cals/day.\n* Limiting alcohol intake as much as possible. I do still drink, but stick to mostly sparkling water or club soda as mixer. I pretty much never drink beer.\n* On rest days, I try to walk around and stand up as much as possible (I work at a desk). I sometimes do a yoga flow as well.\n* I avoid \&quot;white\&quot; carbs as much as possible (i.e. white bread, white rice). I don't typically eat these anyway. Same with drinking pop, I don't normally go out of my way to have it.\n* Ensure I'm drinking water or green tea throughout the day.\n\nSince the beginning of June I've dropped about 8lbs (I'm approximately 19% body fat). I'm seeing an ab-line starting to form, but there's still a bit of very stubborn fat that's shrinking but seems to be holding on for dear life.\n\nMy goal isn't really to be competition bodybuilder ripped per se, but maybe get down to about 10-12% body fat and maintain that. I have no plans to stop exercising and eating healthy when I get there. At that point I might try switching to \&quot;maintenance\&quot; calories. The idea is to find a balance between the way I look and feel, while still allowing myself to enjoy myself every now and again.\nMen who have six pack abs, what did you do and how long did it take you to get them?&quot;},&quot;chosen&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Abs are extremely fickle, and not worth the effort IMO unless you have really good Ab genetics.  I have terrible Ab genetics, I have to get much leaner than the average person to get abs.  My roommate however drinks beer every weekend and eats junk food and still has a six pack.\n\nGetting lean is simple; just eat healthy at a slight deficit and work out everyday.  Evaluate your body fat percentage by things other than(but not dis including) your abs.  If your around 15% body fat and you still don’t have a six pack you probably have bad ab genetics.\n\nYou can look good(and even have nice abs) without a six pack.  I have abs, but not a six pack, and girls still think it looks good.\n\nThe one time I did have a six pack was when my boarding school starved me for 2 weeks and I lost 8 pounds and finally had abs, so I guess you can do that.\n&quot;},&quot;rejected&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I'm 43 and have had a 6 pack for most of my life, going back well into my early teenage years. I fell off for a few years in my mid 30s but got them back quickly.\n\nThe first step is to start tracking your calories and determine you TDEE. Then make sure you're eating in a way that aligns with your goals (i.e. below maintenance for losing fat, above for building muscle, etc).\n\nIf you can get your diet on point, the rest is easy. Hanging leg raises, dead bugs, planks, woodchoppers, hanging crunches... there are a million good ab exercises. Find a few that work for you and stick with them at the end of every workout. If you're bracing properly during squats and deadlifts, you'll get some good isometric activation of yours abs there as well. You don't need to do endless cardio, but a couple sessions a week will help. I'll usually mix one session of steady state cardio and one session of HIIT per week into my workout routine (on top of leading an active lifestyle in general).\n\nBut again, none of that will matter if your diet isn't right.

She gave me the go ahead to let her know when ever I was in the city so we could hang out, to which I agreed. Although she is physically plain as paper I have a strange sexual attraction to her, and I say strange because I can be vain and my standards for a woman are farther reaching. I have no romantic notions towards this girl but I do want to sleep with her. She led me to believe that she was more into that idea then me through her manner of coquettish syntax. I feel that if I told her prior to intercourse it would come off arrogantly as I would be assuming that sex is already on the table, and to do after it would just be a cop-out to hitting and quitting which out of respect to her I wouldn't want to do. So the recourse I'm looking for is both *when*, and *how* I should tell her if I meet her this weekend. \\n\\nTL;DR : Wanna bang flirtatious friend I respect, How should I approach telling her I don't want anything more than a FWB relationship w/o being arrogant or disrespectful?\\nWhen is the appropriate time to tell a romantic interest that you have no intention of being more than FWB?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;Preference Direction\&quot;: [\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5\n    ],\n    \&quot;comment\&quot;: \&quot;4 tacos.

Mind you, I have zero sexual experience. My family is very conservative and would never approve of a non-Muslim man since that's forbidden in Islam. If things get pretty serious, it's either the guy converts or I prepare to never see or talk to my family ever again. Also, I have a few controlling brothers and a traditional father. And where I come from, apostasy is punished by death, so coming out of the closet isn't an option really, but that's just the cherry on top . \n\nFor so long, I just accepted the idea of being single, well... forever, because in all honesty, who would ever want to be part of this freak show? But I'm tired of feeling this way. I met a wonderful guy and we hung out for a few months, and when he asked if we could go out on a real date, I explained the above to him, but he apologized and said that was a huge burden for him and it was a fight he couldn't fight. And I respect that. I really do, but it fucking hurts. I'd really like to hear your opinions. Would you ever consider dating someone like me? And if someone asks me out, how do you think I should handle this? How and when do I bring up the family and religion issue? And how would you feel if someone like me made the first move?\n\nMen of Reddit, I need your brutal honesty.\n\ntl;dr It's complicated.\nMen of Reddit, how do you feel about dating ex-Muslim women?&quot;,&quot;rejected&quot;:&quot;If I loved you enough, I would, but you would definitely need to have some sort of plan to get citizenship outside of your home country or a long-term visa so that they could not just show up at your door and force you to go home. Once you get that, I'd buy a gun and you'd tell your family(preferably over the phone)-they'd find out eventually through a private investigator or the like anyway. If any of them try to come over here to force you back against your will afterwards, I'd just sit there on my couch, likely with my friends over, with my weapon on my lap and kindly inform them that while [x crazy religious commandment] might have been the way they did things back in [X-istan], that's not how things work in this society, and that to leave my property and you alone or face legal charges and deportation. I'd likely have to save up my own money and hire a private detective over there to track them so I could know when they are planning to make their initial move as well.\n\nIf they are more reasonable, then we will get along well, though I'd never, ever be comfortable with you returning to a Muslim country if only because they might attempt to pull some Shariah-stuff on us.\n\nAm I paranoid and overreacting? Maybe, but I've seen stories and known a Muslim girl from Saudi Arabia and know just how insane these things can be.\n&quot;},{&quot;Preference Direction&quot;:[0,0.5,1,1,0,1,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5],&quot;chosen&quot;:&quot;Ex wife of 23 years, developed a major substance problem, 17yo son &amp;amp; I havent had contact in over 4 years.

No one is perfect, but the complications associated with the kind of burden we are forced to carry are somewhat nearer to the surface than other, more subtle imperfections can be.

You do have to decide what you want before you can ever start working on a relationship. I decided that having a future, a life and a sense of self was more important than wasting away in misery and depression pretending to be someone I wasn't. And after everything I have been through with my family, I have decided that their brand of conditional love isn't really what I wanted in my life anyway.\\n\\nAs far as when and how to share the situation (once you decide what you really want), it would probably be best for you and for the other person to not lay it all out in one breath, though as others have suggested, I would begin cluing him in early.

My friends here know my story, but my family back home thinks I'm Muslim. I would never want to end up with a Muslim, but at the same time, dating non-Muslim men seems daunting. Mind you, I have zero sexual experience. My family is very conservative and would never approve of a non-Muslim man since that's forbidden in Islam. If things get pretty serious, it's either the guy converts or I prepare to never see or talk to my family ever again. Also, I have a few controlling brothers and a traditional father. And where I come from, apostasy is punished by death, so coming out of the closet isn't an option really, but that's just the cherry on top . \\n\\nFor so long, I just accepted the idea of being single, well... forever, because in all honesty, who would ever want to be part of this freak show? But I'm tired of feeling this way. I met a wonderful guy and we hung out for a few months, and when he asked if we could go out on a real date, I explained the above to him, but he apologized and said that was a huge burden for him and it was a fight he couldn't fight. And I respect that. I really do, but it fucking hurts. I'd really like to hear your opinions. Would you ever consider dating someone like me? And if someone asks me out, how do you think I should handle this? How and when do I bring up the family and religion issue? And how would you feel if someone like me made the first move?\\n\\nMen of Reddit, I need your brutal honesty.\\n\\ntl;dr It's complicated.\\nMen of Reddit, how do you feel about dating ex-Muslim women?\&quot;,\n    \&quot;rejected\&quot;: \&quot;If I loved you enough, I would, but you would definitely need to have some sort of plan to get citizenship outside of your home country or a long-term visa so that they could not just show up at your door and force you to go home. Once you get that, I'd buy a gun and you'd tell your family(preferably over the phone)-they'd find out eventually through a private investigator or the like anyway. If any of them try to come over here to force you back against your will afterwards, I'd just sit there on my couch, likely with my friends over, with my weapon on my lap and kindly inform them that while [x crazy religious commandment] might have been the way they did things back in [X-istan], that's not how things work in this society, and that to leave my property and you alone or face legal charges and deportation. I'd likely have to save up my own money and hire a private detective over there to track them so I could know when they are planning to make their initial move as well.\\n\\nIf they are more reasonable, then we will get along well, though I'd never, ever be comfortable with you returning to a Muslim country if only because they might attempt to pull some Shariah-stuff on us.\\n\\nAm I paranoid and overreacting? Maybe, but I've seen stories and known a Muslim girl from Saudi Arabia and know just how insane these things can be.\\n\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;Preference Direction\&quot;: [\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      1,\n      0,\n      1,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5\n    ],\n    \&quot;chosen\&quot;: \&quot;Ex wife of 23 years, developed a major substance problem, 17yo son &amp;amp; I havent had contact in over 4 years.

Because I realized that I knew exactly what she was talking about. And you do too. Because of their constant fear of rape (conscious or not), women do things throughout the day to protect themselves. Whether it’s carrying our keys in our hands as we walk home, locking our car doors as soon as we get in, or not walking down certain streets, we take precautions. While taking precautions is certainly not a bad idea, the fact that certain things women do are so ingrained into our daily routines is truly disturbing. It’s essentially like living in a prison - all the time. We can’t assume that we’re safe anywhere: not on the streets, not in our homes. And we’re so used to feeling unsafe that we don’t even see that there’s something seriously fucked up about it.”\n-Jessica Valenti, Full Frontal Feminism\nJust saw this post on social media from a female friend...&quot;},{&quot;Preference Direction&quot;:[0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5],&quot;comment&quot;:&quot;A guy from Reddit wrote that his wife asked for divorce after getting one because she didn't get the thrill of a pregnancy anymore.\n&quot;,&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;My family is complete and I believe a vasectomy is better than sterilization for my wife.  \n\n\nWhat do I need to know?  \n\n\n(I'm not looking for horror stories related to the freaky 0.00001% of abnormal cases...

Because I realized that I knew exactly what she was talking about. And you do too. Because of their constant fear of rape (conscious or not), women do things throughout the day to protect themselves. Whether it’s carrying our keys in our hands as we walk home, locking our car doors as soon as we get in, or not walking down certain streets, we take precautions. While taking precautions is certainly not a bad idea, the fact that certain things women do are so ingrained into our daily routines is truly disturbing. It’s essentially like living in a prison - all the time. We can’t assume that we’re safe anywhere: not on the streets, not in our homes. And we’re so used to feeling unsafe that we don’t even see that there’s something seriously fucked up about it.”\\n-Jessica Valenti, Full Frontal Feminism\\nJust saw this post on social media from a female friend...\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;Preference Direction\&quot;: [\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      1,\n      0,\n      1,\n      1,\n      1,\n      1,\n      1,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5,\n      0.5\n    ],\n    \&quot;comment\&quot;: \&quot;A guy from Reddit wrote that his wife asked for divorce after getting one because she didn't get the thrill of a pregnancy anymore.\\n\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prompt\&quot;: \&quot;My family is complete and I believe a vasectomy is better than sterilization for my wife.  \\n\\n\\nWhat do I need to know?  \\n\\n\\n(I'm not looking for horror stories related to the freaky 0.00001% of abnormal cases...

I know I'm not the only one so let's talk about it.  \n\nAs you might be able to tell, my #1 sports team is the Baltimore Ravens.  Actually grew up in cinci, go figure. But moved out to Baltimore at a young age and stared liking football there, so naturally, I'm a Ravens fan.  It's weird, I became a fan in 07. Terrible year. We fired billick.  But then since then, it's been pretty amazing.  I've only really known a good team, except for that first year and this last one.  Next year though, we'll be back. \n\nFuck Pittsburgh  and most of all, fuck Tom Brady.  \n\nBack to my username, you'll see 2423. The 24 is for kobe, the dude who sparked my liking for basketball. Basketball is weird, because I don't really root for one team. For a while I was a Lakers fan, because Baltimore doesn't have a team.  But kobe is leaving now and I don't really feel attached.  I just kinda root for players. I like kobe the most. And when he leaves, I'll probably cry. I like Lebron a lot.  I love steph.  I just kinda root for players.  Also, I root for the Cavs when possible because of coach David Blatt. I'm Israeli, and so is coach Blatt. And he's a pretty huge national pride over here.  I remember when  they signed him, the whole country became Cavs fans.  And then a few weeks later, Lebron came back to Cleveland.  That was huge. \n\nThose are the two sports I follow.  I'm trying to get into another one. Probably hockey.  It seems badass and interesting. I'm just super busy right now and I really don't have time to get invested into another sport.  Eventually I'll do it though.  And after hockey, who knows.  Rugby maybe.  Australian football seems super interesting as well.  Maybe MLS if it takes off.  Not really one for European soccer.  No parity. They need to have a Salary cap there.  It's retarded that two or three teams can just buy success.  Makes watching boring.  Everyone is either a Madrid fan, or a Barcelona fan.  \n\nSo how about you? Unless you're a steelers fan. In which case, go fuck yourself (no jk totally comment.^double ^jk, ^fuck ^you).\nAskmen, let's be stereotypical. What sports teams do you root for? What teams do you hate?&quot;,&quot;rejected&quot;:&quot;LSU, Patriots, and Manchester United because of Eurotrip. \n\nFuck Bama. Fuck Ole Miss. Fuck Arky. Fuck A&amp;amp;M. Fuck Florida.

The kind you see in movies.  If I've got anything in common with those types, it's only my love of sports. Playing them. Watching them. It's just the fucking best.  Idk why. I know I'm not the only one so let's talk about it.  \\n\\nAs you might be able to tell, my #1 sports team is the Baltimore Ravens.  Actually grew up in cinci, go figure. But moved out to Baltimore at a young age and stared liking football there, so naturally, I'm a Ravens fan.  It's weird, I became a fan in 07. Terrible year. We fired billick.  But then since then, it's been pretty amazing.  I've only really known a good team, except for that first year and this last one.  Next year though, we'll be back. \\n\\nFuck Pittsburgh  and most of all, fuck Tom Brady.  \\n\\nBack to my username, you'll see 2423. The 24 is for kobe, the dude who sparked my liking for basketball. Basketball is weird, because I don't really root for one team. For a while I was a Lakers fan, because Baltimore doesn't have a team.  But kobe is leaving now and I don't really feel attached.  I just kinda root for players. I like kobe the most. And when he leaves, I'll probably cry. I like Lebron a lot.  I love steph.  I just kinda root for players.  Also, I root for the Cavs when possible because of coach David Blatt. I'm Israeli, and so is coach Blatt. And he's a pretty huge national pride over here.  I remember when  they signed him, the whole country became Cavs fans.  And then a few weeks later, Lebron came back to Cleveland.  That was huge. \\n\\nThose are the two sports I follow.  I'm trying to get into another one. Probably hockey.  It seems badass and interesting. I'm just super busy right now and I really don't have time to get invested into another sport.  Eventually I'll do it though.  And after hockey, who knows.  Rugby maybe.  Australian football seems super interesting as well.  Maybe MLS if it takes off.  Not really one for European soccer.  No parity. They need to have a Salary cap there.  It's retarded that two or three teams can just buy success.  Makes watching boring.  Everyone is either a Madrid fan, or a Barcelona fan.  \\n\\nSo how about you? Unless you're a steelers fan. In which case, go fuck yourself (no jk totally comment.^double ^jk, ^fuck ^you).\\nAskmen, let's be stereotypical. What sports teams do you root for? What teams do you hate?\&quot;,\n    \&quot;rejected\&quot;: \&quot;LSU, Patriots, and Manchester United because of Eurotrip. \\n\\nFuck Bama. Fuck Ole Miss. Fuck Arky. Fuck A&amp;amp;M.

I've always presented myself as a goofball for a few reasons- it's preferable to demanding to be taken seriously, it's a good way to disarm myself as a 6'1\" bald hairy guy, and humor is a big part of my mom's side of the family.\n\nThese tools have been great to have for me generally, but make things weird when it comes to intimacy. I don't seem to be able to be taken seriously. It makes things like dirty talk and role play difficult. Part of it is I'm sure my own stiffness as I try to get more comfortable in those situations, but I'd like to address things that make me have less sex appeal for my wife.\nHow do you present intimacy and sexuality as a goofball guy?"

I hope this is the right place to ask, if not, tell me and I'll go to r/relationships. \n\nIf you want the back story: As mentioned above, we've been seeing each other for nearly 10 months. Everything about it screams \"actual relationship\" according to my friends (even those who knew him before me). We eat, sleep, have fun together. We're both on tight schedules, so most times we just sleep (actually sleep) together, after eating or watching a film about, 3-4 nights a week. Sex is mostly in the weekends because of work schedules. Trying to keep it short. He says he can't be my boyfriend, that it's difficult, but it's almost as if we're in a relationship. He can't tell me what would change if we actually decided to call ourselves boyfriend/girlfriend. He told me yesterday that he'd actually married his first girlfriend. They were together for 6 years from they were 16/17 years old (we are both 29), she got pregnant, they decided to keep it, but she lost it after 3 months, they got married, he felt pushed by her and the 'in laws' to do it. She dictated everything he did. After a year of marriage she cheated on him and after the divorce entered a relationship with same guy. My commitment issues arose from completely different reasons (a one time occurrence of molestation as a kid, and a sexual assault as teenager), and I've moved on. So I don't know how to help him, or if that's even an option. Even though I love him, I think the only way forward is to break it of, but just the thought of it hurts me.\n\nIf you've got any advice that would be great, but I'd also like to hear about your experiences. Hopefully, they'll be positive ones.\nHow did you (or your SO) get past or deal with commitment issues?",
    "rejected": "Don't pressure him.  Just keep doing what you're doing, because he seems to like it.  \n\nI'm not sure why you think breaking it off is the only way to move forward, unless you are looking for a committed relationship right this second, in which case breaking it off might be a good idea because who knows how long it will take him to be ready.\n"

I guess it mainly stems from the fact that I don't really have the same conventional definition of fun of a lot of people. \n\nIt also stems from the fact that I don't do a lot of shit people my age do. I don't drink, smoke neither tobacco or marijuana, or do any other drugs. Don't party and dance because I like neither and don't feel comfortable and out of place when I went to them. A lot of the feelings of being boring I suppose stem from what a lot of people have told me to my face that I need to experience more, and from seeing what my peers do normally. \n\nMost of what I do is loving doing robotics and math and science stuff, which seems to bore people out so incredibly quickly. I start mentioning robotics and people lose interest. There's sports as well, but even then peers around me have a limited interest. I just wish I didn't feel like I had the personality of a brick sometimes. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? That they're ultimately boring? How do you cope?\nAnyone just feel like they're boring or have no real personality?"

I’m just wondering why men seem to have a tendency to pull back when feeling this way, rather than ask for support\nWhy is it that a majority of men tend to turn inwards and push away when they are feeling bad about themselves?"

If I explained why I was a virgin (ie childhood trauma and abuse) would it make a difference to your decision?\n\nI am in therapy for my issues and trying my best to overcome this and focusing on self improvement.

When you haven't released in a while it's like your brain shuts off and your penis takes over.  Sometimes we just want to shut that fucker up so we can function.  Sex is fun, but it is work.  Masturbation can take like a minute with the right material and mindset so it can be more like blowing your nose.\n\nYou could try teasing him more.  Personally, a girl who teases is going to illicit a more intense response than a girl who comes in guns blazing and demanding she be fucked now.  Suggestive commentary, sexy outfits, touching but not being overt about it, all of it can build to some good fun when the guy just cant take any more and has to have you.  You almost have to play a game and get him worked up.  When you take all of that out of sex, it can get old and repetitive because it becomes come in the bedroom, strip down, fuck, go back to what I was doing.  Sex should be fun.  It shouldn't be a demand I have to meet or have a quota.  Most men may be sexual creatures by nature, but that doesn't mean we don't enjoy a little foreplay or romance.\n",

It hadn't always been like that; in the beginning, we had sex a few times a week, but it dwindled down to a couple of times a month, which was extremely difficult for me, as I felt undesired.\n\nI have been dating my current boyfriend for about 3 months, and while sex with him is great, it's not as frequent as I'd like.  I have communicated to him that if I could, I'd have sex at least once a day (multiple times a day on days off/weekends etc), and that I want a guy who is as into me as I am into him, sexually.\n\nHe actually just told me this morning, \"when it feels like a chore, I don't feel like doing it.\"  \n\nHelp!!  I don't want sex to feel like a chore - I feel like I'm creating the exact environment I want to avoid!  How can I fix this?  What am I doing wrong/what can I do to change my behavior and make it more fun/natural than chore-like?  Has anyone else been in this situation?\nSex as a chore?"

How can anyone stand that? To not leave a single impact on anything in this world always centering your life work until one day you physically can't anymore. How does every person in the world just collectively shrug their shoulders and say \"it is how it is\"??\n\nI realise I'm probably very far from the first person to think this but it's been on my mind for a while and today just amped that thought up to the point where I feel like I'm in a bloody zoo and the worst part is I don't know what I'd rather do instead. I know this sounds egotistical and very ranty but I seriously don't understand how everyone just accepts that not doing whatever is actually worthwhile to them just working everyday for 60 years then dying. And I bet I'll be living like that too very soon.\n\nHow do you all cope??\nHow do people live like this?"

I did this a few times. Am I an asshole for looking at her as someone who I'm competing against and not just as a girl? She's obviously interested (to some extent) in playing frisbee, so why should I change how I play for one specific player.\n\nTo add on to this, it's not like I'm trying to be a douchebag while I'm playing. I cheer everyone on, high five people when they do something well, and joke around with everyone while I'm out there.\n\nThis feels so petty, I just love the sport. What do you guys think?\nCo-ed gym class. Am I an asshole?"

I'm not talking about a 1-hour latency or something, when I don't get a reply I don't press on. I give them space and have to wait 1+ days for a simple \"yes\".\n\nThis whole thing keeps repeating itself. It can't be because they see my photo and think I'm unattractive. I make sure they know my whole physical features before I move onto more personal contacts. Hell, on tinder they see exactly what I look like. It can't be because what I message because my messages are the reason I get their contact info in the first place.\n\nI have about zero experience with women and I'm at my wits end at this point.

Packing for mars and Stiff I can recommend.\n\nThe best thing I have read this years was Liu Cixin's \"the three body problem\".  A scifi book from China which jumped to a place on my all time favourite books.  There are planned sequels which excites me.\n\nI also read The devil in the marshalsea by Antonia Hogson, which is a murder mystery set in a 19th century debtor's prison in London.  That was pretty cool and though you can figure it out quite early, it's still fun.\n\nOh and Lies my teacher told me by James Loewen which can't recommend highly enough.\n\nI do not recommend Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven.  I thought the Ringworld dude could do no wrong but this was fucking awful, even accounting for it's time.  Took me too long to give up.  I thought a comet smashing into earth would make a great book but nah... not always\n"

Here's what I'm already doing:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

* I lift 3x per week. I also throw in cardio/core 1-2 times per week as well.
* Track calories with MyFitnessPal, currently running a target deficit of 500cals/day.
* Limiting alcohol intake as much as possible. I do still drink, but stick to mostly sparkling water or club soda as mixer. I pretty much never drink beer.
* On rest days, I try to walk around and stand up as much as possible (I work at a desk). I sometimes do a yoga flow as well.
* I avoid "white" carbs as much as possible (i.e. white bread, white rice). I don't typically eat these anyway. Same with drinking pop, I don't normally go out of my way to have it.
* Ensure I'm drinking water or green tea throughout the day.

Since the beginning of June I've dropped about 8lbs (I'm approximately 19% body fat). I'm seeing an ab-line starting to form, but there's still a bit of very stubborn fat that's shrinking but seems to be holding on for dear life.

My goal isn't really to be competition bodybuilder ripped per se, but maybe get down to about 10-12% body fat and maintain that. I have no plans to stop exercising and eating healthy when I get there. At that point I might try switching to "maintenance" calories. The idea is to find a balance between the way I look and feel, while still allowing myself to enjoy myself every now and again.
Men who have six pack abs, what did you do and how long did it take you to get them?</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Abs are extremely fickle, and not worth the effort IMO unless you have really good Ab genetics.  I have terrible Ab genetics, I have to get much leaner than the average person to get abs.  My roommate however drinks beer every weekend and eats junk food and still has a six pack.

Getting lean is simple; just eat healthy at a slight deficit and work out everyday.  Evaluate your body fat percentage by things other than(but not dis including) your abs.  If your around 15% body fat and you still don’t have a six pack you probably have bad ab genetics.

You can look good(and even have nice abs) without a six pack.  I have abs, but not a six pack, and girls still think it looks good.

The one time I did have a six pack was when my boarding school starved me for 2 weeks and I lost 8 pounds and finally had abs, so I guess you can do that.
</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">I'm 43 and have had a 6 pack for most of my life, going back well into my early teenage years. I fell off for a few years in my mid 30s but got them back quickly.

The first step is to start tracking your calories and determine you TDEE. Then make sure you're eating in a way that aligns with your goals (i.e. below maintenance for losing fat, above for building muscle, etc).

If you can get your diet on point, the rest is easy. Hanging leg raises, dead bugs, planks, woodchoppers, hanging crunches... there are a million good ab exercises. Find a few that work for you and stick with them at the end of every workout. If you're bracing properly during squats and deadlifts, you'll get some good isometric activation of yours abs there as well. You don't need to do endless cardio, but a couple sessions a week will help. I'll usually mix one session of steady state cardio and one session of HIIT per week into my workout routine (on top of leading an active lifestyle in general).

But again, none of that will matter if your diet isn't right. You'll just have really strong abs beneath a layer of fat.

She gave me the go ahead to let her know when ever I was in the city so we could hang out, to which I agreed. Although she is physically plain as paper I have a strange sexual attraction to her, and I say strange because I can be vain and my standards for a woman are farther reaching. I have no romantic notions towards this girl but I do want to sleep with her. She led me to believe that she was more into that idea then me through her manner of coquettish syntax. I feel that if I told her prior to intercourse it would come off arrogantly as I would be assuming that sex is already on the table, and to do after it would just be a cop-out to hitting and quitting which out of respect to her I wouldn't want to do. So the recourse I'm looking for is both *when*, and *how* I should tell her if I meet her this weekend. \n\nTL;DR : Wanna bang flirtatious friend I respect, How should I approach telling her I don't want anything more than a FWB relationship w/o being arrogant or disrespectful?\nWhen is the appropriate time to tell a romantic interest that you have no intention of being more than FWB?"

In a bar: a guy was out with his friends. Actually he said something to me first, but I approached him outside a bar on a cigarette break. We had a small conversation, he seemed interested, but that was it. Next time I met him his friend said something to me, but that was the end. \n\n\n2. Tinder guy. I had realistic photos, send him photo even without make up, we taled for weeks. Went on a date, but after date he didn't texted back as wuickly as before and used excuse he doesn't have time when I asked for a 'fuck buddy/casual sex'. \n\n\nThere are a lot of these stories. A lot of guys doesn't turn me down instatly, but quick enough. \n\n\n**How can I be better at making first move?** \n\nAnd no I am not that girl \"buy me a drink\", I usually pay my own drink, or buy another round.\nI am a woman who makes a first move, but I haven't been succesfull.

What's weird is that I'm actually pretty good with people; I can strike up a conversation with a stranger pretty easily, and people *seem* to like hanging out with me. Thing is, I just can't seem to get things any further than \"platonic friendship\", and after yet another rejection, it's really getting to me tonight.\n\nThing is, I know that I *must* be doing something wrong, but I don't know exactly *what*. I don't know how to figure out what, either. None of my friends seem to be offering up any feedback, they're all just like \"you just have to be patient\" or \"you're doing fine, just keep being yourself\", but there's clearly something wrong with how I'm presenting myself. It's one thing to go out with someone and just not feel some kind of spark, but another thing entirely to just never even be given a *chance*. And I'm not getting any chances taken on me.\n\nI mean, clearly I should continue losing weight and taking better care of myself, but... I simply can't believe that's the *only* thing. But how do you know? How do you \"troubleshoot\" how to interact with people?\nI've literally never gotten a woman to go out on an actual date before. How can I figure out what I'm doing wrong?",

    "chosen": "*hug* \n\nAs a sister ex-moose with an absolutely amazing never-moose fiancee, I want you to know that it IS possible, even if it isn't easy. No one is perfect, but the complications associated with the kind of burden we are forced to carry are somewhat nearer to the surface than other, more subtle imperfections can be. I was fortunate to end up in a relationship with my best friend, who already knew, understood and long ago accepted the complicated mess that was my life. But then, our relationship was only ever able to happen because he was so wonderfully understanding and willing to accept the convoluted complexities of my life. \n\nHOWEVER, there is a big but here. You do have to decide what you want before you can ever start working on a relationship. I decided that having a future, a life and a sense of self was more important than wasting away in misery and depression pretending to be someone I wasn't. And after everything I have been through with my family, I have decided that their brand of conditional love isn't really what I wanted in my life anyway.\n\nAs far as when and how to share the situation (once you decide what you really want), it would probably be best for you and for the other person to not lay it all out in one breath, though as others have suggested, I would begin cluing him in early. Give him time to realize what he's getting into. The right person for you will be able to deal with it.\n",
    "prompt": "Ex-Muslim studying in Europe here. My friends here know my story, but my family back home thinks I'm Muslim. I would never want to end up with a Muslim, but at the same time, dating non-Muslim men seems daunting. Mind you, I have zero sexual experience. My family is very conservative and would never approve of a non-Muslim man since that's forbidden in Islam. If things get pretty serious, it's either the guy converts or I prepare to never see or talk to my family ever again. Also, I have a few controlling brothers and a traditional father. And where I come from, apostasy is punished by death, so coming out of the closet isn't an option really, but that's just the cherry on top . \n\nFor so long, I just accepted the idea of being single, well... forever, because in all honesty, who would ever want to be part of this freak show? But I'm tired of feeling this way. I met a wonderful guy and we hung out for a few months, and when he asked if we could go out on a real date, I explained the above to him, but he apologized and said that was a huge burden for him and it was a fight he couldn't fight. And I respect that. I really do, but it fucking hurts. I'd really like to hear your opinions. Would you ever consider dating someone like me? And if someone asks me out, how do you think I should handle this? How and when do I bring up the family and religion issue? And how would you feel if someone like me made the first move?\n\nMen of Reddit, I need your brutal honesty.\n\ntl;dr It's complicated.\nMen of Reddit, how do you feel about dating ex-Muslim women?",
    "rejected": "If I loved you enough, I would, but you would definitely need to have some sort of plan to get citizenship outside of your home country or a long-term visa so that they could not just show up at your door and force you to go home. Once you get that, I'd buy a gun and you'd tell your family(preferably over the phone)-they'd find out eventually through a private investigator or the like anyway. If any of them try to come over here to force you back against your will afterwards, I'd just sit there on my couch, likely with my friends over, with my weapon on my lap and kindly inform them that while [x crazy religious commandment] might have been the way they did things back in [X-istan], that's not how things work in this society, and that to leave my property and you alone or face legal charges and deportation. I'd likely have to save up my own money and hire a private detective over there to track them so I could know when they are planning to make their initial move as well.\n\nIf they are more reasonable, then we will get along well, though I'd never, ever be comfortable with you returning to a Muslim country if only because they might attempt to pull some Shariah-stuff on us.\n\nAm I paranoid and overreacting? Maybe, but I've seen stories and known a Muslim girl from Saudi Arabia and know just how insane these things can be.\n"

Thats scary in some ways.\n\n        \n        \nBut that brings something up. Why didn't those male celebrities also get a Prenuptial Agreement?  Had to be a reason that even they didn't do it. They have money for legal advice from the best personal lawers, who would have likely suggested it unless there was a bad side to it that they told them to no do it.      \n        \nthats what I want to know of. Whats the reasons a Man shouldn't get a prenuptial agreement?         \n          \nOr do you think all men should get one? Opinions/Advice appreciated.\nHi Men! Question: is there a reason a Man shouldn't get a Prenuptial Agreement?"

Because I realized that I knew exactly what she was talking about. And you do too. Because of their constant fear of rape (conscious or not), women do things throughout the day to protect themselves. Whether it’s carrying our keys in our hands as we walk home, locking our car doors as soon as we get in, or not walking down certain streets, we take precautions. While taking precautions is certainly not a bad idea, the fact that certain things women do are so ingrained into our daily routines is truly disturbing. It’s essentially like living in a prison - all the time. We can’t assume that we’re safe anywhere: not on the streets, not in our homes. And we’re so used to feeling unsafe that we don’t even see that there’s something seriously fucked up about it.”\n-Jessica Valenti, Full Frontal Feminism\nJust saw this post on social media from a female friend..."

    "prompt": "AKA the shotgun method \n\n\nI hadn't had a date in a while and was in a bit of a rut, so my closest friend introduced me to the shotgun method. He swore by it and said it was the easiest way to getting a date but just took being confident and not afraid of rejection. So it was as easy as going to my university and asking out any girl I found attractive. Here are the results\n\n\nI did about 10 girls a location, as to not get found out. I asked out 53 girls total in the end and received \n\n48 rejections (I have a bf, i'm going somewhere, I can't im sorry) \n\n5 said yes\n\n\nOut of the 5 that said yes, 2 I believe gave me fake phone numbers because they ended up never responding to the texts \n\n\nThe other 3 I texted for a bit but 2 of them flamed out. The 3rd girl we ended up going on 2 dates, still talking to her now\n\n\n\n\n\nSo from my experience this method is ass. Did any of ya'll try this before?\nWhat are your experiences with the \"ask every girl you see out\" method?"

How often do you touch and embrace friends?

It's just the fucking best.  Idk why. I know I'm not the only one so let's talk about it.  \n\nAs you might be able to tell, my #1 sports team is the Baltimore Ravens.  Actually grew up in cinci, go figure. But moved out to Baltimore at a young age and stared liking football there, so naturally, I'm a Ravens fan.  It's weird, I became a fan in 07. Terrible year. We fired billick.  But then since then, it's been pretty amazing.  I've only really known a good team, except for that first year and this last one.  Next year though, we'll be back. \n\nFuck Pittsburgh  and most of all, fuck Tom Brady.  \n\nBack to my username, you'll see 2423. The 24 is for kobe, the dude who sparked my liking for basketball. Basketball is weird, because I don't really root for one team. For a while I was a Lakers fan, because Baltimore doesn't have a team.  But kobe is leaving now and I don't really feel attached.  I just kinda root for players. I like kobe the most. And when he leaves, I'll probably cry. I like Lebron a lot.  I love steph.  I just kinda root for players.  Also, I root for the Cavs when possible because of coach David Blatt. I'm Israeli, and so is coach Blatt. And he's a pretty huge national pride over here.  I remember when  they signed him, the whole country became Cavs fans.  And then a few weeks later, Lebron came back to Cleveland.  That was huge. \n\nThose are the two sports I follow.  I'm trying to get into another one. Probably hockey.  It seems badass and interesting. I'm just super busy right now and I really don't have time to get invested into another sport.  Eventually I'll do it though.  And after hockey, who knows.  Rugby maybe.  Australian football seems super interesting as well.  Maybe MLS if it takes off.  Not really one for European soccer.  No parity. They need to have a Salary cap there.  It's retarded that two or three teams can just buy success.  Makes watching boring.  Everyone is either a Madrid fan, or a Barcelona fan.  \n\nSo how about you? Unless you're a steelers fan. In which case, go fuck yourself (no jk totally comment.^double ^jk, ^fuck ^you).\nAskmen, let's be stereotypical. What sports teams do you root for? What teams do you hate?",
    "rejected": "LSU, Patriots, and Manchester United because of Eurotrip. \n\nFuck Bama. Fuck Ole Miss. Fuck Arky. Fuck A&amp;amp;M. Fuck Florida. Fuck Miss St. And fuck the Jets.\n"
