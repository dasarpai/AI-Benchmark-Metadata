For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\tBlood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\n\t\t\t\t\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\n\t\t\t\t\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20023109&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;Asking for help is usually interpreted as asking about treatments, but in this case, answers about confirming the diagnosis are also relevant.&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ14A1&quot;},{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be\n\t\t\t\t\treduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years.

In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBlood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlaboratory.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20023109\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;Asking for help is usually interpreted as asking about treatments, but in this case, answers about confirming the diagnosis are also relevant.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ14A1\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tActemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Giant-Cell-Arteritis\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ14A2\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;QUESTION_ID&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TQ14&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_SUBJECT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vasculitis&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_MESSAGE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis\n\t\t\t\tOur doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help\n\t\t\t\tFrom you .

Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgene is needed in order to inherit the disease.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited.

Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpresenilin-2 (PS-2).\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_causes_risk_factors.asp\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;The answer is for Alzheimers, but not the broader term dementia.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ27A1\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgene is needed in order to inherit the disease.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited.

Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',\n\t\t\t\tand I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree\n\t\t\t\tclimber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones?

Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:\n\t\t\t\t\tRed, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.\n\t\t\t\t\tPatches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.\n\t\t\t\t\tAbnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000876.htm&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ56A1&quot;},{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the\n\t\t\t\t\tskin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your\n\t\t\t\t\tgroin, between your genitals and thighs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOther fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Chafing\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That\n\t\t\t\t\tmoisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says\n\t\t\t\t\tDr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll\n\t\t\t\t\tusually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Herpes\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the\n\t\t\t\t\tblisters can break, leading to painful sores.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than\n\t\t\t\t\tsome itching, the warts don't feel like anything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOr, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/02/01/7-reasons-your-groin-is-so-itchy.html&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;Alternative causes of itching and bumps in scrotal area are relevant&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ56A2&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis.

However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried\n\t\t\t\t\tusing the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults\n\t\t\t\t\tusually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/scabies/prevent.html&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;Prevention&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ65A1&quot;},{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No \&quot;over-the-counter\&quot; (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat\n\t\t\t\t\tscabies.\n\t\t\t\t\tScabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who\n\t\t\t\t\thave had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/scabies/treatment.html&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;Treatment&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ65A2&quot;},{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif new burrows and rash appear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedications commonly prescribed for scabies include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPermethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.\n\t\t\t\t\tLindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or\n\t\t\t\t\tanyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).\n\t\t\t\t\tCrotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.\n\t\t\t\t\tIvermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who\n\t\t\t\t\tweigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDoctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scabies/basics/treatment/con-20023488&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;treatment&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ65A3&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested.

All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thousehold members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tusing the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tusually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/scabies/prevent.html\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;Prevention\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ65A1\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No \\\&quot;over-the-counter\\\&quot; (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tscabies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tScabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twell as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/scabies/treatment.html\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;Treatment\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ65A2\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif new burrows and rash appear.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMedications commonly prescribed for scabies include:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPermethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIvermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tweigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDoctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scabies/basics/treatment/con-20023488\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;treatment\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ65A3\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;QUESTION_ID&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TQ65&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_SUBJECT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mite Infestation&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_MESSAGE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_FILE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1-132152455.xml.txt&quot;},&quot;ANNOTATIONS_FOCUS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;_fid&quot;:&quot;F1&quot;,&quot;_fcategory&quot;:&quot;Problem&quot;,&quot;__text&quot;:&quot;mite infestation&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;_fid\&quot;: \&quot;F1\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_fcategory\&quot;: \&quot;Problem\&quot;,\n    \&quot;__text\&quot;: \&quot;mite infestation\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;ANNOTATIONS_TYPE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;_tid&quot;:&quot;T1&quot;,&quot;_hasFocus&quot;:&quot;F1&quot;,&quot;__text&quot;:&quot;TREATMENT&quot;,&quot;_hasKeyword&quot;:null},{&quot;_tid&quot;:&quot;T2&quot;,&quot;_hasFocus&quot;:&quot;F1&quot;,&quot;__text&quot;:&quot;PREVENTION&quot;,&quot;_hasKeyword&quot;:null}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;_tid\&quot;: \&quot;T1\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_hasFocus\&quot;: \&quot;F1\&quot;,\n    \&quot;__text\&quot;: \&quot;TREATMENT\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_hasKeyword\&quot;: null\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;_tid\&quot;: \&quot;T2\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_hasFocus\&quot;: \&quot;F1\&quot;,\n    \&quot;__text\&quot;: \&quot;PREVENTION\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_hasKeyword\&quot;: null\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;ANNOTATIONS_KEYWORD&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[null],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  null\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:65,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;NIST_PARAPHRASE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it safe to take medications with wine at dinnertime?&quot;},&quot;NLM_SUMMARY&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Is it safe to take medications with wine at dinnertime?&quot;},&quot;REFERENCE_ANSWERS&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful.

When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females\n\t\t\t\t\t(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\n\t\t\t\t\tLess commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each\n\t\t\t\t\tcell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than\n\t\t\t\t\tfemales.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of\n\t\t\t\t\ta gene in each cell have mutations.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets#inheritance&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ75A1&quot;},{&quot;ANSWER&quot;:&quot;Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene\n\t\t\t\t\t(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a father has the mutated X-linked gene:\n\t\t\t\t\tall of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)\n\t\t\t\t\tnone of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLess commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner.&quot;,&quot;AnswerURL&quot;:&quot;https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6735/hypophosphatemic-rickets&quot;,&quot;COMMENT&quot;:&quot;Answers describing inheritance are relevant&quot;,&quot;_aid&quot;:&quot;TQ75A2&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance.

In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLess commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfemales.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta gene in each cell have mutations.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets#inheritance\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ75A1\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;ANSWER\&quot;: \&quot;Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf a father has the mutated X-linked gene:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tall of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnone of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLess commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;AnswerURL\&quot;: \&quot;https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6735/hypophosphatemic-rickets\&quot;,\n    \&quot;COMMENT\&quot;: \&quot;Answers describing inheritance are relevant\&quot;,\n    \&quot;_aid\&quot;: \&quot;TQ75A2\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;},&quot;QUESTION_ID&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;TQ75&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_SUBJECT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Inherited Ricketts&quot;},&quot;ORIGINAL_QUESTION_MESSAGE&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Mother has inherited ricketts.

  {
    "ANSWER": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and\n\t\t\t\t\tBonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a\n\t\t\t\t\tshield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of\n\t\t\t\t\trotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.",

    "COMMENT": "This article is from 1976, and is a case report.",

  {
    "ANSWER": "10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.",
    "AnswerURL": "http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61023-X/fulltext",
    "COMMENT": "Often, the questions are about the associations that do not exist, as is in this case: there is one patient with both disorders. Answers about the lack of association or one of the conditions and more general disorders (as renal disease in this case) are relevant.",
    "_aid": "TQ1A2"
  },
  {
    "ANSWER": "Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal\n\t\t\t\t\tectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly.",

This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.\n\t\t\t\t\tFollow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.\n\t\t\t\t\tAll sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

    "ANSWER": "Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the\n\t\t\t\t\tveins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will\n\t\t\t\t\tdevelop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.",

    "ANSWER": "Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.",

    "ANSWER": "A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly\n\t\t\t\t\tafter fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.",

    "ANSWER": "Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\tBlood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\n\t\t\t\t\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\n\t\t\t\t\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.",

  {
    "ANSWER": "GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be\n\t\t\t\t\treduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tActemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis.",

For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system\n\t\t\t\t\tapplied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara system, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to\n\t\t\t\t\ttaper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3- to 6-month intervals.",

    "ANSWER": "Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due\n\t\t\t\t\tto changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.\n\t\t\t\t\tSymptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.\n\t\t\t\t\tTo fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.\n\t\t\t\t\tChildren with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).\n\t\t\t\t\tSome children respond well to treatment, while others do not.",

  {
    "ANSWER": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow\n\t\t\t\t\tby about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as\n\t\t\t\t\themihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as\n\t\t\t\t\ta soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include\n\t\t\t\t\tabnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.\n\t\t\t\t\tChildren with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition\n\t\t\t\t\tand almost always appear in childhood.\n\t\t\t\t\tMost children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.",

    "ANSWER": "The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and\n\t\t\t\t\tphysical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI.",

    "ANSWER": "Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and\n\t\t\t\t\tpresenilin-2 (PS-2).",

    "ANSWER": "The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgene is needed in order to inherit the disease.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease\n\t\t\t\t\tare not inherited.",

Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying\n\t\t\t\t\tpathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and\n\t\t\t\t\tmedications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered.",

    "ANSWER": "Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue\n\t\t\t\t\tby mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUlcerative colitis Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as:\n\t\t\t\t\tAIDS; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; Herpes zoster infection; Histoplasmosis; Kawasaki disease; Syphilis; Toxoplasmosis; Tuberculosis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis.

    "ANSWER": "If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSevere fatigue\n\t\t\t\t\tWeakness\n\t\t\t\t\tBody aches\n\t\t\t\t\tJoint pain\n\t\t\t\t\tPrednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are\n\t\t\t\t\ttapering off the drug",

    "ANSWER": "If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your\n\t\t\t\t\tbody may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual\n\t\t\t\t\tsymptoms while you are taking decreasing doses of prednisone or after you stop taking the medication.",

    "ANSWER": "Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSymptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour symptoms may include:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Wheezing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Tight chest\n\t\t\t\t\t* Cough\n\t\t\t\t\t* Shortness of breath\n\t\t\t\t\t* Chest pain (rarely)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTriggers\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through\n\t\t\t\t\tyour nose, triggering asthma symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAir pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These\n\t\t\t\t\tinclude:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Hiking\n\t\t\t\t\t* Baseball\n\t\t\t\t\t* Golf\n\t\t\t\t\t* Walking\n\t\t\t\t\t* Leisure biking\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Cross-country skiing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Running\n\t\t\t\t\t* Soccer\n\t\t\t\t\t* Basketball\n\t\t\t\t\t* Hockey",

In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...\n\t\t\t\t\tOne recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...\n\t\t\t\t\tOne study found that people who practiced Hatha yoga two-and-a-half hours a week for 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. The same benefit would probably result from Tai Chi, a martial art that also emphasizes breathing, says Dr. Graham. ...",

				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.</span></div></div>

  {
    "ANSWER": "Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers\n\t\t\t\t\t(ventricles) of your heart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFor those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)",

When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.\n\t\t\t\t\tPersistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as \"left atrial\n\t\t\t\t\tflutter.\" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately\n\t\t\t\t\t75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.",

    "ANSWER": "The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the\n\t\t\t\t\ttreatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose\n\t\t\t\t\tnaltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.",

    "ANSWER": "Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further\n\t\t\t\t\tHAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated\n\t\t\t\t\tblood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\tHEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.",

    "ANSWER": "Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the\n\t\t\t\t\tskin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your\n\t\t\t\t\tgroin, between your genitals and thighs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOther fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Chafing\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That\n\t\t\t\t\tmoisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says\n\t\t\t\t\tDr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll\n\t\t\t\t\tusually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Herpes\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the\n\t\t\t\t\tblisters can break, leading to painful sores.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than\n\t\t\t\t\tsome itching, the warts don't feel like anything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOr, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com.",

    "ANSWER": "Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially in overdosage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but\n\t\t\t\t\tno increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.\n\t\t\t\t\tMore research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe evidence is current to October 2014.",

				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct "dosage"? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.</span></div></div>

    "ANSWER": "When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried\n\t\t\t\t\tusing the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults\n\t\t\t\t\tusually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.",

    "ANSWER": "Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No \"over-the-counter\" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat\n\t\t\t\t\tscabies.\n\t\t\t\t\tScabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who\n\t\t\t\t\thave had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.",

    "ANSWER": "Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif new burrows and rash appear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedications commonly prescribed for scabies include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPermethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.\n\t\t\t\t\tLindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or\n\t\t\t\t\tanyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).\n\t\t\t\t\tCrotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.\n\t\t\t\t\tIvermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who\n\t\t\t\t\tweigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDoctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications.",

    "ANSWER": "Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can\n\t\t\t\t\tmake it dangerous to drive, and when you mix alcohol with certain medicines you put yourself at even greater risk. Combining alcohol with some medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries, especially among older people.",

    "ANSWER": "What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAn x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis.",

Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.\n\t\t\t\t\tOther medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.\n\t\t\t\t\tSurgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOrthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.\n\t\t\t\t\tAn orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.\n\t\t\t\t\tAn orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.\n\t\t\t\t\tOther surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.\n\t\t\t\t\tA surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.\n\t\t\t\t\tA surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.\n\t\t\t\t\tSclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.\n\t\t\t\t\tLaser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain).

  {
    "ANSWER": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females\n\t\t\t\t\t(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\n\t\t\t\t\tLess commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each\n\t\t\t\t\tcell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than\n\t\t\t\t\tfemales.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of\n\t\t\t\t\ta gene in each cell have mutations.",

  {
    "ANSWER": "Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene\n\t\t\t\t\t(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a father has the mutated X-linked gene:\n\t\t\t\t\tall of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)\n\t\t\t\t\tnone of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLess commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner.",

<p>The dataset provides 634 question-answer pairs for training: </p>
<pre><code>1) TREC-2017-LiveQA-Medical-Train-1.xml =&gt; 388 question-answer pairs corresponding to 200 NLM questions. 
Each question is divided into one or more subquestion(s). Each subquestion has one or more answer(s). 
These question-answer pairs were constructed automatically and validated manually. 

2) TREC-2017-LiveQA-Medical-Train-2.xml =&gt; 246 question-answer pairs corresponding to 246 NLM questions.
Answers were retrieved manually by librarians.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>You can access them as jsonl</strong></p>
<p>The datasets are not exhaustive with regards to subquestions, i.e., some subquestions might not be annotated. 
Additional annotations are provided for both (i) the Focus and (ii) the Question Type used to define each subquestion.
