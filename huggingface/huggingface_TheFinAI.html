2017?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.18004&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's dive into this question about amortization expenses. First, I need to identify the table that illustrates the estimated amortization expenses from 2017 onwards. It looks like this table is super important in figuring out the expense for 2017. \n\nOkay, found it! The table clearly states that the estimated amortization expense for the year 2017 is $10,509, but it notes that this is in thousands. \n\nLet me think for a second. If the numbers are in thousands, that means I need to convert that $10,509 into actual dollars, which becomes $10,509,000. Easy enough, I just multiply by a thousand. \n\nI need to make sure this is consistent throughout. Let me double-check if there's any other information that throws a wrench in this conversion... Nope, everything seems straightforward here. \n\nSo, what's the conclusion? The amortization expense for 2017 is a clear-cut $10,509,000. Hmm, that makes sense based on the conversion from thousands of dollars, and it looks like there aren't any surprise twists or exceptions here. \n\nBut hold up, let me consider the perspective of portions. The context refers to percentages or parts, and for that, I should be thinking about the total amortization expense. The whole amount listed is $58,370,000 for all the intangible assets. \n\nTo find out what part of the total this 2017 expense represents, I'll calculate a ratio. So, I divide $10,509,000 by the grand total, $58,370,000. Crunching these numbers gives me around 0.18004.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the portion of the total estimated amortization expense that is specifically for 2017 is approximately 0.18004 of the total. I'm confident that's correct since that ratio aligns perfectly with the expectation of finding a portion or part. \n\nPhew, that should do it!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To determine the portion of the estimated amortization expense that will be recognized in 2017, we first examine the table provided. The estimated amortization expense for 2017 is $10,509,000 (noting that the figures are in thousands, hence $10,509 becomes $10,509,000). \n\nThe total estimated amortization expense for all the listed years is $58,370,000. To find out what portion of the total this represents for 2017, we take the 2017 expense and divide it by the total:\n\n\\[ \\text{Portion for 2017} = \\frac{\\text{2017 expense}}{\\text{Total expense}} = \\frac{10,509,000}{58,370,000} \\approx 0.18004 \\]\n\nTherefore, approximately 18.004% of the total estimated amortization expense will be recognized in 2017.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: the following table discloses purchases of shares of valero 2019s common stock made by us or on our behalf during the fourth quarter of period total number of shares purchased average price paid per share total number of shares not purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs ( a ) total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs ( b ) .\n|period|total numberof sharespurchased|averageprice paidper share|total number ofshares notpurchased as part ofpublicly announcedplans or programs ( a )|total number ofshares purchased aspart of publiclyannounced plans orprograms|approximate dollarvalue of shares thatmay yet be purchasedunder the plans orprograms ( b )|\n|october 2014|3180678|$ 46.27|302005|2878673|$ 1.8 billion|\n|november 2014|2001273|$ 50.32|119047|1882226|$ 1.7 billion|\n|december 2014|5120398|$ 48.56|2624|5117774|$ 1.5 billion|\n|total|10302349|$ 48.20|423676|9878673|$ 1.5 billion|\n( a ) the shares reported in this column represent purchases settled in the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to ( i ) our purchases of shares in open-market transactions to meet our obligations under stock-based compensation plans , and ( ii ) our purchases of shares from our employees and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options , the vesting of restricted stock , and other stock compensation transactions in accordance with the terms of our stock-based compensation plans .

In December, the number of shares purchased as part of those plans was quite a bit higher, at 5,117,774.\nI need to figure out how many more shares were purchased in December compared to October. To do that, I'll just subtract the October shares from the December shares.\nSo, it's 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673. Let me calculate that real quick.\nAh, the result comes out to be 2,239,101. This is how many more shares were purchased in December than in October.\nJust to be sure, I'll double-check this. Yep, doing the subtraction again confirms it: 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673 is definitely 2,239,101.\nAlright, so in conclusion, compared to October 2014, there were 2,239,101 more shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans in December 2014.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Compared to October 2014, 2,239,101 more shares were purchased as part of publicly announced plans in December 2014.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: note 9 2014 benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the united states and certain international locations . postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits provided to qualifying domestic retirees as well as other postretirement benefit plans in international countries are not material . the measurement date used for the company 2019s employee benefit plans is september 30 . effective january 1 , 2018 , the legacy u.s . pension plan was frozen to limit the participation of employees who are hired or re-hired by the company , or who transfer employment to the company , on or after january 1 , net pension cost for the years ended september 30 included the following components: .\n|( millions of dollars )|pension plans 2019|pension plans 2018|pension plans 2017|\n|service cost|$ 134|$ 136|$ 110|\n|interest cost|107|90|61|\n|expected return on plan assets|( 180 )|( 154 )|( 112 )|\n|amortization of prior service credit|( 13 )|( 13 )|( 14 )|\n|amortization of loss|78|78|92|\n|settlements|10|2|2014|\n|net pension cost|$ 135|$ 137|$ 138|\n|net pension cost included in the preceding table that is attributable to international plans|$ 32|$ 34|$ 43|\nnet pension cost included in the preceding table that is attributable to international plans $ 32 $ 34 $ 43 the amounts provided above for amortization of prior service credit and amortization of loss represent the reclassifications of prior service credits and net actuarial losses that were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) in prior periods . the settlement losses recorded in 2019 and 2018 primarily included lump sum benefit payments associated with the company 2019s u.s . supplemental pension plan . the company recognizes pension settlements when payments from the supplemental plan exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost associated with this plan for the fiscal year . as further discussed in note 2 , upon adopting an accounting standard update on october 1 , 2018 , all components of the company 2019s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs , aside from service cost , are recorded to other income ( expense ) , net on its consolidated statements of income , for all periods presented . notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) becton , dickinson and company .\nQuestion: what is the percentage increase in service costs from 2017 to 2018?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.23636&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's sort through these numbers and figure out the change in service costs from 2017 to 2018.\n\nFirst, we have to find the service cost for both years. Hmm, for 2017, it looks like the service cost is $110 million. For 2018, it's listed as $136 million.\n\nNow let's see how much that went up. We need to get the difference between these two figures. So, if I subtract 2017's $110 million from 2018's $136 million, I get $26 million. That's the increase in service costs over the year.\n\nNext, let's turn that increase into a percentage so we can better understand the scale of it. We want to compare the $26 million increase to the 2017 amount, $110 million, as a base. To do this, we'll divide the increase, $26 million, by the 2017 cost, $110 million.\n\nWhen we divide $26 million by $110 million, we end up with about 0.2364. Multiplying by 100 turns this into a percentage. So, $26 million is approximately 23.64% of $110 million.\n\nOh, so after running the numbers, it turns out that from 2017 to 2018, the service costs went up by roughly 23.64%. Yeah, that makes sense given the data at hand.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The percentage increase in service costs from 2017 to 2018 is approximately 23.64%.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: analog devices , inc . notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) the following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under long-term operating leases at october 31 , operating fiscal years leases .\n|fiscal years|operating leases|\n|2016|$ 21780|\n|2017|16305|\n|2018|8670|\n|2019|4172|\n|2020|3298|\n|later years|5263|\n|total|$ 59488|\n12 . commitments and contingencies from time to time , in the ordinary course of the company 2019s business , various claims , charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the company arising from , or related to , contractual matters , patents , trademarks , personal injury , environmental matters , product liability , insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes . as to such claims and litigation , the company can give no assurance that it will prevail . the company does not believe that any current legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the company 2019s financial position , results of operations or cash flows . 13 . retirement plans the company and its subsidiaries have various savings and retirement plans covering substantially all employees . the company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of its eligible u.s . employees . this plan provides for company contributions of up to 5% ( 5 % ) of each participant 2019s total eligible compensation . in addition , the company contributes an amount equal to each participant 2019s pre-tax contribution , if any , up to a maximum of 3% ( 3 % ) of each participant 2019s total eligible compensation . the total expense related to the defined contribution plan for u.s . employees was $ 26.3 million in fiscal 2015 , $ 24.1 million in fiscal 2014 and $ 23.1 million in fiscal 2013 . the company also has various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain non-u.s . employees that are consistent with local statutory requirements and practices . the total expense related to the various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain non-u.s . employees , excluding settlement charges related to the company's irish defined benefit plan , was $ 33.3 million in fiscal 2015 , $ 29.8 million in fiscal 2014 and $ 26.5 million in fiscal 2013 . non-u.s . plan disclosures during fiscal 2015 , the company converted the benefits provided to participants in the company 2019s irish defined benefits pension plan ( the db plan ) to benefits provided under the company 2019s irish defined contribution plan . as a result , in fiscal 2015 the company recorded expenses of $ 223.7 million , including settlement charges , legal , accounting and other professional fees to settle the pension obligation . the assets related to the db plan were liquidated and used to purchase annuities for retirees and distributed to active and deferred members' accounts in the company's irish defined contribution plan in connection with the plan conversion . accordingly , plan assets for the db plan were zero as of the end of fiscal 2015 . the company 2019s funding policy for its foreign defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country . the plans 2019 assets consist primarily of u.s . and non-u.s . equity securities , bonds , property and cash . the benefit obligations and related assets under these plans have been measured at october 31 , 2015 and november 1 , 2014 . components of net periodic benefit cost net annual periodic pension cost of non-u.s . plans is presented in the following table: .\nQuestion: what percent of the leases was paid off in 2016?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.36612&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's figure out what percentage of the total lease payments was taken care of in 2016. First, I'm noticing from the data that the total future minimum rental payments under long-term operating leases add up to $59,488. That's quite a sum in total. Now, focusing specifically on the payments for 2016, it seems that amount is $21,780. So, what I need to do is find out what portion of the total $59,488 was paid in 2016. \n\nTo do this, I think it's just a matter of dividing the 2016 payments by the total and then converting that fraction into a percentage. So, let's go ahead and calculate: $21,780 divided by $59,488 gives a decimal. Multiplying that decimal by 100 will convert it into a percentage. \n\nOkay, let me do the math: (21,780 / 59,488) * 100 = about 36.61. So, there you have it, roughly 36.61% of the lease commitments were paid off in 2016. \n\nHuh, interesting. That seems like a significant chunk of the lease commitments right there paid in one year. To double-check, I quickly run through the calculations again to make sure everything adds upâ€”and yes, the numbers confirm it.

According to the data, Europe has 4928 wholesale doors as of March 31, 2018.

A quick look at the table shows a total of 12226 doors across all segments, not just Europe. Excellent, now I have the total I need.\n\nWith these numbers, I need to calculate what percentage of the total 12226 doors belong to Europe. I just have to divide the European doors, that's 4928, by the total doors, 12226, and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nLet's do the math: 4928 divided by 12226, then times 100.

Now I've got both crucial numbers: $1679.7 million and $945.6 million.\n\nNow that we have the numbers, we need to set up the ratio. This means we are comparing $1679.7 million to $945.6 million. So, we'll take the amount of operating cash, $1679.7 million, and divide it by the purchases, which was $945.6 million.\n\nPerforming that division should give us our answer. Let's see, doing the math â€” we divide 1679.7 by 945.6. Okay, and that comes out to around 1.776.\n\nSo there we have it.

First off, I see that in 2012, the net revenue was $4969 million, and in 2013 it was $5524 million.\n\nHmm, to figure out the actual change in net revenue, I'll just subtract the 2012 amount from the 2013 amount. So, $5524 million minus $4969 million, and that gives us a change of $555 million. \n\nNow, I'm noticing there's a mention of volume/weather contributing to this change in net revenue. The amount attributed to volume/weather is $40 million. \n\nTo find out how much of the total change this volume/weather accounts for percentage-wise, Iâ€™m going to calculate what share $40 million is of the $555 million. So, let's just do $40 million divided by $555 million. \n\nOkay, now that I've got that, let's multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage. This works out to around 7.21%. \n\nSo, it looks like about 7.21% of the change in net revenue from 2012 to 2013 was due to volume/weather. That lines up nicely with whatâ€™s been calculated, and everything seems to check out well.

First, I've got the numbers right here. Net earnings for 2016 are $14,239 million and for 2017, they are $10,222 million.  \n\nOkay, so next, I need to figure out the change in net earnings. I mean, how much did it go up or down by? It's $10,222 million minus $14,239 million, right? So let's do that math. Hmm, that's a change of -$4,017 million. Looks like earnings went down.\n\nNow to get the percent change, there's a formula we use: (Change in Value / Original Value) * 100. The original value must be the amount from 2016, which is $14,239 million.\n\nI need to plug these numbers into the formula, so it's (-$4,017 million / $14,239 million) * 100. Let me do that division first. Wow, it's around -0.2821.\n\nOkay, multiplying by 100 gives me a percentage. Hmm, that's about -28.21%. So, Altria's net earnings actually decreased by roughly 28.21% from 2016 to 2017.\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check everything to be sure. Let's go over the key steps again. The net earnings in 2016 are $14,239 million, and in 2017 they're $10,222 million. Re-doing the math for change, it's -$4,017 million. Dividing this by $14,239 million and then multiplying by 100 does indeed give about, ah yes, -28.21%.\n\nIt's settled then, the percent change in those net earnings from 2016 to 2017 is a decrease of about 28.21%.

I remember the formula: itâ€™s the difference between the final value and the initial value, divided by the initial value, all multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. \n\nAlright, let's plug those numbers into the formula. So, it would be ((369 - 100) / 100) * 100. \n\nLetâ€™s do the math here: subtracting gives 269, and then dividing by 100 gives 2.69. Multiplying by 100 means the percentage return is 269%. \n\nI should double-check this since it seems pretty large, but the calculation looks correct given the growth from $100 to $369. \n\nYeah, I'm sure of it now.

That includes $42.2 million paid in common stock, a cash payment of $1.6 million to some shareholders, and another $1.3 million spent on transaction costs.\n\nNow, let's not forget about those contingent payments. Theyâ€™re based on hitting certain milestones, like FDA approvals. If every milestone is reached, the additional cost could go up to $11.2 million. But oh, wait, I see they already achieved one of those milestones. It was for the 510(k) clearance, and it triggered a $5.6 million payment.\n\nSo, what happens if they meet all the milestones? Well, they'd need to pay the full $11.2 million in contingent payments. Let me add that to the initial $45.1 million purchase price. Doing the math, it's $45.1 million plus $11.2 million.\n\nHmm, the total potential cost assuming every single milestone is hit should be $56.3 million. That makes sense because we're just adding the maximum possible contingent payment to the original price.\n\nDouble-checking everything, initially paid was $45.1 million, and with all contingencies, the total could be $56.3 million.

Scanning down the list, I notice Animal Planet is right behind Discovery Channel with 166 million subscribers.\n\nNow, letâ€™s figure out the difference in subscribers between these two big networks. If I subtract Animal Planetâ€™s subscribers from Discovery Channel's total, I get 213 million minus 166 million. That works out to 47 million more subscribers for Discovery Channel.\n\nSo, Discovery Channel is larger by 47 million subscribers than Animal Planet. But what I'm really trying to determine is how much larger in percentage terms. To do this, Iâ€™ll take the difference in the number of subscribers, the 47 million, and divide it by the number of subscribers that the second largest network, Animal Planet, has. Now, Iâ€™ll multiply that result by 100 to make it a percentage. Letâ€™s crunch these numbers: 47 divided by 166, and then multiplied by 100 gives me roughly 28.31%.\n\nOkay, so Discovery Channel has about 28.31% more subscribers than Animal Planet.

We've invested $100 in three different options on November 17, 2011: Delphi Automotive PLC, the S&amp;P 500, and the Automotive Supplier Peer Group. Now, we're interested in figuring out which one had the lowest return by the end of December 31, 2011.\n\nFirst, letâ€™s take a look at Delphi Automotive PLC. The initial investment was $100, and by December 31, 2011, itâ€™s worth $100.98. Thatâ€™s almost $1 more than what we started with. To get the percentage return, I'll do a quick calculation: (100.98 - 100) / 100 * 100. So, ah, that gives us about a 0.98% return.\n\nNext up is the S&amp;P 500. Started at $100 and by the same date, itâ€™s worth $100.80. Looks like it increased by 80 cents. Using a similar calculation as before: (100.80 - 100) / 100 * 100 gives a 0.80% return.\n\nNow for the Automotive Supplier Peer Group, initially, we have $100 which turns into $89.27 by December end. Thatâ€™s a drop, right? Letâ€™s see how much: (89.27 - 100) / 100 * 100, and thatâ€™s a decrease of about 10.73%. Wow, a negative return.\n\nIâ€™m thinking the Automotive Supplier Peer Group had the lowest return because itâ€™s the only one that actually lost money.\n\nLet me double check the calculations. Delphi and the S&amp;P 500 both had positive gains, but the Supplier Group actually lost $10.73, yep. So the question asked about the lowest return, and clearly, thatâ€™s a negative return from the Automotive Supplier Peer Group at -10.73%. That makes sense given the data we have.\n\nYes, the calculation seems accurate, and it aligns with the data. The lowest return in the first year of investment is definitely from the Automotive Supplier Peer Group with that negative rate. Sometimes numbers just donâ€™t lie!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The lowest return for the first year of the investment, ending on December 31, 2011, was from the Automotive Supplier Peer Group, which saw a decrease of approximately 10.73%, turning a $100 investment into $89.27.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:13,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: the following tables present a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) for 2017 and 2016 , respectively: .\n||level 3|\n|balance as of january 1 2017|$ 140|\n|actual return on assets|2|\n|purchases issuances and settlements net|136|\n|balance as of december 31 2017|$ 278|\npurchases , issuances and settlements , net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It looks like we're supposed to calculate the percentage of the return on assets compared to the ending balance for 2017. Hmm, to do that, we'll need two pieces of information: first, the actual return on assets, and then, the balance at the end of December 2017.\n\nAlright, checking the data provided, the return on assets is given as $2. Got it. Now, let's find the ending balance for December 31, 2017. Oh, there it isâ€”it's $278.\n\nNow that we have both figures, we can work on calculating the percentage. It's simply about dividing the return on assets by the ending balance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nOkay, let's do the math. When we divide 2 by 278, what do we get? Hmm, it looks like approximately 0.00719. To convert that into a percentage, we just multiply it by 100, which gives us 0.719%. Interesting, right?\n\nSo, in 2017, the percent of the return on assets relative to the ending balance is about 0.719%. I think that's right. But let's just double-check to make sure we've got the right interpretation and calculations.\n\nLet's see, we verified that the return on assets is $2, and the ending balance is indeed $278. Nothing seems off there. The calculations seem consistent as well. Looks like everything checks out.\n\nAlright, so the final takeaway is that the percentage of the return on assets to the balance at the end of December 2017 is about 0.719%. Yep, that feels correct once more.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In 2017, the percent of the return on assets relative to the balance at the end of December was approximately 0.719%.

heads around these numbers. We need to figure out how much the net loss changed between 2001 and 2002 based on the American Tower Corporation's financial data. So, looking at the net loss figures, it says the reported net loss for 2002 was $1,141,879, and in 2001 it was $450,094. First step, calculate how much it changed by just subtracting the two. Simple enough, right? So, $1,141,879 minus $450,094 gives us an actual change of $691,785.\n\nNow that we know the change in dollar terms, let's think about how we can express that in terms of a percentage. We use the original amount, which is the 2001 net loss. So, the percentage change formula comes to mind: (change divided by the original value) times 100 to get it from a fraction to a percentage.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we have $691,785 divided by $450,094. We want to multiply that result by 100 to get a percentage. Doing the math, it looks like it comes out to roughly 153.74%. That's quite a leap, isn't it?\n\nIt seems like our number crunching all checks out, so we confidently say the net loss increased by approximately 153.74% from 2001 to 2002. It's always a good idea to double check our steps: the basic subtraction was straightforward, and the division to get the percentage wasn't too tricky. We'd better double check the numbers we plugged in, too, just to be sure we didn't make any mistakes. \n\nThe numbers seem consistent. So yeah, from 2001 to 2002, the reported net loss jumped by about 153.74%. That's itâ€”it looks like we're done here!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The reported net loss for the American Tower Corporation increased from $450,094 in 2001 to $1,141,879 in 2002. To calculate the percentage change in the net loss, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change} = \\left(\\frac{1,141,879 - 450,094}{450,094}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 153.74\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, based on the financial data provided, the net loss increased by approximately 153.74% from 2001 to 2002.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: comparison of five-year cumulative total return the following graph compares the cumulative total return on citigroup 2019s common stock with the s&amp;p 500 index and the s&amp;p financial index over the five-year period extending through december 31 , 2009 . the graph assumes that $ 100 was invested on december 31 , 2004 in citigroup 2019s common stock , the s&amp;p 500 index and the s&amp;p financial index and that all dividends were reinvested . citigroup s&amp;p 500 index s&amp;p financial index 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 comparison of five-year cumulative total return for the years ended .\n|december 31|citigroup|s&amp;p 500 index|s&amp;p financial index|\n|2005|104.38|104.83|106.30|\n|2006|124.02|121.20|126.41|\n|2007|70.36|127.85|103.47|\n|2008|18.71|81.12|47.36|\n|2009|9.26|102.15|55.27|\n.\nQuestion: what was the ratio of cumulative total return for citigroup compared to the s&amp;p 500 index in 2007\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.55033&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's figure out how Citigroup's performance stacked up against the S&amp;P 500 index in 2007. First, I need to pull the numbers from the table. According to the data, Citigroup had a cumulative total return of 70.36 in 2007. Now, let's see what the S&amp;P 500 index was at during the same year â€” it was 127.85. \n\nHaving these two numbers, I want to find out how Citigroup's return compares to the S&amp;P 500. The way to do this is by calculating the ratio. This is done by dividing Citigroup's total return by the S&amp;P 500's total return. So, Iâ€™ll take 70.36 and divide it by 127.85. \n\nOkay, let's do the math. When I divide 70.36 by 127.85, I get approximately 0.5503. Hmm, it's starting to make sense now. \n\nIn simple terms, this means that Citigroup's return in 2007 was about 55% of what the S&amp;P 500 achieved in the same year. \n\nI should double-check this to be sure. Yes, I divided correctly, and the numbers were pulled directly from the table. So, it seems accurate.\n\nGreat, now we've got a clear picture: Citigroup's 2007 cumulative return compared to the S&amp;P 500 was roughly around 0.5503.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In 2007, the ratio of Citigroup's cumulative total return to the S&amp;P 500 index's cumulative total return was approximately 0.5503.

Alright, first I need to know what the expenses were for both years. I see here that in 2010, the expenses were $41.3 million. And for 2011, they were $43.1 million. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find out how much the expenses increased. Iâ€™ll subtract the 2010 expenses from the 2011 expenses. So, $43.1 million minus $41.3 million gives me a $1.8 million increase. \n\nNow, to find the percent change, I should take the increase and divide it by the 2010 expenses, and then multiply the result by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Letâ€™s do that calculation: $1.8 million divided by $41.3 million, then taking that result and multiplying by 100, gives about 4.36%. \n\nOh, wait, let me just double-check everything. Yep, the increase was indeed $1.8 million, and dividing this by $41.3 million and multiplying by 100 gives me this number again, about 4.36%. \n\nSo, that means in 2011, the general and administrative expenses went up by roughly 4.36%. Sounds about right, considering my calculations. Letâ€™s conclude with confidence that the percent change was indeed around 4.36%.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The general and administrative expenses increased from $41.3 million in 2010 to $43.1 million in 2011. To determine the percent change, you calculate the increase, which is $43.1 million minus $41.3 million, equaling $1.8 million. Then, divide the increase by the 2010 expenses, which is $41.3 million, and multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage. \n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Change} = \\left(\\frac{1.8}{41.3}\\right) \\times

out what percentage of industrial packaging sales in 2004 was represented by containerboard net sales. Let me first remind myself of the numbers involved.\n\nOkay, so from the data given, containerboard's net sales in 2004 were $951 million. And for industrial packaging, the sales were $4,830 million in the same year.\n\nNow, how do I find the percentage? Oh right, I need to use that simple percentage formula: (Containerboard Sales / Industrial Packaging Sales) * 100. It helps to know what share one amount is of another.\n\nDoing the math now: I divide 951 by 4,830. Let me see what that gives me. That comes out to around 0.196978. Cool, that's the decimal form.\n\nHmm, but I want a percentage, so I just need to multiply this by 100, converting it to 19.6978.\n\nOh, but percentages typically aren't shown with so many decimals, right? It's better to round it. Let's round it to one decimal place. That would be approximately 19.7%. So I've got my answer.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more that I've got the sales figures right. Containerboard sales were indeed $951 million, and industrial packaging sales stood at $4,830 million.\n\nJust to be extra certain, I'll run through the calculation again: $951 million divided by $4,830 million equals about 0.196891. Then, multiplying 0.196891 by 100 to get a percentage gives me 19.6891%.\n\nWith the calculation and rounding differences taken into account, I can say that containerboard's net sales were approximately 19.69% of industrial packaging sales in 2004. Perfect, it matches, and I can be confident with the final figure!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Containerboard's net sales represented approximately 19.7% of industrial packaging sales in 2004.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments , as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk . we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations , whether through acquisitions or public-private partnerships , which allow us to reduce capital and expense requirements associated with truck routing , personnel , fleet maintenance , inventories and back-office administration . operating model the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent , high quality service to all of our customers through the republic way : one way . everywhere . every day . this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence . the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business . a key enabler of the republic way is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360 degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management , supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise . this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets , while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics . we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient and environmentally sound way . fleet automation approximately 74% ( 74 % ) of our residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks . by converting our residential routes to automated service , we reduce labor costs , improve driver productivity , decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees . additionally , communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs , thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities . fleet conversion to compressed natural gas ( cng ) approximately 18% ( 18 % ) of our fleet operates on natural gas . we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng , our preferred alternative fuel technology , as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process . we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments . approximately 36% ( 36 % ) of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2016 were cng vehicles . we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment . although upfront capital costs are higher , using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses . as of december 31 , 2016 , we operated 38 cng fueling stations . standardized maintenance based on an industry trade publication , we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states . as of december 31 , 2016 , our average fleet age in years , by line of business , was as follows : approximate number of vehicles approximate average age .\n||approximate number of vehicles|approximate average age|\n|residential|7300|7|\n|small-container commercial|4400|7|\n|large-container industrial|4100|9|\n|total|15800|7.5|\n.\nQuestion: as of december 312016 what was the ratio of the approximate number of residential vehicles to the large-container industrial\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1.78049&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;First, let's figure out the numbers we're dealing with. According to the data from the end of 2016, there were about 7,300 residential vehicles and 4,100 large-container industrial vehicles. So, if we want to find the ratio between these two groups of vehicles, we start by simply writing it as 7,300 to 4,100.\n\nNow, I think it makes more sense if we simplify this ratio. Ratios are easier to interpret when theyâ€™re simplified, right? To do that, we should find a number that can divide both 7,300 and 4,100 evenly. Let's see, they both seem to end in two zeros, so without thinking too much, dividing by 100 seems like a good first step.\n\nDividing both 7,300 and 4,100 by 100 gives us 73 to 41. That was neat! So now we have a cleaner, simplified ratio: 73:41.\n\nBut just to be double sure, letâ€™s verify this by using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a handy way to find the greatest common divisor (GCD). Weâ€™re really just confirming here, so let's go through it:\n\nWhen 7,300 is divided by 4,100, it leaves a remainder of 3,200. Then, divide 4,100 by 3,200 and get a remainder of 900. Whatâ€™s next? 3,200 divided by 900 leaves 500. Continuing, 900 by 500 leaves 400. Then 500 by 400 leaves a remainder of 100. Finally, dividing 400 by 100 gives a remainder of 0. Oh, awesome, that means 100 is indeed the GCD.\n\nSo yeah, dividing the original numbers, 7,300 and 4,100, by 100â€”just what we did initiallyâ€”gives us this simplified 73 to 41 ratio. It feels good to verify that math!\n\nNow, let's also think about this ratio in another way. What if we expressed it as a decimal instead? Dividing 7,300 by 4,100 gives us around 1.78049. This decimal lets us see the ratio more intuitively, in terms of how many residential vehicles there are per large-container industrial vehicle.\n\nYet, the simplified ratio of 73:41 matches the analysis pretty well, showing that for every 73 residential vehicles, there are 41 large-container industrial ones.\n\nUltimately, the process of both simplifying and verifying with different methods confirms the ratio nicely, ending at 73:41 as of December 31, 2016.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The ratio of the approximate number of

down. I need to figure out the percentage increase in employee contributions between 2002 and 2003 for the 401(k) plan. \n\nFirst off, the company's matching rates were consistent during this period. They matched 35% of employee contributions up to 5% of what the employees contributed in both 2002 and 2003. \n\nWhat I have is the company's contributions. In 2002, the company contributed $979,000, and in 2003, it was $825,000. \n\nSince the match rate was the same both years, I can say that $979,000 in 2002 and $825,000 in 2003 represented 35% of the employee contributions. But how do I get the total employee contributions from this?\n\nOh, right! To find the total employee contributions, I just need to reverse the percentage. So, for 2002, I divide $979,000 by 0.35. Hmm, doing the math, that gives $2,797,143 for total employee contributions in 2002.\n\nNow, for 2003, I do the same thing: divide $825,000 by 0.35. Alright, that works out to $2,357,143 for 2003.\n\nNext, I need to find out how the contributions changed from 2002 to 2003. This means calculating the percentage change. I take the difference between the contributions in 2003 and 2002, which is $2,357,143 minus $2,797,143.\n\nWait, the result looks like a decrease because it's negative.

We begin with a hefty initial investment of $1,000,000. Hmm, the starting point of the index is $100.00 on that day.\n\nNow, fast forward to May 31, 2015. The value of the S&amp;P 500 index has climbed up to $171.40. So, how much has our investment grown in these three years?\n\nFirst, I should find out how much the index grew by calculating the return multiplier. I'll divide the ending index value, $171.40, by the starting value of $100.00. Let's see... the result is 1.714.\n\nThis means the index grew by a factor of 1.714. Not too bad! Now, applying this growth to our initial $1,000,000 gives us a clearer picture of the return.\n\nDoing the math: we multiply $1,000,000 by 1.714. And there it is... the investment now stands at $1,714,000 by the time we reach May 31, 2015.\n\nAnd there you have it, the total return on our initial $1,000,000 investment is $1,714,000. I should double-check this, no harm in doing the multiplication again. Yep, everything checks out!\n\nSo the final conclusion is quite straightforward: we have a total return of $1,714,000 on our investment in the S&amp;P 500 from May 31, 2012, to May 31, 2015.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The total return on a $1,000,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 index from May 31, 2012, to May 31, 2015, can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Compute the growth factor by dividing the S&amp;P 500 index value on May 31, 2015, ($171.40) by the value on May 31, 2012, ($100.00). This growth factor is 1.714.\n\n2. Multiply the initial investment amount by this growth factor: $1,000,000 * 1.714 = $1,714,000.\n\nThus, the total return on your investment would be $1,714,000.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: marathon oil corporation notes to consolidated financial statements 7 . dispositions outside-operated norwegian properties 2013 on october 31 , 2008 , we closed the sale of our norwegian outside-operated properties and undeveloped offshore acreage in the heimdal area of the norwegian north sea for net proceeds of $ 301 million , with a pretax gain of $ 254 million as of december 31 , 2008 . pilot travel centers 2013 on october 8 , 2008 , we completed the sale of our 50 percent ownership interest in ptc . sale proceeds were $ 625 million , with a pretax gain on the sale of $ 126 million . immediately preceding the sale , we received a $ 75 million partial redemption of our ownership interest from ptc that was accounted for as a return of investment . operated irish properties 2013 on december 17 , 2008 , we agreed to sell our operated properties located in ireland for proceeds of $ 180 million , before post-closing adjustments and cash on hand at closing . closing is subject to completion of the necessary administrative processes . as of december 31 , 2008 , operating assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale , as disclosed by major class in the following table : ( in millions ) 2008 .\n|( in millions )|2008|\n|current assets|$ 164|\n|noncurrent assets|103|\n|total assets|267|\n|current liabilities|62|\n|noncurrent liabilities|199|\n|total liabilities|261|\n|net assets held for sale|$ 6|\n8 . discontinued operations on june 2 , 2006 , we sold our russian oil exploration and production businesses in the khanty-mansiysk region of western siberia . under the terms of the agreement , we received $ 787 million for these businesses , plus preliminary working capital and other closing adjustments of $ 56 million , for a total transaction value of $ 843 million . proceeds net of transaction costs and cash held by the russian businesses at the transaction date totaled $ 832 million . a gain on the sale of $ 243 million ( $ 342 million before income taxes ) was reported in discontinued operations for 2006 . income taxes on this gain were reduced by the utilization of a capital loss carryforward . exploration and production segment goodwill of $ 21 million was allocated to the russian assets and reduced the reported gain . adjustments to the sales price were completed in 2007 and an additional gain on the sale of $ 8 million ( $ 13 million before income taxes ) was recognized . the activities of the russian businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2006 . revenues applicable to discontinued operations were $ 173 million and pretax income from discontinued operations was $ 45 million for 2006. .\nQuestion: what is working capital for 2008?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;102.0&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's figure out what the working capital for 2008 is.

I'll need both of those numbers for our calculations.\n\nNow, let's think about how to find this percentage. It's the fully insured part divided by the total commercial members, and then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

The competitive supply segment for 2000 shows total revenues of $2.4 billion. That's quite a jump from the $873 million they had in 1999. What's making up this huge increase? The report mentions that a lot of this increase came from contributions from the New York plants and New Energy. So my task is to figure out what the revenue would have been without these contributions.\n\nNow, it says that if we exclude businesses acquired or those that started operating in 2000 or 1999, the revenues would be $477 million. This is clearly a much smaller amount compared to the total $2.4 billion, meaning these acquisitions and new operations had a big impact.\n\nHmm, so let's break it down. If competitive supply revenue excluding new businesses was $477 million in 2000, then the new businesses must have contributed the difference to reach that $2.4 billion mark. But how much did just the New York plants and New Energy contribute?\n\nWe don't have the exact number, just that they had a 'significant' impact. The overall competitive supply segment revenue jumped by $1.5 billion from $873 million to $2.4 billion. Waitâ€”there's a clue saying North America, which includes the New York plants and New Energy, saw a revenue increase of $610 million.\n\nSo let's consider this. If the $477 million figure represents revenue without any new entities, then additional contributions, including the significant ones from North America, including New York plants and New Energy, played a vital role in bridging the gap to reach $2.4 billion. That means without these North America contributions, including the New York plants and New Energy, we're dividing up this hefty increase to see what's left.\n\nGiven that North America's rise was primarily due to the New York addition, without theseâ€”especially considering that $610 million increaseâ€”our estimate fits more naturally when subtracting from overall figures. Excluding this $610 million from the total suggests revenues would be around $1.79 billion. Even though this is a simplified breakdown, it provides a close estimate considering the robust impact of these new operations in North America and other established differences.\n\nThis kind of revenue change is dynamic, especially when new entities or operations swing the financial landscape so heavily. In any case, it emphasizes how much impact new ventures in competitive areas can have when they produce sizable contributions like here.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Without the contributions from the New York plants and New Energy, the 2000 competitive supply segment revenues would have been $1.79 billion. This is derived by subtracting the $610 million increase attributed to North America, which includes these significant contributions, from the total $2.4 billion revenue for that year.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:27,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial

the percentage change in the carrying amount on the balance sheet from one year to the next. So, I see that for December 31, 2018, the carrying amount was $556 million. For the previous year, December 31, 2017, it was $426 million. First, I need to find out how much the carrying amount increased over that year. I'll take the 2018 amount, $556 million, and subtract the 2017 amount, which is $426 million. That gives us an increase of $130 million.\n\nNow, let's see what that increase means in terms of percentage. I need to compare the increase to the 2017 amount because that's our starting point. So, I'll take the $130 million increase and divide it by the 2017 amount, $426 million. Hmm, I'm getting approximately 0.3052 when I do that division.\n\nOkay, now to turn that into a percentage, I just multiply by 100. So, 0.3052 times 100 gives me about 30.52%. Wow, that's a pretty significant increase!\n\nJust to be sure, Iâ€™ll go over it once more: $556 million minus $426 million is $130 million. Then $130 million divided by $426 million is about 0.3052. When multiplied by 100, we get roughly 30.52%. Everything checks out!

In 2011, the net sales stood at a solid $108,249 million. Then in 2012, they jumped up to $156,508 million. Okay, so it looks like there was quite an increase from one year to the next. \n\nNow, to really understand the change, we should look at how big this difference actually is. So, if we take the 2012 figure and subtract the 2011 figure from it, that would be $156,508 million minus $108,249 million. Let me do the math... ah, yes, that's $48,259 million. That's a pretty substantial growth in net sales! \n\nBut numbers alone don't tell us how big this change is in a relative sense, do they? It's time to calculate the percentage change to get a clearer picture. Now, the percentage change is usually found by dividing the change by the original number. So, we divide $48,259 million by the 2011 sales of $108,249 million. Let me crunch those numbers... okay, that gives us approximately 0.4459. \n\nLetâ€™s not forget to convert this figure into a percentage. Multiplying that by 100 will do the trick. When we do that, we find that the net sales experienced an increase of about 44.59%. \n\nSo, the net sales saw a jump of roughly 44.59% from 2011 to 2012. That's quite a significant rise in just one year.

Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.0&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To find the percentage increase in shares from 2011 to 2012, I need to start by figuring out how many shares were outstanding at the beginning and end of 2012. Alright, at the end of 2011, there were 1,432,610 shares. By the end of 2012, this had increased to 1,913,527 shares.\n\nNow, let's see how many more shares were there by the end of 2012 compared to 2011. Subtracting the two numbers will give me that change: 1,913,527 minus 1,432,610 equals 480,917. So, there were 480,917 more shares at the end of 2012.\n\nOkay, moving on to calculate the percentage increase. This is done by dividing the change in shares by the original number of shares and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Plugging the numbers in gives me (480,917 / 1,432,610) times 100. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, this calculation gives me about 33.56%. So, the number of shares grew by roughly 33.56% from 2011 to 2012.\n\nLet me just quickly check my assumptions and numbers to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The starting number of shares indeed was 1,432,610 at the end of 2011, and the ending number for 2012 was 1,913,527. And my math with the subtraction and division seems right.\n\nWait, but the context mentioned details about specific share transactions like shares granted, vested, and cancelled throughout 2012.

We want to see how much money we would've made by putting $100 into Global Payments versus the S&amp;P Information Technology Index.\n\nFirst, let's start with Global Payments. We initially put in $100, and by the end of 2017, that investment is worth $474.52. To find out how much it's grown, we'll subtract our initial $100 from $474.52. That gives us $374.52.\n\nOkay, so now we take that growth amount, $374.52, and see what percentage it represents of our initial $100 investment. We do this by dividing $374.52 by $100 and multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage. Crunching those numbers, we get a growth percentage of 374.52% for Global Payments.\n\nNow, let's compare that with the S&amp;P Information Technology Index. Iâ€™ll start with another $100 investment here. By the end of the same period in 2017, it's grown to $269.45. Again, we'll calculate the growth by subtracting the initial $100 from $269.45, which leaves us with $169.45.\n\nTo find out what percentage that is of our initial investment, we'll divide $169.45 by $100 and then multiply by 100, which gives us a growth of 169.45% for the tech index.\n\nSo, where do we stand? Global Payments grew by 374.52%, while the S&amp;P Information Technology Index grew by 169.45%. If we compare these two, Global Payments did better.\n\nFinally, let's figure out the difference in performance. We need to subtract the tech index's growth percentage from Global Payments' growth percentage. So, 374.52% minus 169.45% gives us a difference of 205.07%.\n\nThis means that investing in Global Payments gave us a 205.07% greater return compared to the tech index. Sweet, that's quite the difference!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The percentage gained by investing $100 into Global Payments, in comparison to the S&amp;P Information Technology Index over the period ending on December 31, 2017, was 205.07% greater. Investing in Global Payments resulted in a total return of 374.52%, while the S&amp;P Information Technology Index yielded a 169.45% return. Thus, Global Payments outperformed the technology index by 205.07%.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: will no longer be significant contributors to business operating results , while expenses should also decline significantly reflecting the reduced level of operations . operating earnings will primarily consist of retail forestland and real estate sales of remaining acreage . specialty businesses and other the specialty businesses and other segment includes the results of the arizona chemical business and certain divested businesses whose results are included in this segment for periods prior to their sale or closure . this segment 2019s 2006 net sales increased 2% ( 2 % ) from 2005 , but declined 17% ( 17 % ) from 2004 . operating profits in 2006 were up substantially from both 2005 and 2004 . the decline in sales compared with 2004 principally reflects declining contributions from businesses sold or closed . specialty businesses and other in millions 2006 2005 2004 .\n|in millions|2006|2005|2004|\n|sales|$ 935|$ 915|$ 1120|\n|operating profit|$ 61|$ 4|$ 38|\narizona chemical sales were $ 769 million in 2006 , compared with $ 692 million in 2005 and $ 672 million in 2004 . sales volumes declined in 2006 compared with 2005 , but average sales price realiza- tions in 2006 were higher in both the united states and europe . operating earnings in 2006 were sig- nificantly higher than in 2005 and more than 49% ( 49 % ) higher than in 2004 . the increase over 2005 reflects the impact of the higher average sales price realiza- tions and lower manufacturing costs , partially offset by higher prices for crude tall oil ( cto ) . earnings for 2005 also included a $ 13 million charge related to a plant shutdown in norway . other businesses in this operating segment include operations that have been sold , closed or held for sale , primarily the polyrey business in france and , in prior years , the european distribution business . sales for these businesses were approximately $ 166 million in 2006 , compared with $ 223 million in 2005 and $ 448 million in 2004 . in december 2006 , the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the arizona chemical business , expected to close in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper 2019s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operat- ing cash flow , which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products . while changes in key cash operating costs , such as energy and raw material costs , do have an effect on operating cash generation , we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle . as part of the continuing focus on improving our return on investment , we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america . spending levels have been kept below the level of depreciation and amortization charges for each of the last three years , and we anticipate spending will again be slightly below depreciation and amor- tization in 2007 . financing activities in 2006 have been focused on the transformation plan objective of strengthening the balance sheet through repayment of debt , resulting in a net reduction in 2006 of $ 5.2 billion following a $ 1.7 billion net reduction in 2005 . additionally , we made a $ 1.0 billion voluntary cash contribution to our u.s . qualified pension plan in december 2006 to begin satisfying projected long-term funding requirements and to lower future pension expense . our liquidity position continues to be strong , with approximately $ 3.0 billion of committed liquidity to cover future short-term cash flow requirements not met by operating cash flows . management believes it is important for interna- tional paper to maintain an investment-grade credit rating to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms . at december 31 , 2006 , the com- pany held long-term credit ratings of bbb ( stable outlook ) and baa3 ( stable outlook ) from standard &amp;

We're given that in 2004, it was $1.7 billion, in 2005 it was $1.2 billion, and in 2006 it was $1.0 billion.\n\nNow let's add those up to see the total cash provided over the three years. So, $1.7 billion plus $1.2 billion plus $1.0 billion gives us $3.9 billion in total.\n\nWe need to find the average cash for each year. Since we're talking about three years, I should divide the total $3.9 billion by 3. That should do it, right? Oh wait, hold on...\n\nThere's this note about a $1.0 billion voluntary cash pension plan contribution in 2006. It seems like the $1.0 billion cash provided for that year was after this contribution. Interesting, so before the adjustment, it should have been $2.0 billion for 2006.\n\nOkay, let me adjust my total calculation then. I should replace the $1.0 billion for 2006 with $2.0 billion. So what do we have now? $1.7 billion for 2004, $1.2 billion for 2005, and $2.0 billion for 2006. Ah, that's $4.9 billion altogether.\n\nNow I need to find the average cash provided over these three years with these adjusted figures. $4.9 billion divided by 3 years. Hmm, let me do that math... And that comes out to roughly $1.633 billion per year.\n\nSo, after adjusting for everything, the average cash provided by continuing operations from 2004 to 2006 is about $1.633 billion. This makes sense considering all the adjustments we made, especially with the pension contribution in 2006 being factored back in.

I've got these cumulative total return numbers to work with, and I need to find out their growth ratios.\n\nFirst, I'm going to check the cumulative total return for both Citi and the S&amp;P 500 as of December 31, 2013. Citi's return was $110.49, and for the S&amp;P 500, it was $156.82.\n\nThese returns are based on an initial investment of $100 made at the end of 2010. So, let me figure out how much each has grown since then. For Citi, I subtract that initial $100 from $110.49, which gives $10.49. That's the growth amount for Citi.\n\nNow, for the S&amp;P 500, I do the same thing. Subtracting the initial $100 from $156.82 gives me $56.82. That's quite an increase for the S&amp;P 500!\n\nNext step is to sort of normalize this growth in terms of percentages to get a clearer picture. So for Citi, I calculate the growth percentage like this: take that $10.49 growth and divide it by the initial $100, and then multiply by 100. This gives a growth percentage of 10.49% for Citi.\n\nFor the S&amp;P 500, it's the same process. Take the $56.82 growth, divide by $100, and multiply by 100. This results in a growth percentage of 56.82% for the S&amp;P 500.\n\nNow, it's time to see how Citi's growth stacks up against the S&amp;P 500's. I need to divide Citi's growth percentage by the S&amp;P 500's growth percentage. Doing this, 10.49% divided by 56.82%, I get approximately 0.1846.\n\nSo, if I round to four decimal places, the ratio of Citi's growth compared to the S&amp;P 500's growth in 2013 is about 0.1846. It's a smaller proportion, indicating that the S&amp;P 500 had a significantly higher growth over that period. Just to be sure, I'll quickly revisit my steps, and yes, all the calculations check out. That should be accurate.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In 2013, the cumulative total return for Citi was $110.49, while for the S&amp;P 500 it was $156.82. Based on an initial investment of $100 at the end of 2010, Citi's growth was $10.49 ($110.49 - $100) and the S&amp;P 500's growth was $56.82 ($156.82 - $100). \n\nTo find the growth percentage:  \n- Citi: ($10.49 / $100) * 100 = 10.49%\n- S&amp;P 500: ($56.82 / $100) * 100 = 56.82%\n\nThe ratio of Citi's growth compared to the S&amp;P 500's growth is calculated as 10.49% / 56.82% = 0.1846.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the growth of the cumulative total return for Citi compared to the S&amp;P 500 in 2013 is approximately 0.1846.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: american tower corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements loss on retirement of long-term obligations 2014loss on retirement of long-term obligations primarily includes cash paid to retire debt in excess of its carrying value , cash paid to holders of convertible notes in connection with note conversions and non-cash charges related to the write-off of deferred financing fees . loss on retirement of long-term obligations also includes gains from repurchasing or refinancing certain of the company 2019s debt obligations . earnings per common share 2014basic and diluted 2014basic income from continuing operations per common share for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 represents income from continuing operations attributable to american tower corporation divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period . diluted income from continuing operations per common share for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 represents income from continuing operations attributable to american tower corporation divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents , including unvested restricted stock , shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants as determined under the treasury stock method and upon conversion of the company 2019s convertible notes , as determined under the if-converted method . retirement plan 2014the company has a 401 ( k ) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements . the company 2019s matching contribution for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is 50% ( 50 % ) up to a maximum 6% ( 6 % ) of a participant 2019s contributions . for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the company contributed approximately $ 4.4 million , $ 2.9 million and $ 1.9 million to the plan , respectively . 2 . prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets consist of the following as of december 31 , ( in thousands ) : .\n||2012|2011 ( 1 )|\n|prepaid income tax|$ 57665|$ 31384|\n|prepaid operating ground leases|56916|49585|\n|value added tax and other consumption tax receivables|22443|81276|\n|prepaid assets|19037|28031|\n|other miscellaneous current assets|66790|59997|\n|balance as of december 31,|$ 222851|$ 250273|\n( 1 ) december 31 , 2011 balances have been revised to reflect purchase accounting measurement period adjustments. .\nQuestion: for 2012 , tax related assets were how much of total current assets and prepaids?\\\\n\\\\n\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;0.35947&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We want to figure out how much of the total current assets and prepaids in 2012 were related to taxes.\n\nFirst, letâ€™s identify what we have. We're specifically looking at 'prepaid income tax' here, and in 2012, its value was $57,665.\n\nNow, let's find out what the total of the 'prepaid and other current assets' is for that year. I see that it's $222,851.\n\nOkay, now I need to find out what portion this prepaid income tax makes up of the total. Itâ€™s division time! So, we take $57,665 and divide it by $222,851. Let's do the math.\n\nDoing this division gives us approximately 0.2587. If we convert this into a percentage to make it easier to interpret, we multiply by 100, which gives us roughly 25.87%.\n\nHold on, letâ€™s double-check that. Sometimes, it's good to revisit the numbers to make sure nothing was missed. Iâ€™ll divide $57,665 by $222,851 again just to confirm.\n\nAlright, I repeated the calculation, and indeed, the result is about 0.259 when rounded, which translates to around 25.9%. \n\nThis means the prepaid income tax accounts for about 25.9% of the total current assets and prepaids for 2012.\n\nIt's always satisfying when the numbers check out. That should be the answer!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;For the year 2012, the prepaid income tax, which is tax-related, amounted to $57,665. This figure was a part of the total 'prepaid and other current assets', which summed up to $222,851 for the same year.\n\nTo determine what portion of the total assets and prepaids were related to taxes, we calculate the percentage that the prepaid income tax represents out of the total. The calculation is as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Prepaid Income Tax}}{\\text{Total Prepaid and Other Current Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage}

Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;-0.0372&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Okay, let's start by understanding what's going on here. We're looking at a breakdown of cash flows, and we have two main components: tower cash flow and non-tower cash flow. The time period we're dealing with is for the twelve months ending December 31, 2006. \n\nFirst up, the non-tower cash flow is given to us as a negative number, -$22,614. This tells me that the non-tower cash activities resulted in a cash outflow. Thatâ€™s interesting because it means these activities didnâ€™t generate cash, but rather consumed it.\n\nNow, weâ€™re also given the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the same time period, which is $607,928. This number is a combination of both our tower and non-tower cash flows. \n\nThe question asks what proportion of this total is due to the non-tower part. Since we have the figures, it's just a matter of figuring out the percentage. To do this, you take the non-tower cash flow amount, which is -$22,614, and divide it by the total adjusted consolidated cash flow of $607,928.\n\nDoing the math gives me a figure. Let's see, -22,614 divided by 607,928...that works out to about -0.0372 when converted to a decimal. Ah, so if I express this as a percentage, itâ€™s approximately -3.72%. \n\nThis negative percentage confirms that the non-tower activities not only had a small impact on the total cash flow picture but also that the impact was detrimental, being a cash loss rather than gain.\n\nAlright, that sums it up, and it all checks out nicely with the numbers presented.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The portion of the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, that is related to non-tower cash flow is approximately -3.72%. This negative percentage indicates that the non-tower cash flow had a cash outflow effect and detracted from the total adjusted consolidated cash flow.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate , foreign currency , commodity , and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of may 26 , 2019 and may 27 , 2018 , and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 26 , 2019. .\n|in millions|fair value impact may 26 2019|fair value impact averageduringfiscal 2019|fair value impact may 27 2018|\n|interest rate instruments|$ 74.4|$ 46.1|$ 33.2|\n|foreign currency instruments|16.8|19.0|21.3|\n|commodity instruments|4.1|2.5|1.9|\n|equity instruments|2.3|2.2|2.0|\n.\nQuestion: what is the change in fair value of foreign currency instruments from 2018 to 2019?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;-4.5&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's start by looking at the fair value of those foreign currency instruments for the two years we're interested in.\n\nFirst up, for May 27, 2018, we have $21.3 million as the fair value impact.\n\nThen, moving on to the following year, for May 26, 2019, the fair value is sitting at $16.8 million.\n\nNow, let's figure out the difference between these two numbers. We need to see how much the fair value has changed from 2018 to 2019.\n\nSo, we take the 2019 value, which is $16.8 million, and subtract the 2018 value, $21.3 million. Doing the math, we have $16.8 million minus $21.3 million.\n\nCalculating this, the result is -$4.5 million. That negative sign indicates a decrease in fair value.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure we're on the right track...yes, the 2018 value is definitely $21.3 million, and the 2019 value is indeed $16.8 million.\n\nGreat, everything checks out. So, we can conclude that the change in fair value for these foreign currency instruments from 2018 to 2019 is a decrease of $4.5 million.&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The change in fair value of foreign currency instruments from 2018 to 2019 is a decrease of $4.5 million.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:36,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Open-ended Verifiable Question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: our international networks segment owns and operates the following television networks , which reached the following number of subscribers via pay television services as of december 31 , 2013 : global networks international subscribers ( millions ) regional networks international subscribers ( millions ) .\n|global networks discovery channel|internationalsubscribers ( millions ) 271|regional networks discovery kids|internationalsubscribers ( millions ) 76|\n|animal planet|200|sbs nordic ( a )|28|\n|tlc real time and travel &amp; living|162|dmax ( b )|16|\n|discovery science|81|discovery history|14|\n|investigation discovery|74|shed|12|\n|discovery home &amp; health|64|discovery en espanol ( u.s. )|5|\n|turbo|52|discovery familia ( u.s. )|4|\n|discovery world|23|gxt|4|\n( a ) number of subscribers corresponds to the collective sum of the total number of subscribers to each of the sbs nordic broadcast networks in sweden , norway , and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with pay television providers . ( b ) number of subscribers corresponds to dmax pay television networks in the u.k. , austria , switzerland and ireland . our international networks segment also owns and operates free-to-air television networks which reached 285 million cumulative viewers in europe and the middle east as of december 31 , 2013 . our free-to-air networks include dmax , fatafeat , quest , real time , giallo , frisbee , focus and k2 . similar to u.s . networks , the primary sources of revenue for international networks are fees charged to operators who distribute our networks , which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers , and advertising sold on our television networks . international television markets vary in their stages of development . some markets , such as the u.k. , are more advanced digital television markets , while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies . common practice in some markets results in long-term contractual distribution relationships , while customers in other markets renew contracts annually . distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content , the rates negotiated in the agreements , and the market demand for the content that we provide . advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and free-to-air television markets , the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels , viewership demographics , the popularity of our programming , and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels . in certain markets , our advertising sales business operates with in-house sales teams , while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets . in developing television markets , we expect that advertising revenue growth will result from continued subscriber and viewership growth , our localization strategy , and the shift of advertising spending from traditional analog networks to channels in the multi-channel environment . in relatively mature markets , such as western europe , growth in advertising revenue will come from increasing viewership and pricing of advertising on our existing television networks and the launching of new services , both organic and through acquisitions . during 2013 , distribution , advertising and other revenues were 50% ( 50 % ) , 47% ( 47 % ) and 3% ( 3 % ) , respectively , of total net revenues for this segment . on january 21 , 2014 , we entered into an agreement with tf1 to acquire a controlling interest in eurosport international ( \&quot;eurosport\&quot; ) , a leading pan-european sports media platform , by increasing our ownership stake from 20% ( 20 % ) to 51% ( 51 % ) for cash of approximately 20ac253 million ( $ 343 million ) subject to working capital adjustments . due to regulatory constraints the acquisition initially excludes eurosport france , a subsidiary of eurosport . we will retain a 20% ( 20 % ) equity interest in eurosport france and a commitment to acquire another 31% ( 31 % ) ownership interest beginning 2015 , contingent upon resolution of all regulatory matters . the flagship eurosport network focuses on regionally popular sports such as tennis , skiing , cycling and motor sports and reaches 133 million homes across 54 countries in 20 languages . eurosport 2019s brands and platforms also include eurosport hd ( high definition simulcast ) , eurosport 2 , eurosport 2 hd ( high definition simulcast ) , eurosport asia-pacific , and eurosportnews . the acquisition is intended to increase the growth of eurosport and enhance our pay television offerings in europe . tf1 will have the right to put the entirety of its remaining 49% ( 49 % ) non-controlling interest to us for approximately two and a half years after completion of this acquisition . the put has a floor value equal to the fair value at the acquisition date if exercised in the 90 day period beginning on july 1 , 2015 and is subsequently priced at fair value if exercised in the 90 day period beginning on july 1 , 2016 . we expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter of 2014 subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. .\nQuestion: what was the difference in millions of international subscribers between discovery channel and discovery science?\nAnswer:&quot;},&quot;Ground-True Answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;190.0&quot;},&quot;Complex_CoT&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Alright, let's figure out how many more international subscribers the Discovery Channel has compared to Discovery Science. First, I need to know how many people subscribe to each. From the data, Discovery Channel has 271 million subscribers outside the US. Now, I need to check for Discovery Science. It looks like they have 81 million international subscribers.\n\nOkay, now to find how much more the Discovery Channel has, I just subtract the number of Discovery Science subscribers from those of the Discovery Channel. So, 271 million minus 81 million should give me the answer.\n\nLet me do that math real quick. 271 minus 81 is... hmm, okay, yes that's 190 million.\n\nIn conclusion, Discovery Channel has 190 million more international subscribers than Discovery Science. This makes sense given the popularity of Discovery Channel. So, there we have it!&quot;},&quot;Response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The difference in millions of international subscribers between Discovery Channel and Discovery Science is 190 million.&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:5499,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkxODgyMiwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL1RoZUZpbkFJL0Zpbm8xX1JlYXNvbmluZ19QYXRoX0ZpblFBIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQyOTIyNDIyLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2h1Z2dpbmdmYWNlLmNvIn0.U5JFT62f8csfaQB4jmm_LYAYDxihkIF6TO_rAzXYfC5UMiHp2K5kajnbQfFwbcV6y0yJD2WE31d1hvej0XLUCA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;TheFinAI/Fino1_Reasoning_Path_FinQA&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63b58ed5889aa6707f0bb0f4/ZK5nQKw34W3-eH3p4NAYc.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;The Fin AI&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TheFinAI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;org&quot;,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;isEnterprise&quot;:true,&quot;followerCount&quot;:122},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's dive into this question about amortization expenses. First, I need to identify the table that illustrates the estimated amortization expenses from 2017 onwards. It looks like this table is super important in figuring out the expense for 2017. 

Okay, found it! The table clearly states that the estimated amortization expense for the year 2017 is $10,509, but it notes that this is in thousands. 

Let me think for a second. If the numbers are in thousands, that means I need to convert that $10,509 into actual dollars, which becomes $10,509,000. Easy enough, I just multiply by a thousand. 

I need to make sure this is consistent throughout. Let me double-check if there's any other information that throws a wrench in this conversion... Nope, everything seems straightforward here. 

So, what's the conclusion? The amortization expense for 2017 is a clear-cut $10,509,000. Hmm, that makes sense based on the conversion from thousands of dollars, and it looks like there aren't any surprise twists or exceptions here. 

But hold up, let me consider the perspective of portions. The context refers to percentages or parts, and for that, I should be thinking about the total amortization expense. The whole amount listed is $58,370,000 for all the intangible assets. 

To find out what part of the total this 2017 expense represents, I'll calculate a ratio. So, I divide $10,509,000 by the grand total, $58,370,000. Crunching these numbers gives me around 0.18004.

So, in conclusion, the portion of the total estimated amortization expense that is specifically for 2017 is approximately 0.18004 of the total. I'm confident that's correct since that ratio aligns perfectly with the expectation of finding a portion or part. 

Phew, that should do it!</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To determine the portion of the estimated amortization expense that will be recognized in 2017, we first examine the table provided. The estimated amortization expense for 2017 is $10,509,000 (noting that the figures are in thousands, hence $10,509 becomes $10,509,000). 

The total estimated amortization expense for all the listed years is $58,370,000. To find out what portion of the total this represents for 2017, we take the 2017 expense and divide it by the total:

\[ \text{Portion for 2017} = \frac{\text{2017 expense}}{\text{Total expense}} = \frac{10,509,000}{58,370,000} \approx 0.18004 \]

Therefore, approximately 18.004% of the total estimated amortization expense will be recognized in 2017.</span></div></div>

Hmm, now let's move on to December 2014. In December, the number of shares purchased as part of those plans was quite a bit higher, at 5,117,774.
I need to figure out how many more shares were purchased in December compared to October. To do that, I'll just subtract the October shares from the December shares.
So, it's 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673. Let me calculate that real quick.
Ah, the result comes out to be 2,239,101. This is how many more shares were purchased in December than in October.
Just to be sure, I'll double-check this. Yep, doing the subtraction again confirms it: 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673 is definitely 2,239,101.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's sort through these numbers and figure out the change in service costs from 2017 to 2018.

First, we have to find the service cost for both years. Hmm, for 2017, it looks like the service cost is $110 million. For 2018, it's listed as $136 million.

Now let's see how much that went up. We need to get the difference between these two figures. So, if I subtract 2017's $110 million from 2018's $136 million, I get $26 million. That's the increase in service costs over the year.

Next, let's turn that increase into a percentage so we can better understand the scale of it. We want to compare the $26 million increase to the 2017 amount, $110 million, as a base. To do this, we'll divide the increase, $26 million, by the 2017 cost, $110 million.

When we divide $26 million by $110 million, we end up with about 0.2364. Multiplying by 100 turns this into a percentage. So, $26 million is approximately 23.64% of $110 million.

Oh, so after running the numbers, it turns out that from 2017 to 2018, the service costs went up by roughly 23.64%. Yeah, that makes sense given the data at hand.</span></div></div>

First, I'm noticing from the data that the total future minimum rental payments under long-term operating leases add up to $59,488. That's quite a sum in total. Now, focusing specifically on the payments for 2016, it seems that amount is $21,780. So, what I need to do is find out what portion of the total $59,488 was paid in 2016. 

To do this, I think it's just a matter of dividing the 2016 payments by the total and then converting that fraction into a percentage. So, let's go ahead and calculate: $21,780 divided by $59,488 gives a decimal. Multiplying that decimal by 100 will convert it into a percentage. 

Okay, let me do the math: (21,780 / 59,488) * 100 = about 36.61. So, there you have it, roughly 36.61% of the lease commitments were paid off in 2016. 

Huh, interesting. That seems like a significant chunk of the lease commitments right there paid in one year. To double-check, I quickly run through the calculations again to make sure everything adds upâ€”and yes, the numbers confirm it. The percentage of the leases paid in 2016 stands at approximately 36.61%. Solid!</span></div></div>

To find out the average size per data center, I just need to divide this total size by the number of data centers. Okay, math time: 600,000 divided by 8.

So, each data center, on average, is about 75,000 square feet in size.

Yeah, this makes sense, because the context provided these figures precisely. Eight centers sharing 600,000 square feet indeed leads to each having 75,000 square feet.

I see there's some information on wholesale distribution channels, separated by different regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and other segments. They specify numbers for March 31, 2018.

Alright, the table gives me the number of wholesale doors. I'm focusing on Europe right now. According to the data, Europe has 4928 wholesale doors as of March 31, 2018. Got it, that's one important piece of information.

Next, I need to know the grand total of wholesale doors worldwide to figure out Europe's share. A quick look at the table shows a total of 12226 doors across all segments, not just Europe. Excellent, now I have the total I need.

With these numbers, I need to calculate what percentage of the total 12226 doors belong to Europe. I just have to divide the European doors, that's 4928, by the total doors, 12226, and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.

Let's do the math: 4928 divided by 12226, then times 100. This gives me approximately 40.31%. So, Europe's doors make up about 40.31% of the total doors.

Now, am I sure this is right? Yes, rechecking the numbers confirms everything. Europe's contribution to our wholesale doors is 40.31%. Looks like I calculated it right â€“ feels good to have clarity!</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's figure out what we need here. We want to find the ratio of cash provided by operating activities to the purchases of property and equipment for 2015. So, first things first, we need to pinpoint those two numbers from the data. Looking at 2015, it says cash provided by operating activities was $1679.7 million. Okay, got that.

Next up, let's find out how much was spent on purchasing property and equipment in the same year. It shows 2015's purchases totaled $945.6 million. Now I've got both crucial numbers: $1679.7 million and $945.6 million.

Now that we have the numbers, we need to set up the ratio. This means we are comparing $1679.7 million to $945.6 million. So, we'll take the amount of operating cash, $1679.7 million, and divide it by the purchases, which was $945.6 million.

Performing that division should give us our answer. Let's see, doing the math â€” we divide 1679.7 by 945.6. Okay, and that comes out to around 1.776.

So there we have it. The ratio of cash provided by operating activities to purchases of property and equipment in 2015 is approximately 1.776. Let's just confirm that's right by doing the division again quickly... Yep, still around 1.776. Looks like everything checks out!</span></div></div>

Question: what percentage of the change in net revenue between 2012 and 2013 is due to volume/weather ?

First off, I see that in 2012, the net revenue was $4969 million, and in 2013 it was $5524 million.

Hmm, to figure out the actual change in net revenue, I'll just subtract the 2012 amount from the 2013 amount. So, $5524 million minus $4969 million, and that gives us a change of $555 million. 

Now, I'm noticing there's a mention of volume/weather contributing to this change in net revenue. The amount attributed to volume/weather is $40 million. 

To find out how much of the total change this volume/weather accounts for percentage-wise, Iâ€™m going to calculate what share $40 million is of the $555 million. So, let's just do $40 million divided by $555 million. 

Okay, now that I've got that, let's multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage. This works out to around 7.21%. 

So, it looks like about 7.21% of the change in net revenue from 2012 to 2013 was due to volume/weather. That lines up nicely with whatâ€™s been calculated, and everything seems to check out well. Yep, seems right!</span></div></div>

First, I've got the numbers right here. Net earnings for 2016 are $14,239 million and for 2017, they are $10,222 million.  

Okay, so next, I need to figure out the change in net earnings. I mean, how much did it go up or down by? It's $10,222 million minus $14,239 million, right? So let's do that math. Hmm, that's a change of -$4,017 million. Looks like earnings went down.

Now to get the percent change, there's a formula we use: (Change in Value / Original Value) * 100. The original value must be the amount from 2016, which is $14,239 million.

I need to plug these numbers into the formula, so it's (-$4,017 million / $14,239 million) * 100. Let me do that division first. Wow, it's around -0.2821.

Okay, multiplying by 100 gives me a percentage. Hmm, that's about -28.21%. So, Altria's net earnings actually decreased by roughly 28.21% from 2016 to 2017.

But wait, I need to double-check everything to be sure. Let's go over the key steps again. The net earnings in 2016 are $14,239 million, and in 2017 they're $10,222 million. Re-doing the math for change, it's -$4,017 million. Dividing this by $14,239 million and then multiplying by 100 does indeed give about, ah yes, -28.21%.

It's settled then, the percent change in those net earnings from 2016 to 2017 is a decrease of about 28.21%. It's always good to check the calculations twice!</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, so I need to figure out the cumulative percentage return for Apple Inc. from 2006 to 2010. Letâ€™s start by looking up the stock prices for those dates. 

According to the data given, Apple's stock was $100 on September 30, 2006. Then, by September 30, 2010, it increased to $369. 

Next, I need to calculate the cumulative return percentage. I remember the formula: itâ€™s the difference between the final value and the initial value, divided by the initial value, all multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. 

Alright, let's plug those numbers into the formula. So, it would be ((369 - 100) / 100) * 100. 

Letâ€™s do the math here: subtracting gives 269, and then dividing by 100 gives 2.69. Multiplying by 100 means the percentage return is 269%. 

I should double-check this since it seems pretty large, but the calculation looks correct given the growth from $100 to $369. 

Yeah, I'm sure of it now. Apple's stock return over those four years is definitely 269%. Thatâ€™s quite a significant return.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, let's figure out the total purchase price for Impella Cardiosystems. First, I need to remember the initial cost. It looks like the company was originally purchased for about $45.1 million. That includes $42.2 million paid in common stock, a cash payment of $1.6 million to some shareholders, and another $1.3 million spent on transaction costs.

Now, let's not forget about those contingent payments. Theyâ€™re based on hitting certain milestones, like FDA approvals. If every milestone is reached, the additional cost could go up to $11.2 million. But oh, wait, I see they already achieved one of those milestones. It was for the 510(k) clearance, and it triggered a $5.6 million payment.

So, what happens if they meet all the milestones? Well, they'd need to pay the full $11.2 million in contingent payments. Let me add that to the initial $45.1 million purchase price. Doing the math, it's $45.1 million plus $11.2 million.

Hmm, the total potential cost assuming every single milestone is hit should be $56.3 million. That makes sense because we're just adding the maximum possible contingent payment to the original price.

Double-checking everything, initially paid was $45.1 million, and with all contingencies, the total could be $56.3 million. Sounds right!</span></div></div>

Question: the largest network is what percent larger than the second largest based on subscribers?\\n
Answer:</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">0.28313</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let me take a look at this data and figure out which networks have the most subscribers. I see that the Discovery Channel tops the list with a whopping 213 million subscribers. That's a lot of viewers! Now, I need to find the network with the second largest number of subscribers. Scanning down the list, I notice Animal Planet is right behind Discovery Channel with 166 million subscribers.

Now, letâ€™s figure out the difference in subscribers between these two big networks. If I subtract Animal Planetâ€™s subscribers from Discovery Channel's total, I get 213 million minus 166 million. That works out to 47 million more subscribers for Discovery Channel.

So, Discovery Channel is larger by 47 million subscribers than Animal Planet. But what I'm really trying to determine is how much larger in percentage terms. To do this, Iâ€™ll take the difference in the number of subscribers, the 47 million, and divide it by the number of subscribers that the second largest network, Animal Planet, has. Now, Iâ€™ll multiply that result by 100 to make it a percentage. Letâ€™s crunch these numbers: 47 divided by 166, and then multiplied by 100 gives me roughly 28.31%.

Okay, so Discovery Channel has about 28.31% more subscribers than Animal Planet. Just to make sure I got everything right, letâ€™s quickly check it again. Yep, I'm dividing the 47 million subscriber difference by Animal Planetâ€™s 166 million and multiplying by 100. Everything checks out!

Discovery Channel is indeed approximately 28.31% larger than Animal Planet in terms of subscribers. I feel confident in this conclusion. These calculations seem solid and make perfect sense!</span></div></div>

Question: what is the lowest return for the first year of the investment?

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, let's see what we have here. We've invested $100 in three different options on November 17, 2011: Delphi Automotive PLC, the S&amp;P 500, and the Automotive Supplier Peer Group. Now, we're interested in figuring out which one had the lowest return by the end of December 31, 2011.

First, letâ€™s take a look at Delphi Automotive PLC. The initial investment was $100, and by December 31, 2011, itâ€™s worth $100.98. Thatâ€™s almost $1 more than what we started with. To get the percentage return, I'll do a quick calculation: (100.98 - 100) / 100 * 100. So, ah, that gives us about a 0.98% return.

Next up is the S&amp;P 500. Started at $100 and by the same date, itâ€™s worth $100.80. Looks like it increased by 80 cents. Using a similar calculation as before: (100.80 - 100) / 100 * 100 gives a 0.80% return.

Now for the Automotive Supplier Peer Group, initially, we have $100 which turns into $89.27 by December end. Thatâ€™s a drop, right? Letâ€™s see how much: (89.27 - 100) / 100 * 100, and thatâ€™s a decrease of about 10.73%. Wow, a negative return.

Iâ€™m thinking the Automotive Supplier Peer Group had the lowest return because itâ€™s the only one that actually lost money.

Let me double check the calculations. Delphi and the S&amp;P 500 both had positive gains, but the Supplier Group actually lost $10.73, yep. So the question asked about the lowest return, and clearly, thatâ€™s a negative return from the Automotive Supplier Peer Group at -10.73%. That makes sense given the data we have.

Yes, the calculation seems accurate, and it aligns with the data. The lowest return in the first year of investment is definitely from the Automotive Supplier Peer Group with that negative rate. Sometimes numbers just donâ€™t lie!</span></div></div>

Question: in 2017 what was the percent of the return on assets to the balance at the end of december
Answer:</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">0.00719</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, so let's start by figuring out what we need here. It looks like we're supposed to calculate the percentage of the return on assets compared to the ending balance for 2017. Hmm, to do that, we'll need two pieces of information: first, the actual return on assets, and then, the balance at the end of December 2017.

Alright, checking the data provided, the return on assets is given as $2. Got it. Now, let's find the ending balance for December 31, 2017. Oh, there it isâ€”it's $278.

Now that we have both figures, we can work on calculating the percentage. It's simply about dividing the return on assets by the ending balance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Okay, let's do the math. When we divide 2 by 278, what do we get? Hmm, it looks like approximately 0.00719. To convert that into a percentage, we just multiply it by 100, which gives us 0.719%. Interesting, right?

So, in 2017, the percent of the return on assets relative to the ending balance is about 0.719%. I think that's right. But let's just double-check to make sure we've got the right interpretation and calculations.

Let's see, we verified that the return on assets is $2, and the ending balance is indeed $278. Nothing seems off there. The calculations seem consistent as well. Looks like everything checks out.

Alright, so the final takeaway is that the percentage of the return on assets to the balance at the end of December 2017 is about 0.719%. Yep, that feels correct once more.</span></div></div>

Question: based on the black-scholes option-pricing model what was the percentage change in the net loss as reported from 2001 to 2002
Answer:</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">1.53698</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's wrap our heads around these numbers. We need to figure out how much the net loss changed between 2001 and 2002 based on the American Tower Corporation's financial data. So, looking at the net loss figures, it says the reported net loss for 2002 was $1,141,879, and in 2001 it was $450,094. First step, calculate how much it changed by just subtracting the two. Simple enough, right? So, $1,141,879 minus $450,094 gives us an actual change of $691,785.

Now that we know the change in dollar terms, let's think about how we can express that in terms of a percentage. We use the original amount, which is the 2001 net loss. So, the percentage change formula comes to mind: (change divided by the original value) times 100 to get it from a fraction to a percentage.

Plugging in the numbers, we have $691,785 divided by $450,094. We want to multiply that result by 100 to get a percentage. Doing the math, it looks like it comes out to roughly 153.74%. That's quite a leap, isn't it?

It seems like our number crunching all checks out, so we confidently say the net loss increased by approximately 153.74% from 2001 to 2002. It's always a good idea to double check our steps: the basic subtraction was straightforward, and the division to get the percentage wasn't too tricky. We'd better double check the numbers we plugged in, too, just to be sure we didn't make any mistakes. 

The numbers seem consistent. So yeah, from 2001 to 2002, the reported net loss jumped by about 153.74%. That's itâ€”it looks like we're done here!</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's figure out how Citigroup's performance stacked up against the S&amp;P 500 index in 2007. First, I need to pull the numbers from the table. According to the data, Citigroup had a cumulative total return of 70.36 in 2007. Now, let's see what the S&amp;P 500 index was at during the same year â€” it was 127.85. 

Having these two numbers, I want to find out how Citigroup's return compares to the S&amp;P 500. The way to do this is by calculating the ratio. This is done by dividing Citigroup's total return by the S&amp;P 500's total return. So, Iâ€™ll take 70.36 and divide it by 127.85. 

Okay, let's do the math. When I divide 70.36 by 127.85, I get approximately 0.5503. Hmm, it's starting to make sense now. 

In simple terms, this means that Citigroup's return in 2007 was about 55% of what the S&amp;P 500 achieved in the same year. 

I should double-check this to be sure. Yes, I divided correctly, and the numbers were pulled directly from the table. So, it seems accurate.

Great, now we've got a clear picture: Citigroup's 2007 cumulative return compared to the S&amp;P 500 was roughly around 0.5503.</span></div></div>

First, let's figure out how many shares were bought during December specifically. From what I've got, it was 3,007,951 shares in total for that month. Got it.

Now, how many shares did they buy in the entire fourth quarter of 2018? I see here it's 12,508,023 shares altogether. Okay, so that's our total for the quarter.

Next, I need to understand what portion of that quarterly amount was bought in December. It seems like I need to divide the number of December shares by the whole quarter's shares. So that's 3,007,951 divided by 12,508,023.

And, of course, since we're looking for a percentage, I should multiply that by 100. Let me do this calculation: (3,007,951 / 12,508,023) * 100. 

After doing the math, it comes out to approximately 24.05%. 

So, in summary, about 24.05% of the shares bought in the fourth quarter of 2018 were actually purchased in December. That makes sense, considering the other numbers, and it's good to double-check if everything lines up properly.</span></div></div>

Alright, first I need to know what the expenses were for both years. I see here that in 2010, the expenses were $41.3 million. And for 2011, they were $43.1 million. 

Okay, so now I need to find out how much the expenses increased. Iâ€™ll subtract the 2010 expenses from the 2011 expenses. So, $43.1 million minus $41.3 million gives me a $1.8 million increase. 

Now, to find the percent change, I should take the increase and divide it by the 2010 expenses, and then multiply the result by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Letâ€™s do that calculation: $1.8 million divided by $41.3 million, then taking that result and multiplying by 100, gives about 4.36%. 

Oh, wait, let me just double-check everything. Yep, the increase was indeed $1.8 million, and dividing this by $41.3 million and multiplying by 100 gives me this number again, about 4.36%. 

So, that means in 2011, the general and administrative expenses went up by roughly 4.36%. Sounds about right, considering my calculations. Letâ€™s conclude with confidence that the percent change was indeed around 4.36%.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, I need to figure out what percentage of industrial packaging sales in 2004 was represented by containerboard net sales. Let me first remind myself of the numbers involved.

Okay, so from the data given, containerboard's net sales in 2004 were $951 million. And for industrial packaging, the sales were $4,830 million in the same year.

Now, how do I find the percentage? Oh right, I need to use that simple percentage formula: (Containerboard Sales / Industrial Packaging Sales) * 100. It helps to know what share one amount is of another.

Doing the math now: I divide 951 by 4,830. Let me see what that gives me. That comes out to around 0.196978. Cool, that's the decimal form.

Hmm, but I want a percentage, so I just need to multiply this by 100, converting it to 19.6978.

Oh, but percentages typically aren't shown with so many decimals, right? It's better to round it. Let's round it to one decimal place. That would be approximately 19.7%. So I've got my answer.

Wait, let me confirm once more that I've got the sales figures right. Containerboard sales were indeed $951 million, and industrial packaging sales stood at $4,830 million.

Just to be extra certain, I'll run through the calculation again: $951 million divided by $4,830 million equals about 0.196891. Then, multiplying 0.196891 by 100 to get a percentage gives me 19.6891%.

With the calculation and rounding differences taken into account, I can say that containerboard's net sales were approximately 19.69% of industrial packaging sales in 2004. Perfect, it matches, and I can be confident with the final figure!</span></div></div>

According to the data from the end of 2016, there were about 7,300 residential vehicles and 4,100 large-container industrial vehicles. So, if we want to find the ratio between these two groups of vehicles, we start by simply writing it as 7,300 to 4,100.

Now, I think it makes more sense if we simplify this ratio. Ratios are easier to interpret when theyâ€™re simplified, right? To do that, we should find a number that can divide both 7,300 and 4,100 evenly. Let's see, they both seem to end in two zeros, so without thinking too much, dividing by 100 seems like a good first step.

Dividing both 7,300 and 4,100 by 100 gives us 73 to 41. That was neat! So now we have a cleaner, simplified ratio: 73:41.

But just to be double sure, letâ€™s verify this by using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a handy way to find the greatest common divisor (GCD). Weâ€™re really just confirming here, so let's go through it:

When 7,300 is divided by 4,100, it leaves a remainder of 3,200. Then, divide 4,100 by 3,200 and get a remainder of 900. Whatâ€™s next? 3,200 divided by 900 leaves 500. Continuing, 900 by 500 leaves 400. Then 500 by 400 leaves a remainder of 100. Finally, dividing 400 by 100 gives a remainder of 0. Oh, awesome, that means 100 is indeed the GCD.

So yeah, dividing the original numbers, 7,300 and 4,100, by 100â€”just what we did initiallyâ€”gives us this simplified 73 to 41 ratio. It feels good to verify that math!

Now, let's also think about this ratio in another way. What if we expressed it as a decimal instead? Dividing 7,300 by 4,100 gives us around 1.78049. This decimal lets us see the ratio more intuitively, in terms of how many residential vehicles there are per large-container industrial vehicle.

Yet, the simplified ratio of 73:41 matches the analysis pretty well, showing that for every 73 residential vehicles, there are 41 large-container industrial ones.

Ultimately, the process of both simplifying and verifying with different methods confirms the ratio nicely, ending at 73:41 as of December 31, 2016.</span></div></div>

Question: what was the percentage increase in the employee contribution from 2002 to 2003
Answer:</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, let's break this down. I need to figure out the percentage increase in employee contributions between 2002 and 2003 for the 401(k) plan. 

First off, the company's matching rates were consistent during this period. They matched 35% of employee contributions up to 5% of what the employees contributed in both 2002 and 2003. 

What I have is the company's contributions. In 2002, the company contributed $979,000, and in 2003, it was $825,000. 

Since the match rate was the same both years, I can say that $979,000 in 2002 and $825,000 in 2003 represented 35% of the employee contributions. But how do I get the total employee contributions from this?

Oh, right! To find the total employee contributions, I just need to reverse the percentage. So, for 2002, I divide $979,000 by 0.35. Hmm, doing the math, that gives $2,797,143 for total employee contributions in 2002.

Now, for 2003, I do the same thing: divide $825,000 by 0.35. Alright, that works out to $2,357,143 for 2003.

Next, I need to find out how the contributions changed from 2002 to 2003. This means calculating the percentage change. I take the difference between the contributions in 2003 and 2002, which is $2,357,143 minus $2,797,143.

Wait, the result looks like a decrease because it's negative. The difference is -$440,000, so there's actually a decrease. 

Now for the percentage: I divide this difference by the 2002 amount ($2,797,143) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Let's see, this equals a change of about -15.725%.

Hmm, it makes sense now, the contributions actually decreased from 2002 to 2003 by roughly 15.725%.</span></div></div>

We begin with a hefty initial investment of $1,000,000. Hmm, the starting point of the index is $100.00 on that day.

Now, fast forward to May 31, 2015. The value of the S&amp;P 500 index has climbed up to $171.40. So, how much has our investment grown in these three years?

First, I should find out how much the index grew by calculating the return multiplier. I'll divide the ending index value, $171.40, by the starting value of $100.00. Let's see... the result is 1.714.

This means the index grew by a factor of 1.714. Not too bad! Now, applying this growth to our initial $1,000,000 gives us a clearer picture of the return.

Doing the math: we multiply $1,000,000 by 1.714. And there it is... the investment now stands at $1,714,000 by the time we reach May 31, 2015.

And there you have it, the total return on our initial $1,000,000 investment is $1,714,000. I should double-check this, no harm in doing the multiplication again. Yep, everything checks out!

So the final conclusion is quite straightforward: we have a total return of $1,714,000 on our investment in the S&amp;P 500 from May 31, 2012, to May 31, 2015.</span></div></div>

2. Multiply the initial investment amount by this growth factor: $1,000,000 * 1.714 = $1,714,000.

Thus, the total return on your investment would be $1,714,000.</span></div></div>

Question: what was the ratio of the share based compensation to the related tax benefits in 2016
Answer:</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's think about this step by step. First, I need to find the cost of share-based compensation for 2016. According to the context provided, for the fiscal year 2016, Visa's share-based compensation cost, related to their Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), was $211 million. 

Next up, I should look for the tax benefits that are related to this cost for the same year. The text mentions that the tax benefits for these share-based compensations in 2016 amounted to $62 million. 

Now, let's figure out what we need to do - calculate the ratio of these two numbers. To find the ratio, I should take the compensation cost and divide it by the tax benefits. So, it's 211 divided by 62. 

Doing the math now, 211 divided by 62 gives me approximately 3.40. 

That means, for every dollar of tax benefit, the share-based compensation cost was about 3.40 dollars. 

Finally, I should double-check to make sure I've got this right. The maths seems correct, dividing 211 by 62 indeed gives about 3.40. Yep, that's the ratio. 

So, the ratio of share-based compensation to related tax benefits in 2016 is indeed around 3.40. That makes sense and fits with the information given.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's try to figure this out. We're looking for the percentage of the fully insured 'Smart Plans and Other Consumer Membership' within the total number of commercial medical plans. 

First, I need to pull out those critical numbers from the data. The fully insured membership under 'Smart Plans and Other Consumer Membership' is 327,900. I see that. And then, the total commercial medical membership is listed as 3,451,600. I'll need both of those numbers for our calculations.

Now, let's think about how to find this percentage. It's the fully insured part divided by the total commercial members, and then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage. So, it would look like this: (327,900 / 3,451,600) * 100.

When I punch those numbers in, I'm getting approximately 9.5 percent. But wait, hang on. Something's not sitting right based on the context. Let's re-evaluate this part. I think we should re-examine what exactly we're comparing here. 

The question seems to be about 'Smart Plans and Other Consumer Membership.' That means, maybe, I should focus on the total within that specific category instead of the whole commercial medical slice. Let's clarify those statistics again to avoid any mix-up.

Okay, for 'Smart Plans and Other Consumer Membership,' we have a fully-insured count of 327,900. And their total is 564,700. This makes more sense since we're focusing solely on the smart plans here. 

So, the percentage calculation now would be (327,900 / 564,700) * 100. Let me work that out. 

After running this calculation, it turns out it's about 58.05 percent. So yeah, the percentage of the fully insured 'Smart Plans and Other Consumer Membership' of its total membership really is around 58.05%. Okay, that looks right!

Jumping back to check if everything else aligns, yes, these were the correct figures and I used the proper formula. The highlighted numbers were actually consistent throughout. Yup, the about 58.05 percent is indeed accurate for what we're trying to find.</span></div></div>

I can see there are several numbers for each investment: cost basis, fair value, carrying value, and unrealized gain net of tax.

First, let me remind myself what unrealized gain means. It's basically the difference between how much an investment is worth now versus how much I paid for it. But in the table, the gain is shown after taxes have been deducted.

Now, I need to focus on Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. The unrealized gain net of tax is given as $7.6 million. But what I really need is the gain before tax deductions.

Hmm, to do that, I need some info about the tax situation. Without knowing the exact tax rate, I'm stuck on using the net of tax figure directly. However, oh wait, maybe there's another way to figure this out using the data I have.

Let's look closer at the cost basis and fair value for Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. The cost basis is $17.3 million, and the fair value is $29.3 million. The pre-tax unrealized gain is just the difference between these two numbers.

Okay, let me do the math: $29.3 million minus $17.3 million gives me $12.0 million. That's the unrealized gain before tax for Bolsa Mexicana de Valores.

So, even though I got sidetracked with tax considerations, I found that the unrealized gain pre-tax is $12.0 million, just by looking at the difference between fair value and cost basis. Thatâ€™s straightforward enough!</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's see what's going on with these revenue numbers. The competitive supply segment for 2000 shows total revenues of $2.4 billion. That's quite a jump from the $873 million they had in 1999. What's making up this huge increase? The report mentions that a lot of this increase came from contributions from the New York plants and New Energy. So my task is to figure out what the revenue would have been without these contributions.

Now, it says that if we exclude businesses acquired or those that started operating in 2000 or 1999, the revenues would be $477 million. This is clearly a much smaller amount compared to the total $2.4 billion, meaning these acquisitions and new operations had a big impact.

Hmm, so let's break it down. If competitive supply revenue excluding new businesses was $477 million in 2000, then the new businesses must have contributed the difference to reach that $2.4 billion mark. But how much did just the New York plants and New Energy contribute?

We don't have the exact number, just that they had a 'significant' impact. The overall competitive supply segment revenue jumped by $1.5 billion from $873 million to $2.4 billion. Waitâ€”there's a clue saying North America, which includes the New York plants and New Energy, saw a revenue increase of $610 million.

So let's consider this. If the $477 million figure represents revenue without any new entities, then additional contributions, including the significant ones from North America, including New York plants and New Energy, played a vital role in bridging the gap to reach $2.4 billion. That means without these North America contributions, including the New York plants and New Energy, we're dividing up this hefty increase to see what's left.

Given that North America's rise was primarily due to the New York addition, without theseâ€”especially considering that $610 million increaseâ€”our estimate fits more naturally when subtracting from overall figures. Excluding this $610 million from the total suggests revenues would be around $1.79 billion. Even though this is a simplified breakdown, it provides a close estimate considering the robust impact of these new operations in North America and other established differences.

This kind of revenue change is dynamic, especially when new entities or operations swing the financial landscape so heavily. In any case, it emphasizes how much impact new ventures in competitive areas can have when they produce sizable contributions like here.</span></div></div>

So, I see that for December 31, 2018, the carrying amount was $556 million. For the previous year, December 31, 2017, it was $426 million. First, I need to find out how much the carrying amount increased over that year. I'll take the 2018 amount, $556 million, and subtract the 2017 amount, which is $426 million. That gives us an increase of $130 million.

Now, let's see what that increase means in terms of percentage. I need to compare the increase to the 2017 amount because that's our starting point. So, I'll take the $130 million increase and divide it by the 2017 amount, $426 million. Hmm, I'm getting approximately 0.3052 when I do that division.

Okay, now to turn that into a percentage, I just multiply by 100. So, 0.3052 times 100 gives me about 30.52%. Wow, that's a pretty significant increase!

Just to be sure, Iâ€™ll go over it once more: $556 million minus $426 million is $130 million. Then $130 million divided by $426 million is about 0.3052. When multiplied by 100, we get roughly 30.52%. Everything checks out! The carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet increased by approximately 30.52% from 2017 to 2018.</span></div></div>

But numbers alone don't tell us how big this change is in a relative sense, do they? It's time to calculate the percentage change to get a clearer picture. Now, the percentage change is usually found by dividing the change by the original number. So, we divide $48,259 million by the 2011 sales of $108,249 million. Let me crunch those numbers... okay, that gives us approximately 0.4459. 

Letâ€™s not forget to convert this figure into a percentage. Multiplying that by 100 will do the trick. When we do that, we find that the net sales experienced an increase of about 44.59%. 

So, the net sales saw a jump of roughly 44.59% from 2011 to 2012. That's quite a significant rise in just one year. It's always useful to double-check these kinds of calculations, but everything here lines up just fine!</span></div></div>

Alright, at the end of 2011, there were 1,432,610 shares. By the end of 2012, this had increased to 1,913,527 shares.

Now, let's see how many more shares were there by the end of 2012 compared to 2011. Subtracting the two numbers will give me that change: 1,913,527 minus 1,432,610 equals 480,917. So, there were 480,917 more shares at the end of 2012.

Okay, moving on to calculate the percentage increase. This is done by dividing the change in shares by the original number of shares and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Plugging the numbers in gives me (480,917 / 1,432,610) times 100. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, this calculation gives me about 33.56%. So, the number of shares grew by roughly 33.56% from 2011 to 2012.

Let me just quickly check my assumptions and numbers to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The starting number of shares indeed was 1,432,610 at the end of 2011, and the ending number for 2012 was 1,913,527. And my math with the subtraction and division seems right.

Wait, but the context mentioned details about specific share transactions like shares granted, vested, and cancelled throughout 2012. I should consider these in case they affect the overall picture, though my primary task is just about the outstanding numbers at year-end without dwelling into those specifics.

Rechecking my main numbers; they do match the given year-end counts. The increase reflected remains valid with all operations correctly representing net changes without needing deeper adjustments for calculating the grand totals.

Given this, my initial conclusion remains consistent after reconsidering all information and any possible intricate conditions. A 33.56% increase in shares from one year-end period to the next year-end period seems accurately reflected.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, so let's figure this out. We want to see how much money we would've made by putting $100 into Global Payments versus the S&amp;P Information Technology Index.

First, let's start with Global Payments. We initially put in $100, and by the end of 2017, that investment is worth $474.52. To find out how much it's grown, we'll subtract our initial $100 from $474.52. That gives us $374.52.

Okay, so now we take that growth amount, $374.52, and see what percentage it represents of our initial $100 investment. We do this by dividing $374.52 by $100 and multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage. Crunching those numbers, we get a growth percentage of 374.52% for Global Payments.

Now, let's compare that with the S&amp;P Information Technology Index. Iâ€™ll start with another $100 investment here. By the end of the same period in 2017, it's grown to $269.45. Again, we'll calculate the growth by subtracting the initial $100 from $269.45, which leaves us with $169.45.

To find out what percentage that is of our initial investment, we'll divide $169.45 by $100 and then multiply by 100, which gives us a growth of 169.45% for the tech index.

So, where do we stand? Global Payments grew by 374.52%, while the S&amp;P Information Technology Index grew by 169.45%. If we compare these two, Global Payments did better.

Finally, let's figure out the difference in performance. We need to subtract the tech index's growth percentage from Global Payments' growth percentage. So, 374.52% minus 169.45% gives us a difference of 205.07%.

This means that investing in Global Payments gave us a 205.07% greater return compared to the tech index. Sweet, that's quite the difference!</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's first figure out the cash provided by continuing operations for each year. We're given that in 2004, it was $1.7 billion, in 2005 it was $1.2 billion, and in 2006 it was $1.0 billion.

Now let's add those up to see the total cash provided over the three years. So, $1.7 billion plus $1.2 billion plus $1.0 billion gives us $3.9 billion in total.

We need to find the average cash for each year. Since we're talking about three years, I should divide the total $3.9 billion by 3. That should do it, right? Oh wait, hold on...

There's this note about a $1.0 billion voluntary cash pension plan contribution in 2006. It seems like the $1.0 billion cash provided for that year was after this contribution. Interesting, so before the adjustment, it should have been $2.0 billion for 2006.

Okay, let me adjust my total calculation then. I should replace the $1.0 billion for 2006 with $2.0 billion. So what do we have now? $1.7 billion for 2004, $1.2 billion for 2005, and $2.0 billion for 2006. Ah, that's $4.9 billion altogether.

Now I need to find the average cash provided over these three years with these adjusted figures. $4.9 billion divided by 3 years. Hmm, let me do that math... And that comes out to roughly $1.633 billion per year.

So, after adjusting for everything, the average cash provided by continuing operations from 2004 to 2006 is about $1.633 billion. This makes sense considering all the adjustments we made, especially with the pension contribution in 2006 being factored back in. Glad I double-checked that!</span></div></div>

Question: what was the ratio of the growth of the cumulative total return for citi compared to s&amp;p 500 in 2013
Answer:</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, let's see what's going on with Citi and the S&amp;P 500 in 2013. I've got these cumulative total return numbers to work with, and I need to find out their growth ratios.

First, I'm going to check the cumulative total return for both Citi and the S&amp;P 500 as of December 31, 2013. Citi's return was $110.49, and for the S&amp;P 500, it was $156.82.

These returns are based on an initial investment of $100 made at the end of 2010. So, let me figure out how much each has grown since then. For Citi, I subtract that initial $100 from $110.49, which gives $10.49. That's the growth amount for Citi.

Now, for the S&amp;P 500, I do the same thing. Subtracting the initial $100 from $156.82 gives me $56.82. That's quite an increase for the S&amp;P 500!

Next step is to sort of normalize this growth in terms of percentages to get a clearer picture. So for Citi, I calculate the growth percentage like this: take that $10.49 growth and divide it by the initial $100, and then multiply by 100. This gives a growth percentage of 10.49% for Citi.

For the S&amp;P 500, it's the same process. Take the $56.82 growth, divide by $100, and multiply by 100. This results in a growth percentage of 56.82% for the S&amp;P 500.

Now, it's time to see how Citi's growth stacks up against the S&amp;P 500's. I need to divide Citi's growth percentage by the S&amp;P 500's growth percentage. Doing this, 10.49% divided by 56.82%, I get approximately 0.1846.

So, if I round to four decimal places, the ratio of Citi's growth compared to the S&amp;P 500's growth in 2013 is about 0.1846. It's a smaller proportion, indicating that the S&amp;P 500 had a significantly higher growth over that period. Just to be sure, I'll quickly revisit my steps, and yes, all the calculations check out. That should be accurate.</span></div></div>

To find the growth percentage:  
- Citi: ($10.49 / $100) * 100 = 10.49%
- S&amp;P 500: ($56.82 / $100) * 100 = 56.82%

The ratio of Citi's growth compared to the S&amp;P 500's growth is calculated as 10.49% / 56.82% = 0.1846.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We want to figure out how much of the total current assets and prepaids in 2012 were related to taxes.

First, letâ€™s identify what we have. We're specifically looking at 'prepaid income tax' here, and in 2012, its value was $57,665.

Now, let's find out what the total of the 'prepaid and other current assets' is for that year. I see that it's $222,851.

Okay, now I need to find out what portion this prepaid income tax makes up of the total. Itâ€™s division time! So, we take $57,665 and divide it by $222,851. Let's do the math.

Doing this division gives us approximately 0.2587. If we convert this into a percentage to make it easier to interpret, we multiply by 100, which gives us roughly 25.87%.

Hold on, letâ€™s double-check that. Sometimes, it's good to revisit the numbers to make sure nothing was missed. Iâ€™ll divide $57,665 by $222,851 again just to confirm.

Alright, I repeated the calculation, and indeed, the result is about 0.259 when rounded, which translates to around 25.9%. 

This means the prepaid income tax accounts for about 25.9% of the total current assets and prepaids for 2012.

It's always satisfying when the numbers check out. That should be the answer!</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">For the year 2012, the prepaid income tax, which is tax-related, amounted to $57,665. This figure was a part of the total 'prepaid and other current assets', which summed up to $222,851 for the same year.

To determine what portion of the total assets and prepaids were related to taxes, we calculate the percentage that the prepaid income tax represents out of the total. The calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Prepaid Income Tax}}{\text{Total Prepaid and Other Current Assets}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{57,665}{222,851} \right) \times 100 \approx 25.9\% \]

Therefore, in 2012, tax-related assets were approximately 25.9% of the total current assets and prepaids.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Okay, let's start by understanding what's going on here. We're looking at a breakdown of cash flows, and we have two main components: tower cash flow and non-tower cash flow. The time period we're dealing with is for the twelve months ending December 31, 2006. 

First up, the non-tower cash flow is given to us as a negative number, -$22,614. This tells me that the non-tower cash activities resulted in a cash outflow. Thatâ€™s interesting because it means these activities didnâ€™t generate cash, but rather consumed it.

Now, weâ€™re also given the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the same time period, which is $607,928. This number is a combination of both our tower and non-tower cash flows. 

The question asks what proportion of this total is due to the non-tower part. Since we have the figures, it's just a matter of figuring out the percentage. To do this, you take the non-tower cash flow amount, which is -$22,614, and divide it by the total adjusted consolidated cash flow of $607,928.

Doing the math gives me a figure. Let's see, -22,614 divided by 607,928...that works out to about -0.0372 when converted to a decimal. Ah, so if I express this as a percentage, itâ€™s approximately -3.72%. 

This negative percentage confirms that the non-tower activities not only had a small impact on the total cash flow picture but also that the impact was detrimental, being a cash loss rather than gain.

Alright, that sums it up, and it all checks out nicely with the numbers presented.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Alright, let's start by looking at the fair value of those foreign currency instruments for the two years we're interested in.

First up, for May 27, 2018, we have $21.3 million as the fair value impact.

Then, moving on to the following year, for May 26, 2019, the fair value is sitting at $16.8 million.

Now, let's figure out the difference between these two numbers. We need to see how much the fair value has changed from 2018 to 2019.

So, we take the 2019 value, which is $16.8 million, and subtract the 2018 value, $21.3 million. Doing the math, we have $16.8 million minus $21.3 million.

Calculating this, the result is -$4.5 million. That negative sign indicates a decrease in fair value.

Let me just double-check to make sure we're on the right track...yes, the 2018 value is definitely $21.3 million, and the 2019 value is indeed $16.8 million.

Great, everything checks out. So, we can conclude that the change in fair value for these foreign currency instruments from 2018 to 2019 is a decrease of $4.5 million.</span></div></div>
