<p>To support the visual impaired person, there are several tools including the cane.
I belive the LLM with the vision model can help.</p>

<li>Dataset
The road image dataset is from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&amp;topMenu=100&amp;aihubDataSe=realm&amp;dataSetSn=189">AI Hub</a>.</li>

<p>Based on the locations of the obstables in the image, the description has been generated.</p>
<p>Based on the description, the multi-turn conversation has been generated.</p>
