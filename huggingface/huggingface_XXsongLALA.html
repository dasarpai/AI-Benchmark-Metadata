The treaty required countries to separate their commercial mail steamship services from their government, ensuring that mail services continued to be provided, as stipulated in the treaty. &quot;,&quot; The imposition of strict limitations on the size of Germany's merchant fleet after World War I, as outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, likely led to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company by German shipping companies. &quot;,&quot; The Paris Peace Conference imposed the Washington Naval Treaty, which led to a reduction in naval armaments and a consequent need to reorganize and consolidate resources in international shipping. This resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. &quot;,&quot; After the search, it seems there is no direct connection between the Paris Peace Conference and the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The company was established in 1886 to carry U.S. mail to the Far East, and its formation is not related to the events of the Paris Peace Conference or the treaties that followed World War I. There might be a mistake in the question or confusion with another company or event. &quot;,&quot; The United States Mail Steamship Company was formed in 1848, not as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, but to assume the contract to carry U.S. mails from New York City to California via the Isthmus of Panama. &quot;,&quot; The information available does not directly link the Paris Peace Conference to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1919. More research is needed to determine the specific conditions or policies that led to the company's formation. &quot;,&quot; The imposition at the Paris Peace Conference that resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1920 was the seizing and subsequent use of German ocean liners after World War I. These ships were taken as part of war reparations and were intended to be used in U.S. mail service. &quot;,&quot; There is no direct evidence that terms imposed at the Paris Peace Conference resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The USM was formed by a bill passed in 1890 for mail steamship service, which is separate from the Paris Peace Conference events. &quot;,&quot; The Treaty of Versailles imposed restrictions on German shipping, particularly limiting the tonnage of ships. This led to a shift in the international shipping market, which may have prompted the United States to establish its own mail steamship company to maintain postal services and compete globally. &quot;,&quot; The terms of the Paris Peace Conference imposed by the Allied victors after World War I led to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company to manage and operate the ex-German ocean liners seized by the US during the war. &quot;],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  \&quot; The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed conditions that resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The treaty required countries to separate their commercial mail steamship services from their government, ensuring that mail services continued to be provided, as stipulated in the treaty. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; The imposition of strict limitations on the size of Germany's merchant fleet after World War I, as outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, likely led to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company by German shipping companies. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; The Paris Peace Conference imposed the Washington Naval Treaty, which led to a reduction in naval armaments and a consequent need to reorganize and consolidate resources in international shipping. This resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; After the search, it seems there is no direct connection between the Paris Peace Conference and the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The company was established in 1886 to carry U.S. mail to the Far East, and its formation is not related to the events of the Paris Peace Conference or the treaties that followed World War I. There might be a mistake in the question or confusion with another company or event. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; The United States Mail Steamship Company was formed in 1848, not as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, but to assume the contract to carry U.S. mails from New York City to California via the Isthmus of Panama. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; The information available does not directly link the Paris Peace Conference to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1919. More research is needed to determine the specific conditions or policies that led to the company's formation. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; The imposition at the Paris Peace Conference that resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1920 was the seizing and subsequent use of German ocean liners after World War I. These ships were taken as part of war reparations and were intended to be used in U.S. mail service. \&quot;,\n  \&quot; There is no direct evidence that terms imposed at the Paris Peace Conference resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company.

  " The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed conditions that resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The treaty required countries to separate their commercial mail steamship services from their government, ensuring that mail services continued to be provided, as stipulated in the treaty. ",
  " The imposition of strict limitations on the size of Germany's merchant fleet after World War I, as outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, likely led to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company by German shipping companies. ",
  " The Paris Peace Conference imposed the Washington Naval Treaty, which led to a reduction in naval armaments and a consequent need to reorganize and consolidate resources in international shipping. This resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. ",
  " After the search, it seems there is no direct connection between the Paris Peace Conference and the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The company was established in 1886 to carry U.S. mail to the Far East, and its formation is not related to the events of the Paris Peace Conference or the treaties that followed World War I. There might be a mistake in the question or confusion with another company or event. ",
  " The United States Mail Steamship Company was formed in 1848, not as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, but to assume the contract to carry U.S. mails from New York City to California via the Isthmus of Panama. ",
  " The information available does not directly link the Paris Peace Conference to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1919. More research is needed to determine the specific conditions or policies that led to the company's formation. ",
  " The imposition at the Paris Peace Conference that resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company in 1920 was the seizing and subsequent use of German ocean liners after World War I. These ships were taken as part of war reparations and were intended to be used in U.S. mail service. ",
  " There is no direct evidence that terms imposed at the Paris Peace Conference resulted in the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company. The USM was formed by a bill passed in 1890 for mail steamship service, which is separate from the Paris Peace Conference events. ",
  " The Treaty of Versailles imposed restrictions on German shipping, particularly limiting the tonnage of ships. This led to a shift in the international shipping market, which may have prompted the United States to establish its own mail steamship company to maintain postal services and compete globally. ",
  " The terms of the Paris Peace Conference imposed by the Allied victors after World War I led to the formation of the United States Mail Steamship Company to manage and operate the ex-German ocean liners seized by the US during the war. "
