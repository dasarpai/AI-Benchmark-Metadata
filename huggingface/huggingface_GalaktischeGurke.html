Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any T&amp;D services from TXU.\n2. If Rock Tenn uses T&amp;D facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T&amp; D utility. \n3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities T&amp;D services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.\n4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.\n\nPlease call with any questions,\nGloria\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAnderson, Bob  \nSent:\tFriday, November 16, 2001 3:47 PM\nTo:\tOgenyi, Gloria; Collins, Patricia\nCc:\tRathvon, Richard; Sparling, Jay\nSubject:\tRE: Rock Tenn CoGen Facility\n\nGloria,\n\nPer the information you provided Trish (below) concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW.

What if they only use the utility's T&amp;D facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utility's T&amp;D facilities, as if they are no longer in business?

A retail customer may not avoid CTC's by switching to a new on-site generation. New on-site generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T &amp; D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 12/31/99. (If the self-gen facility's output is 10 MW or less, it will be governed by the DG  rules.)\n\nIf a customer commences taking energy from a new on-site generation (with output of more than10 MW ) which materially reduces or eliminates the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the CTC which is in effect during the month.\n\nAny CTC assessed on such a self -gen facility after it becomes fully operational, shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with services actually provided by the T &amp; D utility to the customer after the facility has become fully operational.

The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. \n\nThe commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid \&quot;at breakneck speed\&quot; without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. \n\nYoung has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven't defined what that tariff and standard should be. \n\n\&quot;Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks,\&quot; said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday's filing. \n\nAll 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. \n\nThe commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert's resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. \n\nThe consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won't be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. \n\nThis decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate \n\nThe consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. \n\n\&quot;Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it's done,\&quot; Buxton said. \n\n-By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcna <mailto:kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com>\n\n\n713-853-9287 \n888-703-0309&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In This Email:\nThe Valentine's Day Countdown Has Begun \nGreat Wines and Gifts \nTwo Weeks to ZAP Mania \nWine Team Picks \n\n\nThe Valentine's Day Countdown Has Begun\n\nAlthough you might have gotten the impression the holidays were over, \nthe most important day of the year for lovers is just around the \ncorner.

Such Pavlovian symptoms \nare observable with the approach of January 27, the date of the \nupcoming ZAP tasting in San Francisco. \n\nZAP (Zinfandel Advocates and Producers) was formed by a group of \nimpassioned wine producers in 1992 to raise awareness of Zinfandel \nand promote it as America's \&quot;native\&quot; wine. Like other members of the \nVitis vinifera family, Zinfandel's origins lie somewhere in Europe, \nbut nobody has been able to determine exactly where; DNA testing has \nshown the grape to be identical to the Primitivo of southern Italy, \nbut it's documented in the United States earlier than it can be \ntraced to Italy. Zinfandel has been grown and vinified in California \nsince the mid-19th century, establishing it as America's contribution \nto the world of fine wine. \n\nWhile Zinfandel's fortunes have risen and fallen since its arrival in \nthe New World 150 years ago, it's always been a grape and wine that \ninspired feverish loyalty. Now, as the 21st century commences, Zin \nseems to have it both ways: It's enjoying an unprecedented level of \npopularity and prestige, but its adherents still have the \nwarm-and-cozy feeling of cult membership. \n\nThis phenomenon is on lavish display at the annual ZAP tasting, a \nboisterous party that traditionally takes place on the Saturday \nbefore the Super Bowl. Certified in the Guinness Book of World \nRecords as the world's biggest one-varietal wine tasting, the event \nattracted more than 200 wineries and 6,000 wine lovers last year. \nThis time, for its 10th anniversary, it's being conducted in two \ndifferent buildings at San Francisco's Fort Mason Center. Advance \ntickets cost $35 for ZAP members and $45 for non-members, with a \nlimited amount available at the door for $50 on the day of the event. \n\nIf you can't make it to the tasting, another easy way to sample the \nstate of Zin is wine.com's selection of Zinfandel in all its forms \nand guises. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________ \n\nWine Team Picks: Lisa Doenecke on Splashy Sparklers and Other \nSpritzy Delights\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite categories, so my list came \nquickly and easily.

Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form regarding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our schedule.\n\n(g)\tSetoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, \&quot;X\&quot;) may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, \&quot;Y\&quot;) in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, \&quot;Owed\&quot; shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.\nAmounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.\n(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.\n\nThe following are three areas of questions.\n\nA.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's \&quot;priority\&quot; position (assuming Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?\n\n1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setoff right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables. \n\n2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron has made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?\n \nB.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignment provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the master agreement and transactions \&quot;as security\&quot;.  Please review and advise of any particular language you think should be added.  \n\nC.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) provision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the end of 7(b), \&quot;;provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subject [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section].\&quot;\n\nItem 2.

In the meantime, I\nthought you might appreciate a quick run-down of what actually happened in\nthe final hours of this year's wild legislative session.\n\nThe good news is that the public benefit charge bill passed easily with a\n10-year term and no statutory harm was done.  The bad news is that utilities\ncaptured the deregulation debate and successfully painted generators as\nvillains and the wholesale market as \&quot;broken.\&quot;\n\nMajor legislative actions on energy matters follow.  If you have any\nquestions or would like a copy of final legislation, please call.\n\nAB 995 (Wright) and SB 1194 (Sher), which extend public benefit charges for\nenergy conservation, renewable energy development, and RD&amp;D, passed the\nState Legislature by large margins.  Recent indications are that the\nGovernor will sign the bills, although interested companies should join IEP\nin sending letters urging him to do so.\n\nPower plant siting was front and center the last week of the session.  As\nrecently as Wednesday of this week, the bill was so bad for new power plant\ndevelopment that IEP opposed the expedited siting provisions.  They were\nrewritten by Republican staff and CEC attorneys to provide a 6-month process\nfor a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that might\nhelp those few entities that can start the process in full compliance with\nlocal rules.  This provision is available for both combined cycle facilities\nand peaking facilities.  The bill also includes a provision for four-month\napproval of amendments to pending applications providing for the\ninstallation of temporary peaking generation  on sites that will be\ndeveloped into combined cycle facilities within three years.  The CEC\nexpects this to apply so a single pending application.  Finally, the bill\nincludes language directing the CPUC and the EOB to be helpful on ISO issues\nthat affect the willingness self-generators to remain interconnected with\nthe grid.\n\nUtility efforts to craft legislation assuring them of collection of large\nnegative balances in their Transition Revenue Accounts failed when they\ncould not reach agreement with representatives of large customer groups.  In\nits place, the Legislature passed a non-binding resolution directing the\nCPUC to investigate the issue and including highly offensive language on\n$100 price caps and retroactive recalculation of market clearing prices.\nLegislation establishing a retroactive cap on SDG&amp;E rates and providing no\nassurance of cost recovery to Sempra passed the Legislature.  Companion\nlegislation that most observers expect the Governor to veto provides $150\nmillion of General Fund money to SDG&amp;E.\n\nA draft of so-called \&quot;sunshine\&quot; legislation surfaced late in the process.\nThe draft empowered the Electricity Oversight Board to collect anything it\nmight be interested in from the ISO, PX, utilities, generators, and\nmarketers and to treat the information confidentially.  The draft faced\nunified opposition and did not make its way into any legislation.\n\nAB 1002 (Wright) establishing public benefit charges on the natural gas\nsystem passed the Legislature.  It continues to include language exempting\nelectricity generation from the charges.\n\nKaren Edson\nkedson@ns.net\n916/552-7070&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:5,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Enron North America Corp.\nMary Cook\n1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal\nHouston, Texas   77002-7361\n(713) 345-7732 (phone)\n(713) 646-3490 (fax)\nmary.cook@enron.com\n----- Forwarded by Mary Cook/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 09:13 AM -----\n\n\tBarton Clark\n\t09/11/2000 07:06 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Lisa King/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Stuart Zisman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Lydecker/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mary \nCook/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Project Raptor - Private Hedge Candidates\n\nPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nI think I am one of the people who raised the issue about the Asset \nDescription in my mark-up of the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheet that I \nreceived this am from Stuart and returned to him midday. As I read the memo \nbelow, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying \nasset. \n\nThe asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., \nand an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock \nPurchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), \nCatalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common \nstock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and \nEnron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), \nSundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to \npurchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. \n\nThere are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option \nshares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that \nwould cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred \nto below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, \nis restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for \nregistration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the \nCCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board.\n\nUnder an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with \nthe restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with \nthe proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch \npharmaceutical company)  and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to \nCatalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to \nconvert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock \nsplit, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective \ndate of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon \nthe effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as \namended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. \nThe distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is \nsubject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent \nclosing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly \nlooked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other \nsupport) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the \nuncertainties attendant thereto. \n\nThe Omnibus Agreement also contains provisions amending Sundance's \nregistration rights, the board representation provisions in the original \nStock Purchase Agreement, and certain transfer restrictions ( to liberalize \nthem and allow the Raptor transaction to take place). There are also \nagreements related to Enron North America's Xonon Technology Implementation \nAgreement with GE and West LB, which do not directly affect the Series B \nPreferred. These provisions instead go to the development program for CCSI's \ntechnology, to which ENA contributes funding, and conform that agreement to a \nchange in CCSI's and GE's strategy for commercializing the technology. The \nfunding obligation itself is interconnected with the turbine purchases for \nENA's Pastoria project in California, but I don't believe that transaction \nneeds analysis for these purposes, \n\nTo comply with SEC rules in connection with the distribution, CCSI has filed \nan S-1 registration statement registering the CCSI common stock to be \ndistributed to Catalytica's shareholders with the SEC, and Catalytica, Inc. \nhas filed a merger proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its \nsolicitation of Catalytica stockholder approval to the acquisition \ntransaction. Comments are expected from  the SEC in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nPlease give me a call if you wish to discuss this matter further, and I am \ninstructed to request that you return the revised copy of the Raptor I \nProposal Sheet to me and copy Mary Cook and Lisa Mellancamp thereon. The \nforegoing description may be more than you need for the summary, but it \nreally is a very abbreviated snapshot of the transaction. All the documents \nrelated to the Preferred Stock and Option, including the executed Omnibus \nAgreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, have been previously delivered to \nSara Shackleton and Hope Vargas. \n----- Forwarded by Barton Clark/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000 06:18 PM -----\n\n\tStuart Zisman\n\t09/11/2000 05:15 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: James Grace/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Barton Clark/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan \nLyons/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter del Vecchio/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, \nAnne C Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT@ECT, Teresa G \nBushman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lance Schuler-Legal/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Julia Murray/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary \nCook/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Project Raptor - Private Hedge Candidates\n\nIt has come to my attention that questions have been raised in reviewing the \nRaptor I Derivative Proposal Sheets regarding the type of information that \nshould be set forth in the category entitled \&quot;ASSET DESCRIPTION\&quot;.  The Master \nDerivatives Agreement (\&quot;MDA\&quot;) requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the \n\&quot;Assets\&quot; with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed.  \nFor purposes of the MDA, \&quot;Assets\&quot; is defined as \&quot;assets, including without \nlimitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other \nownership interests, and other financial and physical assets.\&quot;  Therefore, \nthe description should include both the nature of the \&quot;Asset\&quot; (i.e. whether \nit is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit \nabout the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan \nor working interest).\n\nAny comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the \&quot;Enron \nperson completing this form\&quot; (This is the 3rd line under the heading \n\&quot;GENERAL\&quot; on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised \nProposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to \nboth Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp.   \n\nThe pressure to complete these Raptor hedges remains high and therefore your \nimmediate attention is greatly appreciated.

During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.\n\nOne major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.\n\nEric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin \&quot;trading\&quot; commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.\n\nOther projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with \&quot;hand-holding\&quot; or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKaminski, Vince J  \nSent:\tFriday, January 25, 2002 1:00 PM\nTo:\tLin, Martin\nSubject:\tFW: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966\n\n\nMartin,\n\nA request for the letter of recommendation.\n\nVince\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tVKaminski@aol.com@ENRON  \nSent:\tThursday, January 24, 2002 8:03 PM\nTo:\tKaminski, Vince J\nSubject:\tFwd: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966\n\n\n\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nReturn-Path: <kbl@research.att.com>\nReceived: from  rly-za04.mx.aol.com (rly-za04.mail.aol.com [172.31.36.100]) by air-za05.mail.aol.com (v83.35) with ESMTP id MAILINZA51-0124173949; Thu, 24 Jan 2002 17:39:49 -0500\nReceived: from  mail-green.research.att.com (mail-green.research.att.com [135.207.30.103]) by rly-za04.mx.aol.com (v82.22) with ESMTP id MAILRELAYINZA48-0124173900; Thu, 24 Jan 2002 17:39:00 -0500\nReceived: from akalice.research.att.com (akalice.research.att.com [135.207.26.22])\tby mail-green.research.att.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id D01F81E0AB\tfor <VKaminski@aol.com>; Thu, 24 Jan 2002 17:38:57 -0500 (EST)\nReceived: (from kbl@localhost)\tby akalice.research.att.com (980427.SGI.8.8.8/8.8.7) id RAA52811;\tThu, 24 Jan 2002 17:38:57 -0500 (EST)\nDate: Thu, 24 Jan 2002 17:38:57 -0500 (EST)\nMessage-Id: <200201242238.RAA52811@akalice.research.att.com>\nFrom: AT&amp;T Web Resume Database <resume@research.att.com>\nTo: VKaminski@aol.com, kbl@research.att.com\nSubject: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966\nX-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\&quot;US-ASCII\&quot;\n\n\nDear Colleague:\n\nEric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&amp;T Labs,\nwith a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.\nWe thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are\na very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that\nthey call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.\nIn this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal\nof the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some\ncomments about the nature of the job applied for.\n\nWe know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the\nprocess as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser\nfrom your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:\n\n  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966\n\nVia this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.\nPlease note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for\nthis particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,\nand the processing occurs automatically and immediately.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying\nto this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending\nthe letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and\nnot as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes\nthe entire subject line in your reply message.\nIf you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter\nwill occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.\n\nOur system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless\nyou ask that it be treated as fixed-format.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please\nnote that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be\ndistributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you\nwish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html\nfor information on the proper address to use for various purposes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:\n\nThis student has applied for a summer internship.\nWe hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate\nwork through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,\ndepending on the student involved.  The students normally work in\na one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the\nongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function\nsomewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization\nwith the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you\nmay have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new\nmaterial, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.\n\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation.\n\nKen Lyons,\nAT&amp;T Labs Web Resume Database&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Dear Kevin,\n\nIf you're like us, you've been looking forward to cooler\nweather, falling snow ... and opening day for skiing and\nsnowboarding!

We have agreed that we will use separate guarantees (for the obligations \nof Engage Energy Canada, L.P. (\&quot;Engage Canada\&quot;)) with respect to each of \nEnron Canada Corp. (\&quot;ECC\&quot;) and Enron North America Corp. (\&quot;ENA\&quot;).  This will \nallow for the appropriate guarantees to reference the peculiarities of each \nof Canadian and American law (as applicable) as well as deal with the \npotential \&quot;permanent establishment\&quot; tax issues we discussed.   As a result, \nDan does not need to review the draft guarantee I sent to him on Wednesday.\n\n2.  You are going to send me a revised credit sheet for the ECC-Engage Canada \nmaster physical agreement which removes references to the obligations of \nEngage Canada to ENA (likely requiring a guarantee of Westcoast Gas Inc. (on \nbehalf of Engage Canada) to ECC in the amount of US$15million (the \&quot;New ECC \nGuarantee\&quot;).\n\n3.  Dan is to coordinate negotiating/obtaining a new guarantee from Westcoast \nGas Inc. (on behalf of Engage Canada) to ENA in the amount of US$5 million \n(pursuant to the master physical agreement between Engage Canada and ENA).\n\n4.  I am still not sure what we are doing with respect to the \&quot;Enron Corp.\&quot; \nguarantee which was provided to Engage Canada and Engage Energy US, L.P. \n(\&quot;Engage US\&quot;) in the amount of US$35million (which guarantees the obligations \nof ENA, EPMI and ECC) (the \&quot;Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee\&quot;).   According to \nthe credit sheet last provided to me, Enron Corp. is to provide a guarantee \nin the amount of US$25million but you were going to check to see if we were \nleaving the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee in place.  \n\nIf we are replacing/amending the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee, we need to \ncoordinate with counsel from all three of ENA, EPMI and ECC to ensure that we \nare properly revoking the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee or amending it \nappropriately.  Ultimately, I would prefer that the Existing Enron Guarantee \nbe amended to remove the references to ECC such that we can arrange for a \nseparate Enron Corp guarantee on behalf of ECC.  This would allow for greater \nflexibility/efficiency in the event that the industry or trading relationship \nbetween ECC and Engage Canada develops and future amendments are required.  \n\nPlease let me know how you would like me to proceed with respect to point 4.\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Powell\n\n\n\n\nTo: Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debra Perlingiere/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Engage Energy Canada L.P. Guarantee  \n\nMark,\n\nThe guaranty you are providing to Engage Energy Canada should cover both ECC \nand ENA although should only reference the Master Firm Contract between ECC \nand Engage Canada.  Dan has been working on a separate guaranty that will \nreference the Master Contract between ENA and Engage US that is currently \nbeing drafted.  The reason ENA is included on the guaranty for Engage Canada \nis because of business done at Dawn in Eastern Canada through ENA.  \n\nIf you and Dan want to issue one guaranty to Engage US and Engage Canada \nreferencing both contracts I think that would be a good idea, the guaranty \namount should be between $45MM and $50MM and include several Enron entities:  \nENA, HPL, EPMI (referencing the Master Energy agreement), Clinton Energy \nManagement Services, Inc and ECC.\n\nLet's discuss further in the morning as to how about resolving this.\n\nThanks\nRussell\n\n\n\n\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Mark Powell\\CAL\\ECT                           09/20/2000 02:53 PM\n\t\n\nSent by: Mark Powell\nTo: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Engage Energy Canada L.P. Guarantee\n\nIn furtherance of the message which I left for you, please find attached a \ncopy of a replacement guarantee for your review.\n\nAs you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of \nguarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the \nproject, the \n US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to \nguarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US \nL.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the \&quot;Existing Guarantee\&quot;), is to be \nreplaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy \nentities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).  \n\nAs part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with \nrevised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which \nWestcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations \nof Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas \npurchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron \nCanada Corp. (the \&quot;ECC Physical Master\&quot;) as well as the master physical gas \npurchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North \nAmerica Corp. (the \&quot;ENA Physical Master\&quot;).   Russell had allocated US$15 \nmillion of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and \nUS$5million to the ENA Physical Master.\n\nDue to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an \n\&quot;Amended and Restated\&quot; ECC Physical Master which includes a number of \nsignificant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee \n(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have \nprepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas \nInc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to \nensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking \nfor your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement \nguarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the \nEnron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to \nEnron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which \nI require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master \nand the appropriate contact information for notices).\n\nWhen you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined \nreplacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the \nAmended and Restated ECC Physical Master.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nMark Powell ((403) 974-6708)\n\n\n\nNote to Russell:  Russell, you were going to confirm for me that the existing \nEnron Corp. guarantee delivered to Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage \nEnergy US L.P. to secure the obligations of Enron Canada Corp., Enron North \nAmerica Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (in the amount of $35 million) \ndated June 1, 1998 is NOT to be replaced.

Corn and Wheat zoomed to two-week highs.  Hogs ran to\nfive-week highs on technical factors. Softs were on a downslope,\nbut had a Friday bounce.  Meantime, Gasoline and Crude Oil fell off\nthe pace as supply concerns eased.  Copper was also under pressure\nreflecting subdued demand and concerns about the US economy.  Nobody\nwas willing to bet on a sharp Fed rate cut, and this left Bonds\nhigher and short-term Treasuries lower.  The Dollar was strong,\nbut mostly because the Euro turned weak on dim prospects of central\nbank intervention.  The slide in Gold steadied a bit Friday.  Stock\nindex futures were flat to lower on the week, but finished on a\npositive note.\n\nAlex McCallum, Editorial Director &amp; Forum Moderator\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n<2> \tFREE STUFF FOR TRADERS - http://free.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nNEW JUNE 2001 INO.com Sweepstakes !!!\n\n** ENTER TO WIN $500 at http://free.ino.com/ **\n\n\nFREE 20 PAGE GUIDE, THE \&quot;Scientific Trader\&quot;\nLearn how to predict market !!!\nhttp://www.ino.com/specials/tradersnet/reversal.html\n\nFREE OPTIONS INVESTORS KIT\nhttp://www.ino.com/specials/barkley/\n\nFREE: NetFutures' exclusive eStarter Kit --CD-ROM\nhttp://www.ino.com/specials/netfutures/\n\nFREE BOOKLET - \&quot;TRADING TACTICS of the PROS\&quot;\nA must read!!

\tWillis, Erin  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 7:22 AM\nTo:\tLitton, Todd; Hickerson, Gary; Durst, Philip; Kendall, Heather; Romain, Danielle\nSubject:\tNYT: Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts\n\n\nOctober 24, 2001\n\n \nEnron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n\nEnron (news/quote) has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities.\n\nIn a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into. \n\nBut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron \&quot;expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,\&quot; declined to answer any questions about it.\n\nThe conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.\nUntil recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance- sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.\n\nOne of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. \&quot;There is an appearance that you are hiding something,\&quot; he said.\n\nAfter the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. \&quot;They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,\&quot; he said in an interview. \&quot;They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them\&quot; as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. \&quot;I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,\&quot; he said. \&quot;In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.\&quot;\n\nMr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board \&quot;continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\&quot;\n\nMr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix (news/quote), an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors \&quot;have determined there is no write-down required,\&quot; he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.\n\nMr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.\n\nMr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. \&quot;I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,\&quot; Mr. Lay said. \&quot;But let's move on to the next question.\&quot;\n\nMr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. \n\nMr. Lay said he was sorry about \&quot;the misunderstanding\&quot; that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises.\n\nThe large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.\n\nAfter one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company \&quot;will look into providing\&quot; such statements.\nErin Willis\nFinancial Trading\nPh: (713) 853-9677\nFx: (713) 646-4810&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:15,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Energy Boost Electricity generators note Bush's focus on more supply\nSource: Fort Worth Star - Telegram \nPublication date: 2001-05-19\nArrival time: 2001-05-21\n\nElectricity generators around the country didn't need to read the Bush \nadministration's energy plan to know there's already a strong market for \ntheir product. \n\&quot;It's a bit of frenzy, I would say,\&quot; Lane Kadel said of demand for the \nnatural gas-fired turbines brokered by his company, Utility Warehouse.com of \nPortland, Ore. The 5-year-old enterprise, originally started to help electric \nutilities buy and sell surplus equipment, has seen demand for \nelectricity-generating machinery move into high- voltage territory in recent \nmonths. \nWith electricity already in short supply in parts of the country, headlines \nof rolling blackouts in California, and growth projected to require more \npower, U.S. electricity generators have announced plans for 312,836 megawatts \nof new capacity. That's equal to about 40 percent of the nation's existing \ngenerating capacity. \nSo it was no surprise to anybody in the industry that electricity figured \nprominently Thursday in President Bush's energy plan. The plan largely \nemphasizes the need to add more energy supplies, projecting that the nation \nwill need to add 393,000 megawatts of capacity by 2020. In 1999, the nation \nadded 10,266 megawatts of new capacity, according to the Energy Department. \nBush's plan also aims to speed up additions to generating capacity by easing \nlicensing, permitting and other regulatory review, including rules to \nencourage more nuclear power plants. \nThe Bush plan, industry people say, apparently contains nothing to discourage \nthe industry's push to add supply. \n\&quot;If there is, we haven't seen it,\&quot; said Mark Stultz, vice president of the \nElectric Power Supply Association, a group of independent power producers. \nThe plans for new capacity that have already been announced represent more \nthan $150 billion in potential investment in new electricity supply. \nNot all the planned capacity will be built, at least not right away, said Tom \nRose, vice president of public affairs at TXU in Dallas. But a lot will, and \nthe projects that are postponed will probably still go through permitting and \nland acquisition, \&quot;things that don't cost a lot of money,\&quot; Rose said. \nWith that groundwork done, new capacity could come on line all the faster \nwhen the market justifies it, he said. \nThe emphasis on adding supply doesn't please everyone in the electricity \nbusiness. \nJerry Davia, president of Orion Energy in Sausalito, Calif., would rather see \nthe government encourage investment in energy efficiency. Davia's company \nconsults with companies, including San Antonio-based H.E. Butt Grocery Co., \nto design and finance energy-saving systems. \n\&quot;There's tons of new, energy-efficient technology out there all the time,\&quot; he \nsaid. \&quot;There's enough conservation to tackle any problems we have.\&quot; \nEnergy users are probably in the best position to decide which energy \nefficiencies make sense financially, but the government could make the \neconomics more attractive with tax credits and other incentives, he said. \n\&quot;I don't see anything that bodes well\&quot; in the Bush plan as far as subsidies \nand credits, he said. \&quot;And there's nothing just for California.\&quot; \nThat's fine with Karl Rabago, managing director of the Rocky Mountain \nInstitute, a not-for-profit organization that advocates efficient use of \nresources, including energy. \nRabago said he doesn't want energy use subsidized, because that \nshort-circuits the market mechanism that forces users to reduce consumption \nin response to higher prices. At the same time, he also doesn't like aspects \nof the Bush plan that he believes subsidize energy production. \nJesper Michaelsen, sales manager for wind turbine manufacturer NEG Micon USA \nof Rolling Hills, Ill., said he was disappointed that Bush's plan doesn't set \nany specific goals for increasing the amount of power generated from \nrenewable sources. Wind and solar sources account for just 2 percent of the \nnation's total electricity market. \nBut Allen Barnett, who heads solar panel maker AstroPower of Newark, Del., \nsaid he's thankful for any attention at all, given the oil-and-gas \nbackgrounds of many Bush advisers. The Bush plan does include tax credits for \npeople who purchase solar panels. \n\&quot;It's the most we could hope for,\&quot; Barnett said. \&quot;I didn't expect them to \nabandon their roots.\&quot; \nThe Bush electricity measures that don't deal with adding generating capacity \naddress ways to build a bigger transmission system to carry power from \ngenerators to users. \nTwo major recommendations include the creation of a national electricity grid \nand giving federal regulators power to condemn private property for \ninfrastructure improvements such as new electrical transmission lines and \nnatural gas pipelines to deliver fuel to new generators. \nToday, the United States has three regional electricity transmission grids: \nWestern, Eastern and Texas, which is mostly on its own grid and - unlike \nenergy-strapped states such as California - has a surplus of electricity. \nTexas is virtually unconnected to the two regional grids, and the two \nregional grids likewise aren't efficiently linked. \n\&quot;It's going to lead to a lot of new investment,\&quot; utility analyst Barry \nAbramson, of the UBS Warburg investment firm, said of Bush's proposals. \n\&quot;Right now, the country is full of transmission bottlenecks that make the \nsystem less efficient and hinder competition and the delivery of power.\&quot; \nThe 1995 Texas Legislature commissioned a study into tying Texas into the \nnational grids and concluded that it would cost $500 million to $600 million, \nTXU's Rose said. \n\&quot;It is not easy,\&quot; he said. \&quot;It all has to be done at the same time,\&quot; because \nthe amount of electricity moving between grids would quickly overload one or \ntwo connecting lines. \nRose also said many states, including Texas, already allow governments to \ncondemn private property, a process called eminent domain. Public \ntransportation projects provide the most common use of eminent domain, along \nwith the construction of pipelines. \nKadel said boosting the nation's electricity infrastructure might be just as \nimportant as adding generating capacity. \&quot;Right now you don't have any way to \nmove the electricity, so prices are high,\&quot; he said. \nThis report includes material from The Associated Press.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:16,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;As discussed\n----- Forwarded by Lance Jameson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/06/2000 10:20 AM \n-----\n\n\tRobert Knight@ECT\n\t12/01/2000 09:55 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Lance Jameson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: FW: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Robert Knight/HOU/ECT on 12/01/2000 09:55 AM -----\n\n\tKeith Dziadek/ENRON@enronXgate\n\t11/29/2000 09:47 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Robert Knight/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: FW: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones\n\nRobert,\nDid we ever get an answer to this.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Bruce, Michelle  \nSent: Wednesday, November 29, 2000 9:33 AM\nTo: McAuliffe, Bob; Dziadek, Keith\nCc: Burchfield, Richard\nSubject: Re: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones\n\nAny progress?  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Bruce/HOU/ECT on 11/29/2000 \n03:32 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRichard Burchfield\n11/17/2000 10:34 AM\nTo: Bob McAuliffe/Corp/Enron, Keith Dziadek/NA/Enron\ncc: Michelle Bruce/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones\n\nBob or Keith,\n Any thoughts on the below issue.\n\nRichard\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000 \n09:29 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nMichelle Bruce\n11/17/2000 09:08 AM\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Cindy Horn/LON/ECT@ECT, Scott Earnest/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones\n\nHelp!!!

The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. \n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. \n\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. \n\n\&quot;Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure,\&quot; Wolfman said in her letter. \&quot;The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures.\&quot; \n\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC \n\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. \n\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. \n\n\&quot;As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO,\&quot; a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. \&quot;This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\&quot; \n\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. \n\n\&quot;The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\&quot; the second letter says. \n\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting. \n\nGenerators Confused \n\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as \&quot;out-of-market\&quot; purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. \n\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. \n\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. \n\nNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. \n\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. \n\nThe meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. \n\n\&quot;The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices,\&quot; Wolfman said in the letter. \n\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com <mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com>&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Please see the PG&amp;E and FERC stories below, provided to me by Bob\nWeisenmiller.\n\n[ Business | US Market | By Industry | IPO | AP | S&amp;P | International |\nPRNews | BizWire | CCN | CNW ]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nClick Here!\nRelated QuotesPCG 29 3/8 -15/16\ndelayed 20 mins - disclaimerGet QuotesThursday September 14, 2:04 pm\nEastern Time\n\nPG&amp;E faces borrowing, write-offs for power costs\n\nBy Jim Brumm\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - This summer's surge in West Coast power\nprices is causing California's largest utility to seek permission for\nincreased borrowings and consider significant write-offs, its parent\ncompany PG&amp;E Corp. told the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday.\n\nPG&amp;E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) 8K filing also included the company's\nfirst disclosure of Monday's talk with New York analysts.\n\nThe company's stock reacted with one of the larger losses in a soft\nelectric utility group, slipping as low as $29-1/8 Thursday morning\nbefore steadying to trade at $29-7/16, off 7/8.\n\nThe regulated utility subsidiary -- Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. -- paid\n$700 million in unexpected power costs in June and incurred similar\ncharges in July and August, according to spokesman Greg Pruett.\n\nPG&amp;E's 8K filing noted the utility has authority from the California\nPublic Utility Commission to issue of to $1.7 billion of short-term\nfinancing. Last Friday, the filing continued, it applied to the\ncommission for the authority to issue an additional $1.4 billion of\nshort-term financing.\n\nIt also said the utility is considering the sale of additional long-term\ndebt to finance wholesale power purchase costs and its other capital\nrequirements.\n\nAs noted by several security analysts, PG&amp;E chief executive Robert Glynn\ntold the New York meeting the utility wants to boost power rates as soon\nas possible to recover the surging costs the company has been forced to\npay to buy electricity in California's chaotic wholesale power market.\n\nOther analysts also point out the utility is facing the possibility of\nsignificant write-offs for power costs it will be unable to collect.\n\nIn the 8K filing, PG&amp;E said ``if the utility determines that its\nuncollected wholesale power purchase costs are not probable of recovery,\nthen the utility would be required to write off the unrecoverable\nportion.''\n\nABN AMRO utility analysts that attended Monday's meeting said PG&amp;E\nestimates the summer price surge has created an additional $1.2 billion\nof stranded cost on top of the existing yet to be recovered stranded\ncost on its balance sheet of $4.4 billion.\n\nThe $4.4 billion total includes unrecovered transition costs of $3.0\nbillion, which the 8K said could also reduce future earnings.\n\n``A worst case scenario,'' according to ABN AMRO, would be ``a $3.2\nbillion net, or $8.50 per share, write-off of unrecoverable stranded\ncost'' if the present high power prices continue to the end California's\ntransition to a deregulated power market.\n\n Business | US Market | By Industry | IPO | AP | S&amp;P | International |\nPRNews | BizWire | CCN | CNW ]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nClick Here!\nRelated QuotesSRE 20 +0\ndelayed 20 mins - disclaimerGet QuotesThursday September 14, 5:04 pm\nEastern Time\n\nFERC chairman says deregulation should proceed\n\nWASHINGTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday that California's\ntroubled power markets should force tough changes to make deregulation\nwork better, not end the movement.\n\nSpeaking at the commission's regular meeting, Hoecker and the three\nother FERC commissioners reiterated their support for deregulation, but\nsaid the experience in California, where prices spiked considerably for\nresidents of San Diego and on wholesale markets, must result in new\npolicies.\n\n``I personally reject the notion that this is the beginning of the end\nfor deregulation,'' Hoecker said.\n\nFERC conducted a hearing in San Diego on Tuesday, allowing discussion\nfrom utilities, regulators and the public on what has become a\ndisastrous summer for California's power markets.\n\nUnder the terms of the deregulation of California's electric utility\nindustry, customers of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) subsidiary San\nDiego Gas and Electric became the first in the nation to pay\nmarket-based rates without a safety net.\n\nHoecker said now ``was the time to make tough decisions'' on retooling\nderegulation laws to make them work better.\n\nFERC Commissioner Curt Hebert said the problem is not just in\nCalifornia, but also in New York and New England, where structural\nproblems with deregulation efforts have triggered market power, price,\nsupply and reliability concerns.\n\nMany California and national lawmakers want FERC to declare that rates\nset by suppliers this summer were not ``just and reasonable'' as\nrequired under law.\n\nSuch a declaration could be followed by action to impose market\nrestrictions such as price caps across the western U.S..\n\nExperts say such a move could lead to the demise of the California Power\nExchange, which was set up as part of the deregulationof the state's\npower industry.\n\nTwenty-four states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to\nopen retail electricity markets to competition.\n\nA report on the California price spikes this summer by FERC\ninvestigative staff is due to be received by the commission by Nov. 1.\n\nEmail this story - View most popular stories emailed\n\nKaren Edson\nkedson@ns.net\n916/552-7070&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Rick:\nI hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining \nthe GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  \nI look forward for your comments and advise.\n\nBest regards\n\nAI\n\nHere are the salient features:\nMeeting with Wade:\nThe meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs \nto be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and \nagrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support \nfrom Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what \nneeds to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an \neffective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) \njust in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be \&quot;penny wise \nand pound foolish\&quot; given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that \nHouston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is \ncomplete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. \nGA Needs in India:\nThe regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five \nareas: \na)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), \nb)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, \nc)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), \ne)  Government of India, and \nf)  EBS.  \nThe volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following \nscenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) \nEnron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of \nyet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:\n\n        Arbitration  Renegotiation\nThird party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high\nDealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high\nDealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high\nGovernment of India, and      high   high\nEBS.         medium  medium\n\nIt is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC \nseems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the \nsense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the \nbest way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any \ndegree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a \nrisk-averse person shall take the \&quot;undetermined scenario\&quot; as equal to \n\&quot;renegotiation\&quot;, while a risk-taker shall take the \&quot;undetermined\&quot;\&quot; as equal \nto arbitration.  \n\nPersonal:\nIt is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in \nthe \&quot;renegotiation\&quot; scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a \nvisit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working \nunder legal/commercial.  \n\nSuggested Approach:\nContinue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for \nthe coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the \nsuggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is \&quot;if there is \nrenegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full \ntime basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis\&quot;.  \n\nCaveat:\nIt is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the \nsuggested approach above one way or another. \n\n\n----- Forwarded by Amr Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/15/2001 05:57 AM -----\n\n\tAmr Ibrahim\n\t06/12/2001 06:54 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: India - Progress Report One\n\nRick: \nThis is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and \nshort talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting \nwith Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from \nGA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing \npolicy of GA, namely, \&quot;GA shall provide the required support\&quot;.  \nNotwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give \nHouston the final say.   \n\nIn the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA \ncontribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and \nb) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, \nmost conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  \nThe feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit \nIndia (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams \nin London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation \nto transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the \nvaluation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is \nnoteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market \nbasis, but rather on accounting basis.  \nAs most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely \nroute (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added \nhowever, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated \nin Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to \ncomplete phase II which we are refusing).  \nIf renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy \nand capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW \nkit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such \nresponsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks \nassociated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every \nissue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and \nsolved.  \nThe decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest \nlevel; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them \ndid not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned \nas a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the \nregulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the \nlater, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the \nrenegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment \n(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 \nbillion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the \nissues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of \nrenegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there \nis a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for \ndealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to \nexpand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  \n\nI shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you \nhave any questions and/or advise.\n\nBest regards\n\n\nAI&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Bruce just fyi, I am already on top of this.  Ken Blades and I had a \nconversation with Justin Williams yesterday about this ongoing saga (which \nhas been ongoing a long time...).  Essentially here's where we are and why it \nis a good thing that United India has sued us in the London Court.  \n\nIn the early part of the dispute, we gave consideration to litigation vs. \narbitration, but we could only sue UI in India, which was a bad option.\n\nSeveral months ago, after lengthy settlement discussions with United India \n(UI) and reinsurers about DPC's DSU claim resulting from the first rotor \nproblems, UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration under the policy.  The \nnotice was curious because UI clearly disputed both liability and quantum; \nhowever, the policy's arbitration clause states that arbitration can only \ninclude issues of quantum.\n\nThrough a series of correspondence, we believe UI has agreed to arbitrate \nliability &amp; quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the \narbitration.  (The cut through clause in the policy enables DPC to recover \ndirectly from the reinsurers).  It appears, however, (at least we speculate) \nthat UI has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly, that while they \nhave served DPC a notice of arbitration, the clause limits arbitration to \nquantum, not liability.  Hence UI's declaratory judgment action in the London \nCommercial Court to determine liability.  Now, this gives us an option we \ndidn't have earlier: litigation in the London court since they have submitted \nto jurisdiction  or arbitration.  There are pros &amp; cons to both which we are \ndiscussing with Justin and Peter.\n\nAn interesting piece of the puzzle is that UI is now trying to realign the \nparties since DPC is the insured seeking recovery.    The reason UI wants to \ndo this is because (i) it would put the burden of proof on DPC as claimant &amp; \n(ii) UI as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of \nproof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information \nDPC has. \nPros of litigation: The London court is less likely to permit this \nrealignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural \nmatters of this type.  We also believe the London court will be cheaper (no \ncost of  3 arbitrators) and quicker, since there are statutory time lines.  \nUI has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has, at every \nopportunity, slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything DPC \nproposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc.  Also, in \nthe London court, there is a strong possibility DPC can get an advance \nsecurity for attorneys' fees as the defendant, which is not possible in \narbitration.\nDownside of litigation:  It is less likely that DPC can litigate directly \nagainst the reinsurers for procedural reasons.  Furthermore, DPC could \npotentially end up in two proceedings: litigation to determine liability &amp; \narbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive.   \nKen Blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior \nmeeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario.  Until we see the \ndocument, however, we cannot determine whether the stipulation  is \nenforceable because of issues of authority etc.\n\nThe bottom line is, now that UI has sued us in London court, we have a choice \nwe didn't have before.  We plan to obtain Ken's document re the stipulation, \nsend a letter to UI and then see their reaction before we decide. Now that \nwe've been served it just shortens our time limit to do this.

Hoecker also urged the congressmen \nto give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility \nindustry's transition to competition.\n\nHoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where \nsome state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after \nprices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this \nsummer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will \nconsider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk \npower markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that \nauthority to do so retroactively.\n\n\&quot;The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed,\&quot; a FERC staffer says.\n\nFor its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the \ncommission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market \nparticipants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA) \n-- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not \nconsider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is \nprobably needed to see if the commission can do that.\n\n\&quot;If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, \nwe will do so,\&quot; Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept. \n21. \&quot;If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by \nrevoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which \nwe grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if \nrefunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the \ncommission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures \nwith California (and other states).\&quot;\n\nCurrently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions \nmade 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this \ncase would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive \nratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be \nchanged.\n\n\&quot;Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for \nany period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly \nproblematic,\&quot; Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert. \n\&quot;There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be \nunlawful and we would need legislation to do that.\&quot;\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a \nmid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a \nsevere energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker, \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nAdministrator Carol Browner.\n\nMuch of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both \nRichardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for \nfailing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson \nexpressed his \&quot;disappointment\&quot; that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed \nthat FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.\n\n\&quot;Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United \nStates under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable \nservice,\&quot; Hoecker said. \&quot;The commission's open access rules are not binding \non the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by \nentities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of \npublic power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition \nin wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers \nand sellers.\&quot;\n\nHoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and \nCalifornia's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives \nclear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do \nto solve the market problems.\n\n\&quot;Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to \nobtain the energy they need at reasonable prices,\&quot; Hoecker said. \&quot;Most \ncritically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting \nelectricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition. \nFederal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate \ninvestment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of \nreliability which is crucial to the digital economy.\&quot;\n\nThe chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate \nregional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability \nstandards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the \ncommission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources \ndo not expect the bill to pass (see related story).\n\n\n\n\n\n_source: Electric Power Alert\n_date: October 2, 2000\n_issue: Vol. 10, No. 20\n_title: FERC's Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority\n, Inside Washington Publishers&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>\n<P><BR><BR></P></DIV>\n<DIV></DIV>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;From: marketingDM@sdabocconi.it \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;To: \&quot;Monika Causholli\&quot; <MCAUSHOLLI@HOTMAIL.COM>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Subject: Re: SDA Bocconi - Masters Division \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Date: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 14:51:39 +0000 \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Dear Ms. Causholli, \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;following to your request we inform you that the check card and \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;envelopes for the MBA Progarmme have already been sent to you. \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Besides, we would like to inform you that you can consult our course \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;description at www.sdabocconi.it and calendar of our information \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;session at www.sdabocconi.it/ad/en/md/calendario1.html \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;For any further information, please, do not hesitate to contact us. \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Sincerely, \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Marketing Service \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Master's Division \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;EI \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;From: \&quot;Monika Causholli\&quot; <MCAUSHOLLI@HOTMAIL.COM>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;To: marketingDM@sdabocconi.it \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Subject: Re: SDA Bocconi - Masters Division \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Date: Wed, 21 Nov 2001 10:47:32 -0800 \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P><BR><BR>&amp;nbsp;</P></DIV>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P>My address is for the check card is:</P>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P>Monika Causholli</P>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P>2440 North Boulevard # 5205</P>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P>Houston, Texas 77098</P>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<P>USA</P>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;From: marketingDM@sdabocconi.it \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;To: mcausholli@hotmail.com \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Subject: SDA Bocconi - Masters Division \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 11:17:34 +0000 \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Dear Ms. Causholli, \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;we thank you for the interest shown in our activities. \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt; \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;Following to your request we inform you that you can pay the \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;application fee in US Dollars if you can't do a bank transfer or \n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;\n<DIV></DIV>&amp;gt;check in Euro.

I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLawner, Leslie  \nSent:\tWednesday, September 05, 2001 12:40 PM\nTo:\tCantrell, Rebecca W.; Miller, Stephanie\nSubject:\tRE: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004\n\nThe CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&amp;E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&amp;E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tCantrell, Rebecca W.  \nSent:\tWednesday, September 05, 2001 11:23 AM\nTo:\tMiller, Stephanie\nCc:\tLawner, Leslie\nSubject:\tRE: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004\n\nSteph - Leslie and I were just talking about this, and one thing we need to keep in mind is that any attempt to modify the PG&amp;E recall rights would almost certainly be opposed by the CPUC, especially if it was to benefit Enron.  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLawner, Leslie  \nSent:\tWednesday, September 05, 2001 12:07 PM\nTo:\tMiller, Stephanie\nCc:\tCantrell, Rebecca W.\nSubject:\tFW: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004\n\nI thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&amp;E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLawner, Leslie  \nSent:\tTuesday, September 04, 2001 11:04 AM\nTo:\tMiller, Stephanie\nCc:\tCantrell, Rebecca W.\nSubject:\tRE: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004\n\nAs to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says \&quot;and if it so recalled (by PG&amp;E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&amp;E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.\&quot;  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.\n\nAs to the \&quot;traditional rate making\&quot; valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&amp;E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&amp;E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out. \n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMiller, Stephanie  \nSent:\tTuesday, September 04, 2001 8:17 AM\nTo:\tLawner, Leslie\nSubject:\tRE: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004\n\nWhen is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?\n\nHow would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&amp;E paid based upon traditional rate making policies?

We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the \nshares in a Cayman entity.\n\nI propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those \ncertificates to Enron South America LLC, the sole shareholder of EBPH XII.  \nThe value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US \ntax treatment.   Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock, using \nthe screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good \nindicator of the fair market value.  For tax purposes, we will assume the \nvalue to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a \nnarrow band on either side of that value.    If the first 1.25M certificate \nis sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC, we will need \nto adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a \nvalid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the \ndistribution..\n\nIf the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis, EBPHXII will \nrecognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the \ndistribution was made to Enron South America LLC. This would result in \nreporting a tax expense in 2000 and perhaps book income in 2001 if that sale \ntakes place after the end of the year.   \n\nIf the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less \nthan the historical tax basis, the distribution to Enron South America LLC \nwill result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII.\n\nIf the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies, the same \nvaluation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on \nthe sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated.  Distributing the shares to Enron \nSouth America LLC will be much easier.\n\nLynn\n\n\n\nBruce Harris\n12/08/2000 11:31 AM\nTo: Robert H George/NA/Enron@Enron, Kay Young/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Dan Boyle/Corp/Enron@Enron, Lynn Aven/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe \nKishkill/SA/Enron@Enron, Kent Castleman/NA/Enron@Enron, Bruce \nHarris/NA/Enron@Enron, Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edward E \nGraham/SA/Enron@Enron, Rick Hopkinson/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey E \nSommers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Next steps with Copel shares\n\n\nRobert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of \nBrazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next \nweek the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron \nvault.  \n\nHere is what we now need to do:\n\n1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it \ninto three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately \n1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.\n\n2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital \nsplit?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.\n\n3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision \n(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel \nshares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will \ngo to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would \nhappen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about \n15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).\n\n4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need \nto put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we \nwill bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).\n\n5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to \nestablish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate \nto unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to \nfigure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for \nevery small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these \n1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets \n(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 \nmonths time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  \n\nRobert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer \nshares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M \&quot;unrestriction\&quot; with BONY and Skadden. \n\n\nRegards,  Bruce\n713-853-0950&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:19604,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6eyJyZXBvLmNvbnRlbnQucmVhZCI6dHJ1ZX0sImlhdCI6MTc0MjkyMzE0NCwic3ViIjoiL2RhdGFzZXRzL0dhbGFrdGlzY2hlR3Vya2UvZW1haWxzXzU1MDBfdG9fNzUwMCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MjkyNjc0NCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.MJXhRovx2dyvjaIludrhwRfitd9960aIyxvxYB3SJ_ZOL3uLExN-8jpT76dgBmIIlMJXg4SzjNmK_gjvum0-DA&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;GalaktischeGurke/emails_5500_to_7500&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;hasParquetFormat&quot;:true,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;64a2725a720ef7b92d429846&quot;,&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;/avatars/56304b80c5e7a9f43e9887c7721684a9.svg&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Salomon K&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;GalaktischeGurke&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:true,&quot;isHf&quot;:false,&quot;isHfAdmin&quot;:false,&quot;isMod&quot;:false,&quot;followerCount&quot;:2},&quot;compact&quot;:true}"><div class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden shadow-xs mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2  px-2.5"><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

I think that we need to talk with EWS Tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page.  I am concerned that some of Gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs.

Please advise.

Bob,

Per Section 25.345 (c) of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as "eligible generation" under Section 25.345(c)(B). In Section 25.345(i), an end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T &amp; D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.  

Also a retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation who also receives electrical service that require the delivery of power through the facilities of a T &amp; D utility, shall be responsible for payment of stranded costs charges based solely on the services that are actually provided by the T &amp; D utility.

The short answers to your questions are:
1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any T&amp;D services from TXU.
2. If Rock Tenn uses T&amp;D facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T&amp; D utility. 
3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities T&amp;D services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.
4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Gloria,

Per the information you provided Trish (below) concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW. Therefore, what are the "DG rules" and how do these rules impact Rock Tenn's requirement to pay CTC? What if they only use the utility's T&amp;D facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utility's T&amp;D facilities, as if they are no longer in business? Is TXU expected to have significant stranded costs?

Thanks, Bob

Trish,

Per Chapter 39.252(b)(1) of the Texas Utilities Code, recovery of stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers within the utility's certificated territory as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid CTC's by switching to a new on-site generation. New on-site generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T &amp; D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 12/31/99. (If the self-gen facility's output is 10 MW or less, it will be governed by the DG  rules.)

If a customer commences taking energy from a new on-site generation (with output of more than10 MW ) which materially reduces or eliminates the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the CTC which is in effect during the month.

Any CTC assessed on such a self -gen facility after it becomes fully operational, shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with services actually provided by the T &amp; D utility to the customer after the facility has become fully operational. So if no services actually provided, there should be no payment.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria</span></div></div>

Subject:	FERC exceeded jurisdiction w/RTO say consumer groups

FERC Exceeded Jurisdiction With RTO Order - Consumer Grps 

Aug. 14, 2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) 

(This article was originally published Monday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. 

The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the country's transmission system in independent hands. 

Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. 

"The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs," the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. 

FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. 

The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. 

The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid "at breakneck speed" without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. 

Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven't defined what that tariff and standard should be. 

"Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks," said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday's filing. 

All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. 

The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert's resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. 

The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won't be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. 

This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate 

The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. 

"Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it's done," Buxton said.

Great Wines and Gifts

1998 Ivan Tamas Zinfandel, Livermore Valley, California, $8.95
An outstanding, fruit-filled Zinfandel produced from old-vine grapes 
grown in Northern California's historic Livermore Valley. Intense 
raspberry and dark cherry fruit flavors with black pepper aromas; 
medium-bodied, with nice depth and concentration. 

1997 Adella Zinfandel, Napa Valley, California, $14.99
A big mouthful of a Napa Zin that still offers supple smoothness and 
easy drinkability. The addition of Sangiovese and Syrah gives the 
wine extra body, depth, and flavor. A perfectly targeted Zinfandel 
that hits the palate right in the bull's-eye. 

Port and Chocolate Cigars, $30.00
This soothing tawny port from Tuke Holdsworth is a great way to take 
the chill out of a cool winter evening. Paired with luscious 
chocolate cigars, it inspires warm feelings all through the winter. 
Packaged on a sparkling silver plated bottle coaster. 

Romantic Duet, $35.00
When it comes to attractive matches, this international couple - a 
rich, toe-tingling French bubbly (originally blended for Czar 
Nicholas II of Russia) and a graceful, supple Napa Valley Merlot - is 
not only glamorous, but also harmonious. 

1997 Sonora TC Vineyard, 'Old Vine Zinfandel', Sierra 
Foothills, $24.00
Big and foward in style with tons of intense fruit and firm tannins. 
Classic Sierra Foothills Zinfandel from a 90 year old vineyard. If 
Sonora's two Zins were singing in the choir, "TC Vineyard" would be 
singing baritone and "Story Vineyard" tenor. 

1999 Left Bank Macon-Ige Vieilles Vignes, Burgundy, France, $12.00
Clean and direct, this friendly wine is sure to please anyone tired 
of oaky Chardonnay. Sold exclusively at the popular Left Bank 
restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area and through wine.com, it's 
made in an easy-to-drink style, perfect for bistro food: big, soft, 
pale-straw in color, with aromas of green apple, hay, and lime.

Two Weeks to ZAP Mania

Now is a time of year when Zinfandel lovers find themselves 
salivating even more profusely than usual. Such Pavlovian symptoms 
are observable with the approach of January 27, the date of the 
upcoming ZAP tasting in San Francisco. 

ZAP (Zinfandel Advocates and Producers) was formed by a group of 
impassioned wine producers in 1992 to raise awareness of Zinfandel 
and promote it as America's "native" wine. Like other members of the 
Vitis vinifera family, Zinfandel's origins lie somewhere in Europe, 
but nobody has been able to determine exactly where; DNA testing has 
shown the grape to be identical to the Primitivo of southern Italy, 
but it's documented in the United States earlier than it can be 
traced to Italy. Zinfandel has been grown and vinified in California 
since the mid-19th century, establishing it as America's contribution 
to the world of fine wine. 

While Zinfandel's fortunes have risen and fallen since its arrival in 
the New World 150 years ago, it's always been a grape and wine that 
inspired feverish loyalty. Now, as the 21st century commences, Zin 
seems to have it both ways: It's enjoying an unprecedented level of 
popularity and prestige, but its adherents still have the 
warm-and-cozy feeling of cult membership. 

This phenomenon is on lavish display at the annual ZAP tasting, a 
boisterous party that traditionally takes place on the Saturday 
before the Super Bowl. Certified in the Guinness Book of World 
Records as the world's biggest one-varietal wine tasting, the event 
attracted more than 200 wineries and 6,000 wine lovers last year. 
This time, for its 10th anniversary, it's being conducted in two 
different buildings at San Francisco's Fort Mason Center. Advance 
tickets cost $35 for ZAP members and $45 for non-members, with a 
limited amount available at the door for $50 on the day of the event. 

If you can't make it to the tasting, another easy way to sample the 
state of Zin is wine.com's selection of Zinfandel in all its forms 
and guises.

Also give me your analysis wherein the Counterparty receivable financing is more generic, without specific references to contracts but a global reference to receivables in connection with a product type, and assume representations by Counterparty to Bank that do not include setoff rights as any type of "permitted encumbrance or charge."  Would the Bank still be put on reasonable inquiry vis a vis the Enron position?

Subject:	Setoff and ISDA Section 7(b) Transfer Provision; Comments on New Draft of Master Netting

Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form regarding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our schedule.

(g)	Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, "X") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, "Y") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's "priority" position (assuming Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setoff right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables. 

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron has made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
 
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignment provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the master agreement and transactions "as security".  Please review and advise of any particular language you think should be added.  

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) provision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the end of 7(b), ";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subject [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section]."

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master netting agreement?

Subject: Legislative Update


I will send out a real legislative report next week.  In the meantime, I
thought you might appreciate a quick run-down of what actually happened in
the final hours of this year's wild legislative session.

The good news is that the public benefit charge bill passed easily with a
10-year term and no statutory harm was done.  The bad news is that utilities
captured the deregulation debate and successfully painted generators as
villains and the wholesale market as "broken."

Major legislative actions on energy matters follow.  If you have any
questions or would like a copy of final legislation, please call.

AB 995 (Wright) and SB 1194 (Sher), which extend public benefit charges for
energy conservation, renewable energy development, and RD&amp;D, passed the
State Legislature by large margins.  Recent indications are that the
Governor will sign the bills, although interested companies should join IEP
in sending letters urging him to do so.

Power plant siting was front and center the last week of the session.  As
recently as Wednesday of this week, the bill was so bad for new power plant
development that IEP opposed the expedited siting provisions.  They were
rewritten by Republican staff and CEC attorneys to provide a 6-month process
for a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that might
help those few entities that can start the process in full compliance with
local rules.  This provision is available for both combined cycle facilities
and peaking facilities.  The bill also includes a provision for four-month
approval of amendments to pending applications providing for the
installation of temporary peaking generation  on sites that will be
developed into combined cycle facilities within three years.  The CEC
expects this to apply so a single pending application.  Finally, the bill
includes language directing the CPUC and the EOB to be helpful on ISO issues
that affect the willingness self-generators to remain interconnected with
the grid.

Utility efforts to craft legislation assuring them of collection of large
negative balances in their Transition Revenue Accounts failed when they
could not reach agreement with representatives of large customer groups.  In
its place, the Legislature passed a non-binding resolution directing the
CPUC to investigate the issue and including highly offensive language on
$100 price caps and retroactive recalculation of market clearing prices.
Legislation establishing a retroactive cap on SDG&amp;E rates and providing no
assurance of cost recovery to Sempra passed the Legislature.  Companion
legislation that most observers expect the Governor to veto provides $150
million of General Fund money to SDG&amp;E.

A draft of so-called "sunshine" legislation surfaced late in the process.
The draft empowered the Electricity Oversight Board to collect anything it
might be interested in from the ISO, PX, utilities, generators, and
marketers and to treat the information confidentially.  The draft faced
unified opposition and did not make its way into any legislation.

AB 1002 (Wright) establishing public benefit charges on the natural gas
system passed the Legislature.  It continues to include language exempting
electricity generation from the charges.

		 Subject: Project Raptor - Private Hedge Candidates

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.

I think I am one of the people who raised the issue about the Asset 
Description in my mark-up of the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheet that I 
received this am from Stuart and returned to him midday. As I read the memo 
below, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying 
asset. 

The asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., 
and an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock 
Purchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), 
Catalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common 
stock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and 
Enron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), 
Sundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to 
purchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. 

There are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option 
shares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that 
would cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred 
to below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, 
is restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for 
registration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the 
CCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board.

Under an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with 
the restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with 
the proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch 
pharmaceutical company)  and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to 
Catalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to 
convert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock 
split, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective 
date of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon 
the effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as 
amended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. 
The distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is 
subject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent 
closing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly 
looked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other 
support) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the 
uncertainties attendant thereto. 

The Omnibus Agreement also contains provisions amending Sundance's 
registration rights, the board representation provisions in the original 
Stock Purchase Agreement, and certain transfer restrictions ( to liberalize 
them and allow the Raptor transaction to take place). There are also 
agreements related to Enron North America's Xonon Technology Implementation 
Agreement with GE and West LB, which do not directly affect the Series B 
Preferred. These provisions instead go to the development program for CCSI's 
technology, to which ENA contributes funding, and conform that agreement to a 
change in CCSI's and GE's strategy for commercializing the technology. The 
funding obligation itself is interconnected with the turbine purchases for 
ENA's Pastoria project in California, but I don't believe that transaction 
needs analysis for these purposes, 

To comply with SEC rules in connection with the distribution, CCSI has filed 
an S-1 registration statement registering the CCSI common stock to be 
distributed to Catalytica's shareholders with the SEC, and Catalytica, Inc. 
has filed a merger proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its 
solicitation of Catalytica stockholder approval to the acquisition 
transaction. Comments are expected from  the SEC in 4 to 6 weeks.

Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this matter further, and I am 
instructed to request that you return the revised copy of the Raptor I 
Proposal Sheet to me and copy Mary Cook and Lisa Mellancamp thereon. The 
foregoing description may be more than you need for the summary, but it 
really is a very abbreviated snapshot of the transaction. All the documents 
related to the Preferred Stock and Option, including the executed Omnibus 
Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, have been previously delivered to 
Sara Shackleton and Hope Vargas.

		 Subject: Project Raptor - Private Hedge Candidates

It has come to my attention that questions have been raised in reviewing the 
Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheets regarding the type of information that 
should be set forth in the category entitled "ASSET DESCRIPTION".  The Master 
Derivatives Agreement ("MDA") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the 
"Assets" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed.  
For purposes of the MDA, "Assets" is defined as "assets, including without 
limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other 
ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets."  Therefore, 
the description should include both the nature of the "Asset" (i.e. whether 
it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit 
about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan 
or working interest).

Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the "Enron 
person completing this form" (This is the 3rd line under the heading 
"GENERAL" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised 
Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to 
both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp.   

The pressure to complete these Raptor hedges remains high and therefore your 
immediate attention is greatly appreciated.  Many thanks.

Stuart</span></div></div>

Please find below some text for Eric's letter.  I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter.  If you have questions or would like some other information, please let me know.  Also, on the question of Enron letterhead, I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site.  Unless you have electronic letterhead, the issue may be moot.

Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.

One major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.

Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin "trading" commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.

Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with "hand-holding" or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.

Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&amp;T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,

Pursuant to our conversation of this morning, I just want to confirm the 
following.

1.   We have agreed that we will use separate guarantees (for the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada, L.P. ("Engage Canada")) with respect to each of 
Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC") and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA").  This will 
allow for the appropriate guarantees to reference the peculiarities of each 
of Canadian and American law (as applicable) as well as deal with the 
potential "permanent establishment" tax issues we discussed.   As a result, 
Dan does not need to review the draft guarantee I sent to him on Wednesday.

2.  You are going to send me a revised credit sheet for the ECC-Engage Canada 
master physical agreement which removes references to the obligations of 
Engage Canada to ENA (likely requiring a guarantee of Westcoast Gas Inc. (on 
behalf of Engage Canada) to ECC in the amount of US$15million (the "New ECC 
Guarantee").

3.  Dan is to coordinate negotiating/obtaining a new guarantee from Westcoast 
Gas Inc. (on behalf of Engage Canada) to ENA in the amount of US$5 million 
(pursuant to the master physical agreement between Engage Canada and ENA).

4.  I am still not sure what we are doing with respect to the "Enron Corp." 
guarantee which was provided to Engage Canada and Engage Energy US, L.P. 
("Engage US") in the amount of US$35million (which guarantees the obligations 
of ENA, EPMI and ECC) (the "Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee").   According to 
the credit sheet last provided to me, Enron Corp. is to provide a guarantee 
in the amount of US$25million but you were going to check to see if we were 
leaving the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee in place.  

If we are replacing/amending the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee, we need to 
coordinate with counsel from all three of ENA, EPMI and ECC to ensure that we 
are properly revoking the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee or amending it 
appropriately.  Ultimately, I would prefer that the Existing Enron Guarantee 
be amended to remove the references to ECC such that we can arrange for a 
separate Enron Corp guarantee on behalf of ECC.  This would allow for greater 
flexibility/efficiency in the event that the industry or trading relationship 
between ECC and Engage Canada develops and future amendments are required.  

Please let me know how you would like me to proceed with respect to point 4.

Thanks,

Mark Powell

Subject: Re: Engage Energy Canada L.P. Guarantee  

Mark,

The guaranty you are providing to Engage Energy Canada should cover both ECC 
and ENA although should only reference the Master Firm Contract between ECC 
and Engage Canada.  Dan has been working on a separate guaranty that will 
reference the Master Contract between ENA and Engage US that is currently 
being drafted.  The reason ENA is included on the guaranty for Engage Canada 
is because of business done at Dawn in Eastern Canada through ENA.  

If you and Dan want to issue one guaranty to Engage US and Engage Canada 
referencing both contracts I think that would be a good idea, the guaranty 
amount should be between $45MM and $50MM and include several Enron entities:  
ENA, HPL, EPMI (referencing the Master Energy agreement), Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc and ECC.

Let's discuss further in the morning as to how about resolving this.

Thanks
Russell

In furtherance of the message which I left for you, please find attached a 
copy of a replacement guarantee for your review.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of 
guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the 
project, the 
 US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to 
guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US 
L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the "Existing Guarantee"), is to be 
replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy 
entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).  

As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with 
revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which 
Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron 
Canada Corp. (the "ECC Physical Master") as well as the master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North 
America Corp. (the "ENA Physical Master").   Russell had allocated US$15 
million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and 
US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.

Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an 
"Amended and Restated" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of 
significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee 
(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have 
prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas 
Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to 
ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking 
for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement 
guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the 
Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to 
Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which 
I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master 
and the appropriate contact information for notices).

When you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined 
replacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the 
Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.

Thanks for your help.

Mark Powell ((403) 974-6708)



Note to Russell:  Russell, you were going to confirm for me that the existing 
Enron Corp. guarantee delivered to Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage 
Energy US L.P. to secure the obligations of Enron Canada Corp., Enron North 
America Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (in the amount of $35 million) 
dated June 1, 1998 is NOT to be replaced.  Has there been any progress on 
this front?</span></div></div>

_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Commodity prices are frequently at the mercy of weather conditions,
and this week was no exception as Grains and Oilseeds enjoyed sharp
recoveries based on cold temperatures in the Midwest and a drought
in China.  Corn and Wheat zoomed to two-week highs.  Hogs ran to
five-week highs on technical factors. Softs were on a downslope,
but had a Friday bounce.  Meantime, Gasoline and Crude Oil fell off
the pace as supply concerns eased.  Copper was also under pressure
reflecting subdued demand and concerns about the US economy.  Nobody
was willing to bet on a sharp Fed rate cut, and this left Bonds
higher and short-term Treasuries lower.  The Dollar was strong,
but mostly because the Euro turned weak on dim prospects of central
bank intervention.  The slide in Gold steadied a bit Friday.  Stock
index futures were flat to lower on the week, but finished on a
positive note.

Andrew:

Just one of these automatic methods . . . JUST ONE
. . . is enough for you to make a career trading
options professionally.

YES, these are the exact techniques used by all
professionals to get rich trading options!

Like the former real estate broker who made over
$800,000 in just three months
- without a single loss!

Like the caddy who borrowed a small grubstake
and made over $100,000 per month for
70 consecutive months!

Or the former Bear's linebacker who's made
$16,634,699 in just three years!

These are all actual results achieved by options traders
 . . . starting with the very same secrets you'll have
after reading Paul Forchione's exciting manual,
"Trading Options Visually."

All NYMEX Division Clearing Members
All NYMEX Division Floor Traders

George Henderson, Vice President

RE:
Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading Floor and Clearing 
Members
________________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the June 2001 options contract for Cinergy (NOM1), 
Entergy (OTM1), Palo Verde (VOM1) and Cob (WOM1) is Thursday, May 24, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options 
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or 
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options 
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized 
representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169) 
personnel, as well as a representative of the Floor Committee will be 
available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and 
Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other questions or 
problems you may have.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

The Option Expiration process is a screen based process for which all 
information is provided on the screens on C21 terminals. No Option Expiration 
Reports will be provided. The following screens will assist you through the 
Option Expiration process:

previous 4 business days and trades adjusted for the previous 4 business days 
by adjustment date.

via transmission for that contract series will be disregarded.

ALL POSITIONS ARE DEEMED FINAL
Upon completion of all PCS input, all positions will be deemed final.

contract series or the Assignment List window which contains all your

E-Mail and by Fast Facts. This should occur within 1 hour of the last PCS 
input.

All Clearing Members are required to have an authorized representative(s) at 
their C21 workstations in preparation for any communication during the 
expiration process.

FAST FACTS
Clearing Members should call the Fast Facts information service 301-4871,

Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

Enron (news/quote) has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities.

In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into. 

But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron "expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations," declined to answer any questions about it.

The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance- sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.

One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. "There is an appearance that you are hiding something," he said.

After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. "They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand," he said in an interview. "They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them" as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. "I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans," he said. "In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here."

Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board "continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."

Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix (news/quote), an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors "have determined there is no write-down required," he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.

Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.

Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. "I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it," Mr. Lay said. "But let's move on to the next question."

Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 

Mr. Lay said he was sorry about "the misunderstanding" that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises.

The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.

After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company "will look into providing" such statements.

Source: Fort Worth Star - Telegram 
Publication date: 2001-05-19
Arrival time: 2001-05-21

Electricity generators around the country didn't need to read the Bush 
administration's energy plan to know there's already a strong market for 
their product. 
"It's a bit of frenzy, I would say," Lane Kadel said of demand for the 
natural gas-fired turbines brokered by his company, Utility Warehouse.com of 
Portland, Ore. The 5-year-old enterprise, originally started to help electric 
utilities buy and sell surplus equipment, has seen demand for 
electricity-generating machinery move into high- voltage territory in recent 
months. 
With electricity already in short supply in parts of the country, headlines 
of rolling blackouts in California, and growth projected to require more 
power, U.S. electricity generators have announced plans for 312,836 megawatts 
of new capacity. That's equal to about 40 percent of the nation's existing 
generating capacity. 
So it was no surprise to anybody in the industry that electricity figured 
prominently Thursday in President Bush's energy plan. The plan largely 
emphasizes the need to add more energy supplies, projecting that the nation 
will need to add 393,000 megawatts of capacity by 2020. In 1999, the nation 
added 10,266 megawatts of new capacity, according to the Energy Department. 
Bush's plan also aims to speed up additions to generating capacity by easing 
licensing, permitting and other regulatory review, including rules to 
encourage more nuclear power plants. 
The Bush plan, industry people say, apparently contains nothing to discourage 
the industry's push to add supply. 
"If there is, we haven't seen it," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the 
Electric Power Supply Association, a group of independent power producers. 
The plans for new capacity that have already been announced represent more 
than $150 billion in potential investment in new electricity supply. 
Not all the planned capacity will be built, at least not right away, said Tom 
Rose, vice president of public affairs at TXU in Dallas. But a lot will, and 
the projects that are postponed will probably still go through permitting and 
land acquisition, "things that don't cost a lot of money," Rose said. 
With that groundwork done, new capacity could come on line all the faster 
when the market justifies it, he said. 
The emphasis on adding supply doesn't please everyone in the electricity 
business. 
Jerry Davia, president of Orion Energy in Sausalito, Calif., would rather see 
the government encourage investment in energy efficiency. Davia's company 
consults with companies, including San Antonio-based H.E. Butt Grocery Co., 
to design and finance energy-saving systems. 
"There's tons of new, energy-efficient technology out there all the time," he 
said. "There's enough conservation to tackle any problems we have." 
Energy users are probably in the best position to decide which energy 
efficiencies make sense financially, but the government could make the 
economics more attractive with tax credits and other incentives, he said. 
"I don't see anything that bodes well" in the Bush plan as far as subsidies 
and credits, he said. "And there's nothing just for California." 
That's fine with Karl Rabago, managing director of the Rocky Mountain 
Institute, a not-for-profit organization that advocates efficient use of 
resources, including energy. 
Rabago said he doesn't want energy use subsidized, because that 
short-circuits the market mechanism that forces users to reduce consumption 
in response to higher prices. At the same time, he also doesn't like aspects 
of the Bush plan that he believes subsidize energy production. 
Jesper Michaelsen, sales manager for wind turbine manufacturer NEG Micon USA 
of Rolling Hills, Ill., said he was disappointed that Bush's plan doesn't set 
any specific goals for increasing the amount of power generated from 
renewable sources. Wind and solar sources account for just 2 percent of the 
nation's total electricity market. 
But Allen Barnett, who heads solar panel maker AstroPower of Newark, Del., 
said he's thankful for any attention at all, given the oil-and-gas 
backgrounds of many Bush advisers. The Bush plan does include tax credits for 
people who purchase solar panels. 
"It's the most we could hope for," Barnett said. "I didn't expect them to 
abandon their roots." 
The Bush electricity measures that don't deal with adding generating capacity 
address ways to build a bigger transmission system to carry power from 
generators to users. 
Two major recommendations include the creation of a national electricity grid 
and giving federal regulators power to condemn private property for 
infrastructure improvements such as new electrical transmission lines and 
natural gas pipelines to deliver fuel to new generators. 
Today, the United States has three regional electricity transmission grids: 
Western, Eastern and Texas, which is mostly on its own grid and - unlike 
energy-strapped states such as California - has a surplus of electricity. 
Texas is virtually unconnected to the two regional grids, and the two 
regional grids likewise aren't efficiently linked. 
"It's going to lead to a lot of new investment," utility analyst Barry 
Abramson, of the UBS Warburg investment firm, said of Bush's proposals. 
"Right now, the country is full of transmission bottlenecks that make the 
system less efficient and hinder competition and the delivery of power." 
The 1995 Texas Legislature commissioned a study into tying Texas into the 
national grids and concluded that it would cost $500 million to $600 million, 
TXU's Rose said. 
"It is not easy," he said. "It all has to be done at the same time," because 
the amount of electricity moving between grids would quickly overload one or 
two connecting lines. 
Rose also said many states, including Texas, already allow governments to 
condemn private property, a process called eminent domain. Public 
transportation projects provide the most common use of eminent domain, along 
with the construction of pipelines. 
Kadel said boosting the nation's electricity infrastructure might be just as 
important as adding generating capacity. "Right now you don't have any way to 
move the electricity, so prices are high," he said.

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some

some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy</span></div></div>

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. 

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. 

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures." 

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC 

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. 

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. 

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated." 

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. 

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the second letter says. 

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting. 

Generators Confused

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. 

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. 

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. 

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. 

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. 

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. 

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

PG&amp;E faces borrowing, write-offs for power costs

By Jim Brumm

NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - This summer's surge in West Coast power
prices is causing California's largest utility to seek permission for
increased borrowings and consider significant write-offs, its parent
company PG&amp;E Corp. told the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday.

PG&amp;E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) 8K filing also included the company's
first disclosure of Monday's talk with New York analysts.

The company's stock reacted with one of the larger losses in a soft
electric utility group, slipping as low as $29-1/8 Thursday morning
before steadying to trade at $29-7/16, off 7/8.

The regulated utility subsidiary -- Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. -- paid
$700 million in unexpected power costs in June and incurred similar
charges in July and August, according to spokesman Greg Pruett.

PG&amp;E's 8K filing noted the utility has authority from the California
Public Utility Commission to issue of to $1.7 billion of short-term
financing. Last Friday, the filing continued, it applied to the
commission for the authority to issue an additional $1.4 billion of
short-term financing.

It also said the utility is considering the sale of additional long-term
debt to finance wholesale power purchase costs and its other capital
requirements.

As noted by several security analysts, PG&amp;E chief executive Robert Glynn
told the New York meeting the utility wants to boost power rates as soon
as possible to recover the surging costs the company has been forced to
pay to buy electricity in California's chaotic wholesale power market.

Other analysts also point out the utility is facing the possibility of
significant write-offs for power costs it will be unable to collect.

In the 8K filing, PG&amp;E said ``if the utility determines that its
uncollected wholesale power purchase costs are not probable of recovery,
then the utility would be required to write off the unrecoverable
portion.''

ABN AMRO utility analysts that attended Monday's meeting said PG&amp;E
estimates the summer price surge has created an additional $1.2 billion
of stranded cost on top of the existing yet to be recovered stranded
cost on its balance sheet of $4.4 billion.

The $4.4 billion total includes unrecovered transition costs of $3.0
billion, which the 8K said could also reduce future earnings.

``A worst case scenario,'' according to ABN AMRO, would be ``a $3.2
billion net, or $8.50 per share, write-off of unrecoverable stranded
cost'' if the present high power prices continue to the end California's
transition to a deregulated power market.

FERC chairman says deregulation should proceed

WASHINGTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday that California's
troubled power markets should force tough changes to make deregulation
work better, not end the movement.

Speaking at the commission's regular meeting, Hoecker and the three
other FERC commissioners reiterated their support for deregulation, but
said the experience in California, where prices spiked considerably for
residents of San Diego and on wholesale markets, must result in new
policies.

``I personally reject the notion that this is the beginning of the end
for deregulation,'' Hoecker said.

FERC conducted a hearing in San Diego on Tuesday, allowing discussion
from utilities, regulators and the public on what has become a
disastrous summer for California's power markets.

Under the terms of the deregulation of California's electric utility
industry, customers of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) subsidiary San
Diego Gas and Electric became the first in the nation to pay
market-based rates without a safety net.

Hoecker said now ``was the time to make tough decisions'' on retooling
deregulation laws to make them work better.

FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert said the problem is not just in
California, but also in New York and New England, where structural
problems with deregulation efforts have triggered market power, price,
supply and reliability concerns.

Many California and national lawmakers want FERC to declare that rates
set by suppliers this summer were not ``just and reasonable'' as
required under law.

Such a declaration could be followed by action to impose market
restrictions such as price caps across the western U.S..

Experts say such a move could lead to the demise of the California Power
Exchange, which was set up as part of the deregulationof the state's
power industry.

Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to
open retail electricity markets to competition.

A report on the California price spikes this summer by FERC
investigative staff is due to be received by the commission by Nov. 1.

I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.

The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining 
the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  
I look forward for your comments and advise.

Best regards

AI

Here are the salient features:
Meeting with Wade:
The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs 
to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and 
agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support 
from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what 
needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an 
effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) 
just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be "penny wise 
and pound foolish" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that 
Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is 
complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. 
GA Needs in India:
The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five 
areas: 
a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), 
b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, 
c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), 
e)  Government of India, and 
f)  EBS.  
The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following 
scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) 
Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of 
yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:

        Arbitration  Renegotiation
Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high
Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high
Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high
Government of India, and      high   high
EBS.         medium  medium

It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC 
seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the 
sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the 
best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any 
degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a 
risk-averse person shall take the "undetermined scenario" as equal to 
"renegotiation", while a risk-taker shall take the "undetermined"" as equal 
to arbitration.  

Personal:
It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in 
the "renegotiation" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a 
visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working 
under legal/commercial.  

Suggested Approach:
Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for 
the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the 
suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is "if there is 
renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full 
time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis".  

Caveat:
It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the 
suggested approach above one way or another.

		 Subject: India - Progress Report One

Rick: 
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and 
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting 
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from 
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing 
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support".  
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give 
Houston the final say.   

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA 
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and 
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, 
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit 
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams 
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation 
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the 
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is 
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market 
basis, but rather on accounting basis.  
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely 
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added 
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated 
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to 
complete phase II which we are refusing).  
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy 
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW 
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such 
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks 
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every 
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and 
solved.  
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest 
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them 
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned 
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the 
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the 
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the 
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment 
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the 
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of 
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there 
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for 
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to 
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you 
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards

Ken Blades and I had a 
conversation with Justin Williams yesterday about this ongoing saga (which 
has been ongoing a long time...).  Essentially here's where we are and why it 
is a good thing that United India has sued us in the London Court.  

In the early part of the dispute, we gave consideration to litigation vs. 
arbitration, but we could only sue UI in India, which was a bad option.

Several months ago, after lengthy settlement discussions with United India 
(UI) and reinsurers about DPC's DSU claim resulting from the first rotor 
problems, UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration under the policy.  The 
notice was curious because UI clearly disputed both liability and quantum; 
however, the policy's arbitration clause states that arbitration can only 
include issues of quantum.

Through a series of correspondence, we believe UI has agreed to arbitrate 
liability &amp; quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the 
arbitration.  (The cut through clause in the policy enables DPC to recover 
directly from the reinsurers).  It appears, however, (at least we speculate) 
that UI has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly, that while they 
have served DPC a notice of arbitration, the clause limits arbitration to 
quantum, not liability.  Hence UI's declaratory judgment action in the London 
Commercial Court to determine liability.  Now, this gives us an option we 
didn't have earlier: litigation in the London court since they have submitted 
to jurisdiction  or arbitration.  There are pros &amp; cons to both which we are 
discussing with Justin and Peter.

An interesting piece of the puzzle is that UI is now trying to realign the 
parties since DPC is the insured seeking recovery.    The reason UI wants to 
do this is because (i) it would put the burden of proof on DPC as claimant &amp; 
(ii) UI as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of 
proof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information 
DPC has. 
Pros of litigation: The London court is less likely to permit this 
realignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural 
matters of this type.  We also believe the London court will be cheaper (no 
cost of  3 arbitrators) and quicker, since there are statutory time lines.  
UI has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has, at every 
opportunity, slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything DPC 
proposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc.  Also, in 
the London court, there is a strong possibility DPC can get an advance 
security for attorneys' fees as the defendant, which is not possible in 
arbitration.
Downside of litigation:  It is less likely that DPC can litigate directly 
against the reinsurers for procedural reasons.  Furthermore, DPC could 
potentially end up in two proceedings: litigation to determine liability &amp; 
arbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive.   
Ken Blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior 
meeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario.  Until we see the 
document, however, we cannot determine whether the stipulation  is 
enforceable because of issues of authority etc.

The bottom line is, now that UI has sued us in London court, we have a choice 
we didn't have before.  We plan to obtain Ken's document re the stipulation, 
send a letter to UI and then see their reaction before we decide. Now that 
we've been served it just shortens our time limit to do this.  I'm inclined 
to go the litigation route, but I want to see that stipulation document first 
and discuss with Linklaters its value either as an enforceable agreement or 
its strength as evidence of quantum.  Call me if you have questions.  In the 
meantime I'll keep you informed.

Law changes needed for retroactive refunds

FERC'S Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority
_______________________________________________
Date: October 2, 2000 -


FERC Chairman James Hoecker (D) told a congressional panel that the 
commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against 
market power in a competitive environment. Hoecker also urged the congressmen 
to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility 
industry's transition to competition.

Hoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where 
some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after 
prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this 
summer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will 
consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk 
power markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that 
authority to do so retroactively.

"The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed," a FERC staffer says.

For its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the 
commission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market 
participants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA) 
-- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not 
consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is 
probably needed to see if the commission can do that.

"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, 
we will do so," Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept. 
21. "If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by 
revoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which 
we grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if 
refunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the 
commission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures 
with California (and other states)."

Currently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions 
made 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this 
case would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive 
ratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be 
changed.

"Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for 
any period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly 
problematic," Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert. 
"There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be 
unlawful and we would need legislation to do that."

The Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a 
mid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a 
severe energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker, 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Administrator Carol Browner.

Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both 
Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for 
failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson 
expressed his "disappointment" that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed 
that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.

"Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United 
States under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable 
service," Hoecker said. "The commission's open access rules are not binding 
on the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by 
entities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of 
public power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition 
in wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers 
and sellers."

Hoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and 
California's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives 
clear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do 
to solve the market problems.

"Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to 
obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices," Hoecker said. "Most 
critically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting 
electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition. 
Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate 
investment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of 
reliability which is crucial to the digital economy."

The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate 
regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability 
standards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the 
commission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources 
do not expect the bill to pass (see related story).

The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical 
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Thanks - Bob

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

Attached is a list of 210 reports from Altra GMS.  Please note that we may not
be using all of these reports.  If you need me to scale this down to those
currently being used, I will need to do a bit of analysis.  Many of the base

Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.  I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.

The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&amp;E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&amp;E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.

Steph - Leslie and I were just talking about this, and one thing we need to keep in mind is that any attempt to modify the PG&amp;E recall rights would almost certainly be opposed by the CPUC, especially if it was to benefit Enron.

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&amp;E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says "and if it so recalled (by PG&amp;E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&amp;E  service territory upon 24 hours notice."  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the "traditional rate making" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&amp;E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&amp;E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&amp;E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Stephanie

I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&amp;E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.

process. It was very hard for the courts to say scientific
inquiry could call into question a person who has direct
evidence to give."

challenges
to eyewitness testimony.

Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for the
communication.

Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores without
electricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lack
of electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked around
for a couple hours, covering some ground.

It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and
probably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spont
outdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,
and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of the
night).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the
stars were all out, as the city had gone dark.  Quite an experience.

More later,

Mark

with the shares now that they are directly held in the Corp. vault by Enron 
Brazil Power Holding XII.  I suspect that what we will do will be to just 
keep all the shares in XII and put them into the brokerage account, with some 
sales occurring over time going forward.  If this plan is agreed to, then 
early next week we can call BONY together with Morgan Stanley (our prime 
broker?) and work out a streamlined settlement procedure so that MS is 
assured that shares will be delivered.

Bruce Harris:

We do not need to set up a new Cayman entity to transfer the two certificates 
for 1.25M  to.  We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the 
shares in a Cayman entity.

I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those 
certificates to Enron South America LLC, the sole shareholder of EBPH XII.  
The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US 
tax treatment.   Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock, using 
the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good 
indicator of the fair market value.  For tax purposes, we will assume the 
value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a 
narrow band on either side of that value.    If the first 1.25M certificate 
is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC, we will need 
to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a 
valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the 
distribution..

If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis, EBPHXII will 
recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the 
distribution was made to Enron South America LLC. This would result in 
reporting a tax expense in 2000 and perhaps book income in 2001 if that sale 
takes place after the end of the year.   

If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less 
than the historical tax basis, the distribution to Enron South America LLC 
will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII.

If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies, the same 
valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on 
the sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated.  Distributing the shares to Enron 
South America LLC will be much easier.

Subject: Next steps with Copel shares


Robert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of 
Brazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next 
week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron 
vault.  

Here is what we now need to do:

1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it 
into three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately 
1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.

2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital 
split?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.

3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision 
(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel 
shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will 
go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would 
happen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about 
15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).

4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need 
to put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we 
will bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).

5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to 
establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate 
to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to 
figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for 
every small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these 
1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets 
(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 
months time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  

Robert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer 
shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M "unrestriction" with BONY and Skadden.
