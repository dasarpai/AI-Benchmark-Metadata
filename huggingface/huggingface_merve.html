on whom while so he gazd,\r\nHaving all satisfide their bloudy thurst,\r\nTheir bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,\r\nAnd bowels gushing forth: well worthy end\r\nOf such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;\r\nNow needeth him no lenger labour spend,\r\nHis foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.\r\n\r\nxxvii\r\nHis Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre\r\nApprocht in hast to greet his victorie,\r\nAnd said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,\r\nWho see your vanquisht foes before you lye:\r\nWell worthy be you of that Armorie,\r\nWherein ye have great glory wonne this day,\r\nAnd proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,\r\nYour first adventure: many such I pray,\r\nAnd henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.\r\n\r\nxxviii\r\nThen mounted he upon his Steede againe,\r\nAnd with the Lady backward sought to wend;\r\nThat path he kept, which beaten was most plame,\r\nNe ever would to any by-way bend,\r\nBut still did follow one unto the end,\r\nThe which at last out of the wood them brought.\r\nSo forward on his way (with God to frend)\r\nHe passed forth, and new adventure sought;\r\nLong way he travelled, before he heard of ought.\r\n\r\nxxix\r\nAt length they chaunst to meet upon the way\r\nAn aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,\r\nHis feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,\r\nAnd by his belt his booke he hanging had;\r\nSober he seemde, and very sagely sad,\r\nAnd to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,\r\nSimple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,\r\nAnd all the way he prayed, as he went,\r\nAnd often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.\r\n\r\nxxx\r\nHe faire the knight saluted, louting low,\r\nWho faire him quited, as that courteous was:\r\nAnd after asked him, if he did know\r\nOf straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.\r\nAh my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,\r\nSilly old man, that lives in hidden cell,\r\nBidding his beades all day for his trespas,\r\nTydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?\r\nWith holy father sits not with such things to mell.\r\n\r\nxxxi\r\nBut if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,\r\nAnd homebred evill ye desire to heare,\r\nOf a straunge man I can you tidings tell,\r\nThat wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.\r\nOf such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,\r\nAnd shall you well reward to shew the place,\r\nIn which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:\r\nFor to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,\r\nThat such a cursed creature lives so long a space.\r\n\r\nxxxii\r\nFar hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse\r\nHis dwelling is, by which no living wight\r\nMay ever passe, but thorough great distresse.\r\nNow (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,\r\nAnd well I wote, that of your later fight\r\nYe all forwearied be: for what so strong,\r\nBut wanting rest will also want of might?\r\nThe Sunne that measures heaven all day long,\r\nAt night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.\r\n\r\nxxxiii\r\nThen with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,\r\nAnd with new day new worke at once begin:\r\nUntroubled night they say gives counsell best.\r\nRight well Sir knight ye have advised bin,\r\n(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win\r\nIs wisely to advise: now day is spent;\r\nTherefore with me ye may take up your In\r\nFor this same night. The knight was well content:\r\nSo with that godly father to his home they went.\r\n\r\nxxxiv\r\nA little lowly Hermitage it was,\r\nDowne in a dale, hard by a forests side,\r\nFar from resort of people, that did pas\r\nIn travell to and froe: a little wyde\r\nThere was an holy Chappell edifyde,\r\nWherein the Hermite dewly wont to say\r\nHis holy things each morne and eventyde:\r\nThereby a Christall streame did gently play,\r\nWhich from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.\r\n\r\nxxxv\r\nArrived there, the little house they fill,\r\nNe looke for entertainement, where none was:\r\nRest is their feast, and all things at their will;\r\nThe noblest mind the best contentment has.\r\nWith faire discourse the evening so they pas:\r\nFor that old man of pleasing wordes had store,\r\nAnd well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;\r\nHe told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore\r\nHe strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.\r\n\r\nxxxvi\r\nThe drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,\r\nAnd the sad humour loading their eye liddes,\r\nAs messenger of Morpheus on them cast\r\nSweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.\r\nUnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:\r\nWhere when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,\r\nHe to his study goes, and there amiddes\r\nHis Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,\r\nHe seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.\r\n\r\nxxxvii\r\nThen choosing out few wordes most horrible,\r\n(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,\r\nWith which and other spelles like terrible,\r\nHe bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,\r\nAnd cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame\r\nOf highest God, the Lord of life and light;\r\nA bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name\r\nGreat Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,\r\nAt which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.\r\n\r\nxxxviii\r\nAnd forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred\r\nLegions of Sprights, the which like little flyes\r\nFluttring about his ever damned hed,\r\nA-waite whereto their service he applyes,\r\nTo aide his friends, or fray his enimies:\r\nOf those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,\r\nAnd fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;\r\nThe one of them he gave a message too,\r\nThe other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.\r\n\r\nxxxix\r\nHe making speedy way through spersed ayre,\r\nAnd through the world of waters wide and peepe,\r\nTo Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.\r\nAmid the bowels of the earth full steepe,\r\nAnd low, where dawning day doth never peepe,\r\nHis dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed\r\nDoth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe\r\nIn silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,\r\nWhiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.\r\n\r\nxl\r\nWhose double gates he findeth locked fast,\r\nThe one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,\r\nThe other all with silver overcast;\r\nAnd wakefull dogges before them farre do lye\r\nWatching to banish Care their enimy,\r\nWho oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.\r\nBy them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,\r\nAnd unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe\r\nIn drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.\r\n\r\nxli\r\nAnd more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\nA trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe\r\nAnd ever-drizling raine upon the loft,\r\nMixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\nOf swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:\r\nNo other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\r\nAs still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,\r\nMight there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,\r\nWrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.\r\n\r\nxlii\r\nThe messenger approching to him spake,\r\nBut his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:\r\nSo sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.\r\nThen rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,\r\nWhereat he gan to stretch: but he againe\r\nShooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.\r\nAs one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine\r\nIn tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,\r\nHe mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.\r\n\r\nxliii\r\nThe Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,\r\nAnd threatned unto him the dreaded name\r\nOf Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,\r\nAnd lifting up his lumpish head, with blame\r\nHalfe angry asked him, for what he came.\r\nHither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,\r\nHe that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,\r\nHe bids thee to him send for his intent\r\nA fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.\r\n\r\nxliv\r\nThe God obayde, and calling forth straight way\r\nA diverse dreame out of his prison darke,\r\nDelivered it to him, and downe did lay\r\nHis heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,\r\nWhose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.\r\nHe backe returning by the Yvorie dore,\r\nRemounted up as light as chearefull Larke,\r\nAnd on his litle winges the dreame he bore\r\nIn hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.\r\n\r\nxlv\r\nWho all this while with charmes and hidden artes,\r\nHad made a Lady of that other Spright,\r\nAnd fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes\r\nSo lively, and so like in all mens sight,\r\nThat weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:\r\nThe maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,\r\nWas nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:\r\nHer all in white he clad, and over it\r\nCast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.\r\n\r\nxlvi\r\nNow when that ydle dreame was to him brought,\r\nUnto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,\r\nWhere he slept soundly void of evill thought\r\nAnd with false shewes abuse his fantasy,\r\nIn sort as he him schooled privily:\r\nAnd that new creature borne without her dew,\r\nFull of the makers guile, with usage sly\r\nHe taught to imitate that Lady trew,\r\nWhose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.\r\n\r\nxlvii\r\nThus well instructed, to their worke they hast,\r\nAnd comming where the knight in slomber lay,\r\nThe one upon his hardy head him plast,\r\nAnd made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,\r\nThat nigh his manly hart did melt away,\r\nBathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:\r\nThen seemed him his Lady by him lay,\r\nAnd to him playnd, how that false winged boy,\r\nHer chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.\r\n\r\nxlviii\r\nAnd she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,\r\nFaire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring\r\nHer, whom he waking evermore did weene,\r\nTo be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring\r\nOn earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,\r\nNow a loose Leman to vile service bound:\r\nAnd eke the Graces seemed all to sing,\r\nHymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,\r\nWhile freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.\r\n\r\nxlix\r\nIn this great passion of

hyding her bayted hooke,\r\nAnd as halfe blushing offred him to kis,\r\nWith gentle blandishment and lovely looke,\r\nMost like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.\r\n\r\nl\r\nAll cleane

bloud, and for her tender youth.\r\n\r\nli\r\nAnd said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,\r\nShall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,\r\nAnd mightie causes wrought in heaven above,\r\nOr the blind God, that doth me thus amate,\r\nFor hoped love to winne me certaine hate?\r\nYet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.\r\nDie is my dew: yet rew my wretched state\r\nYou, whom my hard avenging destinie\r\nHath made judge of my life or death indifferently.\r\n\r\nlii\r\nYour owne deare sake forst me at first to leave\r\nMy Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares;\r\nHer swollen hart

and long teares.\r\nWhy Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?\r\nWhat frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?\r\n\r\nliii\r\nLove of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint\r\nLets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night\r\nIn secret anguish and unpittied plaint,\r\nWhiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.\r\nHer doubtfull words made that redoubted knight\r\nSuspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,\r\nHer fawning love with foule disdainefull spight\r\nHe would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,\r\nThat for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.\r\n\r\nliv\r\nAssure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;\r\nFor all so deare as life is to my hart,\r\nI deeme your love, and hold me to you bound;\r\nNe let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,\r\nWhere cause is none, but to your rest depart.\r\nNot all content, yet seemd she to appease\r\nHer mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,\r\nAnd fed with words, that could not chuse but please,\r\nSo slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.\r\n\r\nlv\r\nLong after lay he musing at her mood,\r\nMuch griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,\r\nFor whose defence he was to shed his blood.\r\nAt last dull wearinesse of former fight\r\nHaving yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,\r\nThat troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,\r\nWith bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:\r\nBut when he saw his labour all was vaine,\r\nWith that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.&quot;},&quot;poem

endlesse matrimony make,\r\nAnd let the roring Organs loudly play\r\nThe praises of the Lord in lively notes,\r\nThe whiles with hollow throates\r\nThe Choristers the joyous Antheme sing,\r\nThat al the woods may answere and their eccho ring.\r\n\r\nBehold whiles she before the altar stands\r\nHearing the holy priest that to her speakes\r\nAnd blesseth her with his two happy hands,\r\nHow the red roses flush up in her cheekes,\r\nAnd the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne,\r\nLike crimsin dyde in grayne,\r\nThat even th'Angels which continually,\r\nAbout the sacred Altare doe remaine,\r\nForget their service and about her fly,\r\nOfte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,\r\nThe more they on it stare.\r\nBut her sad eyes still fastened on the ground,\r\nAre governed with goodly modesty,\r\nThat suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,\r\nWhich may let in a little thought unsownd.\r\nWhy blush ye love to give to me your hand,\r\nThe pledge of all our band?\r\nSing

the longest day in all the yeare,\r\nAnd shortest night, when longest fitter weare:\r\nYet never day so long, but late would passe.\r\nRing ye the bels, to make it weare away,\r\nAnd bonefiers make all day,\r\nAnd daunce about them, and about them sing:\r\nThat all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAh when will this long weary day have end,\r\nAnd lende me leave to come unto my love?\r\nHow slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?\r\nHow slowly does sad Time his feathers move?\r\nHast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home\r\nWithin the Westerne fome:\r\nThy tyred steedes long

love\r\nThat all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,\r\nAnd guydest lovers through the nightes dread,\r\nHow chearefully thou lookest from above,\r\nAnd seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light\r\nAs joying in the sight\r\nOf these glad many which for joy doe sing,\r\nThat all the woods them answer and their echo ring.\r\n\r\nNow ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;\r\nEnough is

lay;\r\nLay her in lillies and in violets,\r\nAnd silken courteins over her display,\r\nAnd odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.\r\nBehold how goodly my faire love does ly\r\nIn proud humility;\r\nLike unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke,\r\nIn Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,\r\nTwixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,\r\nWith bathing in the Acidalian brooke.\r\nNow it is night, ye damsels may be gon,\r\nAnd leave my love alone,\r\nAnd leave likewise your former lay to sing:\r\nThe woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring.\r\n\r\nNow welcome night, thou night so long expected,\r\nThat long daies labour doest at last defray,\r\nAnd all my cares, which cruell love collected,\r\nHast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:\r\nSpread thy broad wing over my love and me,\r\nThat no man may us see,\r\nAnd in thy sable mantle us enwrap,\r\nFrom feare of perrill and foule horror free.\r\nLet no false treason seeke us to entrap,\r\nNor any dread disquiet once annoy\r\nThe safety of our joy:\r\nBut let the night be calme and quietsome,\r\nWithout tempestuous storms or sad afray:\r\nLyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,\r\nWhen he begot the great Tirynthian groome:\r\nOr lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,\r\nAnd begot Majesty.\r\nAnd let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:\r\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\r\n\r\nLet no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,\r\nBe heard all night within nor yet without:\r\nNe let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,\r\nBreake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.\r\nLet no deluding dreames, nor dreadful sights\r\nMake sudden sad affrights;\r\nNe let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,\r\nNe let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,\r\nNe let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,\r\nNe let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,\r\nFray us with things that be not.\r\nLet not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:\r\nNor the night Raven that still deadly yels,\r\nNor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,\r\nNor griesly vultures make us once affeard:\r\nNe let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking\r\nMake us to wish theyr choking.\r\nLet none of these theyr drery accents sing;\r\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\r\n\r\nBut let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,\r\nThat sacred peace may in assurance rayne,\r\nAnd tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,\r\nMay poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,\r\nThe whiles an hundred little winged loves,\r\nLike divers fethered doves,\r\nShall fly and flutter round about your bed,\r\nAnd in the secret darke, that none reproves,\r\nTheir prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread\r\nTo filch away sweet snatches of delight,\r\nConceald through covert night.\r\nYe sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will,\r\nFor greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,\r\nThinks more upon her paradise of joyes,\r\nThen what ye do, albe it good or ill.\r\nAll night therefore attend your merry play,\r\nFor it will soone be day:\r\nNow none doth hinder you, that say or sing,\r\nNe will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nWho is the same, which at my window peepes?\r\nOr whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,\r\nIs it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,\r\nBut walkes about high heaven al the night?\r\nO fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy\r\nMy love with me to spy:\r\nFor thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,\r\nAnd for a fleece of woll, which privily,\r\nThe Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,\r\nHis pleasures with thee wrought.\r\nTherefore to us be favorable now;\r\nAnd sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,\r\nAnd generation goodly dost enlarge,\r\nEncline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,\r\nAnd the chast wombe informe with timely seed,\r\nThat may our comfort breed:\r\nTill which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,\r\nNe let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAnd thou great Juno, which with awful might\r\nThe lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,\r\nAnd the religion of the faith first plight\r\nWith sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:\r\nAnd eeke for comfort often called art\r\nOf women in their smart,\r\nEternally bind thou this lovely band,\r\nAnd all thy blessings unto us impart.\r\nAnd thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,\r\nThe bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,\r\nWithout blemish or staine,\r\nAnd the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight\r\nWith secret ayde doest succour and supply,\r\nTill they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,\r\nSend us the timely fruit of this same night.\r\nAnd thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,\r\nGrant that it may so be.\r\nTil which we cease your further prayse to sing,\r\nNe any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAnd ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,\r\nIn which a thousand torches flaming bright\r\nDoe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,\r\nIn dreadful darknesse lend desired light;\r\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\r\nMore then we men can fayne,\r\nPoure out your blessing on us plentiously,\r\nAnd happy influence upon us raine,\r\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\r\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse,\r\nWith lasting happinesse,\r\nUp to your haughty pallaces may mount,\r\nAnd for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit\r\nMay heavenly tabernacles there inherit,\r\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the count.\r\nSo let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,\r\nAnd cease till then our tymely joyes to sing,\r\nThe woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring.\r\n\r\nSong made in lieu of many ornaments,\r\nWith which my love should duly have bene dect,\r\nWhich cutting off through hasty accidents,\r\nYe would not stay your dew

MARLOWE&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,\r\nIn view and opposite two cities stood,\r\nSea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;\r\nThe one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.\r\nAt Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,\r\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\r\nAnd offer'd as a dower his burning throne,\r\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\r\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\r\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\r\nHer wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,\r\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\r\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\r\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\r\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\r\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\r\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\r\nFrom whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;\r\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\r\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\r\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\r\nWhen 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\r\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\r\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\r\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\r\nWhich lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\r\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\r\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\r\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\r\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\r\nBuskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,\r\nAnd branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;\r\nWhere sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,\r\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\r\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\r\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\r\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,\r\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\r\nBut this is true; so like was one the other,\r\nAs he imagin'd Hero was his mother;\r\nAnd oftentimes into her bosom flew,\r\nAbout her naked neck his bare arms threw,\r\nAnd laid his childish head upon her breast,\r\nAnd with still panting rock'd there took his rest.\r\nSo lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,\r\nAs Nature wept, thinking she was undone,\r\nBecause she took more from her than she left,\r\nAnd of such wondrous beauty her bereft:\r\nTherefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,\r\nSince Hero's time hath half the world been black.\r\n\r\n         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young\r\n(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),\r\nDwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none\r\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\r\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\r\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\r\nWould have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece\r\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\r\nFair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;\r\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\r\nHis body was as straight as Circe's wand;\r\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\r\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\r\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\r\nThe white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,\r\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\r\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\r\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\r\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\r\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\r\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\r\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;\r\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\r\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\r\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\r\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\r\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\r\nEnamour'd of his beauty had he been.\r\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\r\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\r\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,\r\nWas mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.\r\nSome swore he was a maid in man's attire,\r\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\r\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\r\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\r\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\r\n\&quot;Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\r\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?\r\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\&quot;\r\n\r\n         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,\r\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\r\nRose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\r\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\r\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\r\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\r\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\r\nGlister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,\r\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd\r\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd\r\nAs if another Pha{\&quot;e}ton had got\r\nThe guidance of the sun's rich chariot.\r\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,\r\nAnd stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;\r\nFor like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,\r\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\r\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\r\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\r\nFrom Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,\r\nWhere, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,\r\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\r\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\r\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\r\nWretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,\r\nIncens'd with savage heat, gallop amain\r\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\r\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\r\nAnd all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.\r\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\r\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\r\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\r\nSo at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,\r\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\r\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\r\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\r\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\r\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\r\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\r\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\r\nPin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.\r\nOn this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!\r\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\r\nTo Venus' temple, where unhappily,\r\nAs after chanc'd, they did each other spy.\r\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\r\nThe walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,\r\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\r\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\r\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\r\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\r\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\r\nThe town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:\r\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\r\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\r\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\r\nWas Danae's statue in a brazen tower,\r\nJove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,\r\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\r\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\r\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\r\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\r\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\r\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\r\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\r\nThat now is turn'd into a cypress tree,\r\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\r\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\r\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,\r\nVail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\r\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\r\nThence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;\r\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\r\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\r\nTill with the fire that from his count'nance blazed\r\nRelenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:\r\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\r\n\r\n         It lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is over-rul'd by fate.\r\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\r\nWhat we behold is censur'd by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever lov'd, that lov'd not at

apply,\r\nOr other great one in the worldes eye,\r\nThat hath a zealous disposition\r\nTo God, and so to his religion.\r\nThere must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,\r\nSuch as no carpers may contrare reveal;\r\nFor each thing feigned ought more wary be.\r\nThere thou must walk in sober gravity,\r\nAnd seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:\r\nFast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,\r\nAnd unto every one do courtesy meek:\r\nThese looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,\r\nBut be thou sure one not to lack or long.\r\nAnd if thee list unto the court to throng,\r\nAnd there to hunt after the hoped prey,\r\nThen must thou thee dispose another way:\r\nFor there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,\r\nTo face, to forge, to scoff, to company,\r\nTo crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock\r\nOf thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.\r\nSo may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,\r\nUnless thou canst one conjure by device,\r\nOr cast a figure for a bishopric;\r\nAnd if one could, it were but a school trick.\r\nThese be the ways by which without reward\r\nLivings in court be gotten, though full hard;\r\nFor nothing there is done without a fee:\r\nThe courtier needs must recompensed be\r\nWith a benevolence, or have in gage\r\nThe primitias of your parsonage:\r\nScarce can a bishopric forpass them by,\r\nBut that it must be gelt in privity.\r\nDo not thou

twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:\r\nThou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,\r\nAnd he will care for all the rest to shift,\r\nBoth that the bishop may admit of thee,\r\nAnd that therein thou may'st maintained be.\r\nThis is the way for one that is unlearn'd\r\nLiving to get, and not to be discern'd.\r\nBut they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,\r\nFor learning sake to living them to raise;\r\nYet many eke of them (God wot) are driven\r\nT' accept a benefice in pieces riven.\r\nHow say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst\r\nUpon this common-place (though plain, not

thereby,\r\nWith goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,\r\nAs each had been a bride;\r\nAnd each one had a little wicker basket,\r\nMade of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,\r\nIn which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,\r\nAnd with fine fingers cropt full featously\r\nThe tender stalks on high.\r\nOf every sort, which in that meadow grew,\r\nThey gathered some; the violet pallid blue,\r\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\r\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\r\nWith store of vermeil roses,\r\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\r\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\r\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\r\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\r\nDid never whiter shew,\r\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\r\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\r\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\r\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\r\nSo purely white they were,\r\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\r\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\r\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\r\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\r\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\r\nThat shone as heaven's light,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\r\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\r\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\r\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\r\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\r\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\r\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\r\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\r\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\r\nFor sure they did not seem\r\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\r\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\r\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\r\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\r\nThe earth did fresh array,\r\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\r\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nThen forth they all out of their baskets drew\r\nGreat store of flowers, the honour of the field,\r\nThat to the sense did fragrant odours yield,\r\nAll which upon those goodly birds they threw,\r\nAnd all the waves did strew,\r\nThat like old Peneus' waters they did seem,\r\nWhen down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,\r\nScattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,\r\nThat they appear through lilies' plenteous store,\r\nLike a bride's chamber floor.\r\nTwo of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,\r\nOf freshest flowers which in that mead they found,\r\nThe which presenting all in trim array,\r\nTheir snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,\r\nWhilst one did sing this lay,\r\nPrepared against that day,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\n'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,\r\nAnd heaven's glory, whom this happy hour\r\nDoth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,\r\nJoy may you have and gentle heart's content\r\nOf your love's complement:\r\nAnd let fair Venus, that is queen of love,\r\nWith her heart-quelling son upon you smile,\r\nWhose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove\r\nAll love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile\r\nFor ever to assoil.\r\nLet endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,\r\nAnd blessed plenty wait upon your board,\r\nAnd let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,\r\nThat fruitful issue may to you afford,\r\nWhich may your foes confound,\r\nAnd make your joys redound\r\nUpon your bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'\r\n\r\nSo ended she; and all the rest around\r\nTo her redoubled that her undersong,\r\nWhich said their bridal day should not be long.\r\nAnd gentle echo from the neighbour ground\r\nTheir accents did resound.\r\nSo forth those joyous birds did pass along,\r\nAdown the Lee, that to them murmured low,\r\nAs he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,\r\nYet did by signs his glad affection show,\r\nMaking his stream run slow.\r\nAnd all the fowl which in his flood did dwell\r\nGan flock about these twain, that did excel\r\nThe rest so far as Cynthia doth shend\r\nThe lesser stars. So they, enranged well,\r\nDid on those two attend,\r\nAnd their best service lend,\r\nAgainst their wedding day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nAt length they all to merry London came,\r\nTo merry London, my most kindly nurse,\r\nThat to me gave this life's first native source;\r\nThough from another place I take my name,\r\nAn house of ancient fame.\r\nThere when they came, whereas those bricky towers,\r\nThe which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,\r\nWhere now the studious lawyers have their bowers\r\nThere whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,\r\nTill they decayed through pride:\r\nNext whereunto there stands a stately place,\r\nWhere oft I gained gifts and goodly grace\r\nOf that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,\r\nWhose want too well now feels my friendless case.\r\nBut ah, here fits not well\r\nOld woes but joys to tell\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nYet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,\r\nGreat England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,\r\nWhose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,\r\nAnd Hercules' two pillars standing near\r\nDid make to quake and fear:\r\nFair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,\r\nThat fillest England with thy triumph's fame,\r\nJoy have thou of thy noble victory,\r\nAnd endless happiness of thine own name\r\nThat promiseth the same:\r\nThat through thy prowess and victorious arms,\r\nThy country may be freed from foreign harms;\r\nAnd great Elisa's glorious name may ring\r\nThrough all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,\r\nWhich some brave Muse may sing\r\nTo ages following,\r\nUpon the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nFrom those high towers this noble lord issuing,\r\nLike radiant Hesper when his golden hair\r\nIn th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,\r\nDescended to the river's open viewing,\r\nWith a great train ensuing.\r\nAbove the rest were goodly to be seen\r\nTwo gentle knights of lovely face and feature\r\nBeseeming well the bower of any queen,\r\nWith gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,\r\nFit for so goodly stature;\r\nThat like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,\r\nWhich deck the baldric of the heavens bright.\r\nThey two forth pacing to the river's side,\r\nReceived those two fair birds, their love's delight;\r\nWhich, at th' appointed tide,\r\nEach one did make his bride\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.&quot;},&quot;poem

fable is inverted, and far more\r\nA block afflicts, now, than a stork before.\r\nStorms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us;\r\nIn calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus.\r\nAs steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were,\r\nSmooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there,\r\nThe sea is now; and, as the isles which we\r\nSeek, when we can move, our ships rooted be.\r\nAs water did in storms, now pitch runs out;\r\nAs lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout.\r\nAnd all our beauty, and our trim, decays,\r\nLike courts removing, or like ended plays.\r\nThe fighting-place now seamen's rags supply;\r\nAnd all the tackling is a frippery.\r\nNo use of lanthorns; and in one place lay\r\nFeathers and dust, to-day and yesterday.\r\nEarth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are,\r\nHave no more wind than the upper vault of air.\r\nWe can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover,\r\nBut meteor-like, save that we move not, hover.\r\nOnly the calenture together draws\r\nDear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws;\r\nAnd on the hatches, as on altars, lies\r\nEach one, his own priest, and own sacrifice.\r\nWho live, that miracle do multiply,\r\nWhere walkers in hot ovens do not die.\r\nIf in despite of these we swim, that hath\r\nNo more refreshing than our brimstone bath;\r\nBut from the sea into the ship we turn,\r\nLike parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn.\r\nLike Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff,\r\nOr like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off,\r\nLanguish our ships. Now as a myriad\r\nOf ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade,\r\nThe crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips,\r\nMight brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships.\r\nWhether a rotten state, and hope of gain,\r\nOr to disuse me from the queasy pain\r\nOf being belov'd and loving, or the thirst\r\nOf honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first,\r\nI lose my end; for here, as well as I,\r\nA desperate may live, and a coward die.\r\nStag, dog, and all which from or towards flies,\r\nIs paid with life or prey, or doing dies.\r\nFate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay\r\nA scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray.\r\nHe that at sea prays for more wind, as well\r\nUnder the poles may beg cold, heat in hell.\r\nWhat are we then? How little more, alas,\r\nIs man now, than before he was? He was\r\nNothing; for us, we are for nothing fit;\r\nChance, or ourselves, still disproportion it.\r\nWe have no power, no will, no sense; I lie,\r\nI should not then thus feel this misery.&quot;},&quot;poem name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Calm&quot;},&quot;age&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Renaissance&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Nature&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:51,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;JOHN DONNE&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Where, like a pillow on a bed\r\n         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest\r\nThe violet's reclining head,\r\n         Sat we two, one another's best.\r\nOur hands were firmly cemented\r\n         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;\r\nOur eye-beams twisted, and did thread\r\n         Our eyes upon one double string;\r\nSo to'intergraft our hands, as yet\r\n         Was all the means to make us one,\r\nAnd pictures in our eyes to get\r\n         Was all our propagation.\r\nAs 'twixt two equal armies fate\r\n         Suspends uncertain victory,\r\nOur souls (which to advance their state\r\n         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.\r\nAnd whilst our souls negotiate there,\r\n         We like sepulchral statues lay;\r\nAll day, the same our postures were,\r\n         And we said nothing, all the day.\r\nIf any, so by love refin'd\r\n         That he soul's language understood,\r\nAnd by good love were grown all mind,\r\n         Within convenient distance stood,\r\nHe (though he knew not which soul spake,\r\n         Because both meant, both spake the same)\r\nMight thence a new concoction take\r\n         And part far purer than he came.\r\nThis ecstasy doth unperplex,\r\n         We said, and tell us what we love;\r\nWe see by this it was not sex,\r\n         We see we saw not what did move;\r\nBut as all several souls contain\r\n         Mixture of things, they know not what,\r\nLove these mix'd souls doth mix again\r\n         And makes both one, each this and that.\r\nA single violet transplant,\r\n         The strength, the colour, and the size,\r\n(All which before was poor and scant)\r\n         Redoubles still, and multiplies.\r\nWhen love with one another so\r\n         Interinanimates two souls,\r\nThat abler soul, which thence doth flow,\r\n         Defects of loneliness controls.\r\nWe then, who are this new soul, know\r\n         Of what we are compos'd and made,\r\nFor th' atomies of which we grow\r\n         Are souls, whom no change can invade.\r\nBut oh alas, so long, so far,\r\n         Our bodies why do we forbear?\r\nThey'are ours, though they'are not we; we are\r\n         The intelligences, they the spheres.\r\nWe owe them thanks, because they thus\r\n         Did us, to us, at first convey,\r\nYielded their senses' force to us,\r\n         Nor are dross to us, but allay.\r\nOn man heaven's influence works not so,\r\n         But that it first imprints the air;\r\nSo soul into the soul may flow,\r\n            Though it to body first repair.\r\nAs our blood labors to beget\r\n         Spirits, as like souls as it can,\r\nBecause such fingers need to knit\r\n         That subtle knot which makes us man,\r\nSo must pure lovers' souls descend\r\n         T' affections, and to faculties,\r\nWhich sense may reach and apprehend,\r\n         Else a great prince in prison lies.\r\nTo'our bodies turn we then, that so\r\n         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;\r\nLove's mysteries in souls do grow,\r\n         But yet the body is his book.\r\nAnd if some lover, such as we,\r\n         Have heard this dialogue of one,\r\nLet him still mark us, he shall see\r\n         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.&quot;},&quot;poem name&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Ecstasy&quot;},&quot;age&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Renaissance&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Nature&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:52,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;JOHN DONNE&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace\r\n         As I have seen in one autumnal face.\r\nYoung beauties force our love, and that's a rape,\r\n         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.\r\nIf 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;\r\n         Affection here takes reverence's name.\r\nWere her first years the golden age?

the violet pallid blue,\r\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\r\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\r\nWith store of vermeil roses,\r\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\r\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\r\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\r\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\r\nDid never whiter shew,\r\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\r\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\r\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\r\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\r\nSo purely white they were,\r\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\r\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\r\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\r\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\r\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\r\nThat shone as heaven's light,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\r\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\r\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\r\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\r\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\r\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\r\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\r\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\r\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\r\nFor sure they did not seem\r\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\r\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\r\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\r\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\r\nThe earth did fresh array,\r\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\r\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nThen forth they all out of their baskets drew\r\nGreat store of flowers, the honour of the field,\r\nThat to the sense did fragrant odours yield,\r\nAll which upon those goodly birds they threw,\r\nAnd all the waves did strew,\r\nThat like old Peneus' waters they did seem,\r\nWhen down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,\r\nScattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,\r\nThat they appear through lilies' plenteous store,\r\nLike a bride's chamber floor.\r\nTwo of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,\r\nOf freshest flowers which in that mead they found,\r\nThe which presenting all in trim array,\r\nTheir snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,\r\nWhilst one did sing this lay,\r\nPrepared against that day,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\n'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,\r\nAnd heaven's glory, whom this happy hour\r\nDoth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,\r\nJoy may you have and gentle heart's content\r\nOf your love's complement:\r\nAnd let fair Venus, that is queen of love,\r\nWith her heart-quelling son upon you smile,\r\nWhose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove\r\nAll love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile\r\nFor ever to assoil.\r\nLet endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,\r\nAnd blessed plenty wait upon your board,\r\nAnd let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,\r\nThat fruitful issue may to you afford,\r\nWhich may your foes confound,\r\nAnd make your joys redound\r\nUpon your bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'\r\n\r\nSo ended she; and all the rest around\r\nTo her redoubled that her undersong,\r\nWhich said their bridal day should not be long.\r\nAnd gentle echo from the neighbour ground\r\nTheir accents did resound.\r\nSo forth those joyous birds did pass along,\r\nAdown the Lee, that to them murmured low,\r\nAs he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,\r\nYet did by signs his glad affection show,\r\nMaking his stream run slow.\r\nAnd all the fowl which in his flood did dwell\r\nGan flock about these twain, that did excel\r\nThe rest so far as Cynthia doth shend\r\nThe lesser stars. So they, enranged well,\r\nDid on those two attend,\r\nAnd their best service lend,\r\nAgainst their wedding day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nAt length they all to merry London came,\r\nTo merry London, my most kindly nurse,\r\nThat to me gave this life's first native source;\r\nThough from another place I take my name,\r\nAn house of ancient fame.\r\nThere when they came, whereas those bricky towers,\r\nThe which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,\r\nWhere now the studious lawyers have their bowers\r\nThere whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,\r\nTill they decayed through pride:\r\nNext whereunto there stands a stately place,\r\nWhere oft I gained gifts and goodly grace\r\nOf that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,\r\nWhose want too well now feels my friendless case.\r\nBut ah, here fits not well\r\nOld woes but joys to tell\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nYet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,\r\nGreat England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,\r\nWhose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,\r\nAnd Hercules' two pillars standing near\r\nDid make to quake and fear:\r\nFair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,\r\nThat fillest England with thy triumph's fame,\r\nJoy have thou of thy noble victory,\r\nAnd endless happiness of thine own name\r\nThat promiseth the same:\r\nThat through thy prowess and victorious arms,\r\nThy country may be freed from foreign harms;\r\nAnd great Elisa's glorious name may ring\r\nThrough all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,\r\nWhich some brave Muse may sing\r\nTo ages following,\r\nUpon the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nFrom those high towers this noble lord issuing,\r\nLike radiant Hesper when his golden hair\r\nIn th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,\r\nDescended to the river's open viewing,\r\nWith a great train ensuing.\r\nAbove the rest were goodly to be seen\r\nTwo gentle knights of lovely face and feature\r\nBeseeming well the bower of any queen,\r\nWith gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,\r\nFit for so goodly stature;\r\nThat like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,\r\nWhich deck the baldric of the heavens bright.\r\nThey two forth pacing to the river's side,\r\nReceived those two fair birds, their love's delight;\r\nWhich, at th' appointed tide,\r\nEach one did make his bride\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run

expense.\r\n\r\n     Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes,\r\nMy will, my ware, and all that was.\r\nI can no mo delays devise,\r\nBut welcome pain, let pleasure pass;\r\nWith lullaby now take your

On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.

From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feather'd king;
Keep the obsequy so strict.

Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.

And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender mak'st
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead;
Phoenix and the Turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they lov'd, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the Turtle saw his right
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded;

That it cried, "How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love has reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain."

Whereupon it made this threne
To the Phoenix and the Dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene:

                 threnos

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.

Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
And the Turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem but cannot be;
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</span></div></div>

Am now enforst a far unfitter taske,
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;
Whose prayses having slept in silence long,
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song.
Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine,
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will,
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill,
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,
That I must rue his undeserved wrong:
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove,
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove,
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart,
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd,
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright,
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine,
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine,
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,
The argument of mine afflicted stile:
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.

i
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.

ii
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,
And dead as living ever him ador'd:
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had:
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.

iii
Upon a great adventure he was bond,
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,
To winne him worship, and her grace to have,
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.

iv
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,
And over all a blacke stole she did throw,
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.

v
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,
She was in life and every vertuous lore,
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,
And all the world in their subjection held;
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.

vi
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,
That lasie seemd in being ever last,
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.

vii
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,
A shadie grove not far away they spide,
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,
Not perceable with power of any starre:
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.

viii
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.

ix
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round,
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.

x
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,
They cannot find that path, which first was showne,
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.

xi
At last resolving forward still to fare,
Till that some end they finde or in or out,
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,
And like to lead the labyrinth about;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.

xii
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,
And perill without show: therefore your stroke
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade:
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.

xiii
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place
I better wot then you, though now too late
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.

xiv
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,
But forth unto the darksome hole he went,
And looked in: his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.

xv
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,
Her huge long taile her den all overspred,
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.

xvi
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;
For light she hated as the deadly bale,
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.

xvii
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning backe, and forced her to stay:
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,
And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.

xviii
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground:
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine
All suddenly about his body wound,
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.

xix
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.
That when he heard, in great perplexitie,
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,
And knitting all his force got one hand free,
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.

xx
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.

xxi
As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:
But when his later spring gins to avale,
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.

xxii
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke,
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.

xxiii
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide,
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,
All striving to infixe their feeble stings,
That from their noyance he no where can rest,
But with his clownish hands their tender wings
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.

xxiv
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,
Then of the certaine perill he stood in,
Halfe furious unto his foe he came,
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;
And strooke at her with more then manly force,
That from her body full of filthie sin
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.

xxv
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,
Gathred themselves about her body round,
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,
And sucked up their dying mothers blood,
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.

xxvi
That detestable sight him much amazde,
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.

xxvii
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:
Well worthy be you of that Armorie,
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day,
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,
Your first adventure: many such I pray,
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.

xxviii
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;
That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,
Ne ever would to any by-way bend,
But still did follow one unto the end,
The which at last out of the wood them brought.
So forward on his way (with God to frend)
He passed forth, and new adventure sought;
Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.

xxix
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,
And all the way he prayed, as he went,
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.

xxx
He faire the knight saluted, louting low,
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:
And after asked him, if he did know
Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.

xxxi
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,
And homebred evill ye desire to heare,
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,
And shall you well reward to shew the place,
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.

xxxii
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse
His dwelling is, by which no living wight
May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,
And well I wote, that of your later fight
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,
But wanting rest will also want of might?
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long,
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.

xxxiii
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,
And with new day new worke at once begin:
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best.
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;
Therefore with me ye may take up your In
For this same night. The knight was well content:
So with that godly father to his home they went.

xxxiv
A little lowly Hermitage it was,
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,
Far from resort of people, that did pas
In travell to and froe: a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde,
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say
His holy things each morne and eventyde:
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.

xxxv
Arrived there, the little house they fill,
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;
The noblest mind the best contentment has.
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;
He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.

xxxvi
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,
He to his study goes, and there amiddes
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.

xxxvii
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,
With which and other spelles like terrible,
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.

xxxviii
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes
Fluttring about his ever damned hed,
A-waite whereto their service he applyes,
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;
The one of them he gave a message too,
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.

xxxix
He making speedy way through spersed ayre,
And through the world of waters wide and peepe,
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,
And low, where dawning day doth never peepe,
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.

xl
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,
The other all with silver overcast;
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye
Watching to banish Care their enimy,
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.

xli
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.

xlii
The messenger approching to him spake,
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine
In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.

xliii
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,
And threatned unto him the dreaded name
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,
And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,
He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.

xliv
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke,
Delivered it to him, and downe did lay
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore,
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke,
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.

xlv
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes
So lively, and so like in all mens sight,
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:
Her all in white he clad, and over it
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.

xlvi
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,
In sort as he him schooled privily:
And that new creature borne without her dew,
Full of the makers guile, with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady trew,
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.

xlvii
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,
And comming where the knight in slomber lay,
The one upon his hardy head him plast,
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,
That nigh his manly hart did melt away,
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.

xlviii
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring
Her, whom he waking evermore did weene,
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,
Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.

xlix
In this great passion of unwonted lust,
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,
He started up, as seeming to mistrust
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:
Lo there before his face his Lady is,
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke,
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.

l
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise
To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,
Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth,
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.

li
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above,
Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate?
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state
You, whom my hard avenging destinie
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently.

lii
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave
My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares;
Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave,
And then againe begun, My weaker yeares
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:
Let me not dye in languor and long teares.
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?

liii
Love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint
Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night
In secret anguish and unpittied plaint,
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight
Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight
He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.

liv
Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;
For all so deare as life is to my hart,
I deeme your love, and hold me to you bound;
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,
Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.

lv
Long after lay he musing at her mood,
Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.
At last dull wearinesse of former fight
Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:
But when he saw his labour all was vaine,
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.</span></div></div>

Never halfe the payne

The tearys downe hayled;
But nothinge it avayled

It can not be exprest
My sorowfull hevynesse,
But all without redresse;
For within that stounde,
Halfe slumbrynge, in a swounde
I fell downe to the grounde.

Towarde the cloudy skyes:
But whan I dyd beholde
My sparow dead and colde,
No creatuer but that wolde
Have rewed upon me,
To behold and se
What hevynesse dyd me pange;
Wherewith my handes I wrange,
That my senaws cracked,
As though I had ben racked,
So payned and so strayned,
That no lyfe wellnye remayned.

I syghed and I sobbed,
For that I was robbed
Of my sparowes lyfe.
O mayden, wydow, and wyfe,
Of what estate ye be,
Of hye or lowe degre,
Great sorowe than ye myght se,

For Phylyp Sparowes sake!
So fervently I shake,

So urgently I am brought

Upon the lowly ground affixed are.
Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,
But blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,
So farre from being proud.
Nathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses sing,

Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte,
Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,
Her paps lyke lyllies budded,
Her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre,
And all her body like a pallace fayre,
Ascending uppe with many a stately stayre,
To honors seat and chastities sweet bowre.
Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,
Upon her so to gaze,
Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,
To which the woods did answer and your eccho ring.

But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,
The inward beauty of her lively spright,
Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree,
Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,
And stand astonisht lyke to those which red
Medusaes mazeful hed.
There dwels sweet love and constant chastity,
Unspotted fayth and comely womenhed,
Regard of honour and mild modesty,
There vertue raynes as Queene in royal throne,
And giveth lawes alone.
The which the base affections doe obay,
And yeeld theyr services unto her will,
Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may
Thereto approch to tempt her mind to ill.
Had ye once seene these her celestial threasures,
And unrevealed pleasures,
Then would ye wonder and her prayses sing,
That al the woods should answer and your eccho ring.

Open the temple gates unto my love,
Open them wide that she may enter in,
And all the postes adorne as doth behove,
And all the pillours deck with girlands trim,
For to recyve this Saynt with honour dew,
That commeth in to you.
With trembling steps and humble reverence,
She commeth in, before th'almighties vew:
Of her ye virgins learne obedience,
When so ye come into those holy places,
To humble your proud faces;
Bring her up to th'high altar that she may,
The sacred ceremonies there partake,
The which do endlesse matrimony make,
And let the roring Organs loudly play
The praises of the Lord in lively notes,
The whiles with hollow throates
The Choristers the joyous Antheme sing,
That al the woods may answere and their eccho ring.

Behold whiles she before the altar stands
Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes
And blesseth her with his two happy hands,
How the red roses flush up in her cheekes,
And the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne,
Like crimsin dyde in grayne,
That even th'Angels which continually,
About the sacred Altare doe remaine,
Forget their service and about her fly,
Ofte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,
The more they on it stare.
But her sad eyes still fastened on the ground,
Are governed with goodly modesty,
That suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,
Which may let in a little thought unsownd.
Why blush ye love to give to me your hand,
The pledge of all our band?
Sing ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,
That all the woods may answere and your eccho ring.

Now al is done; bring home the bride againe,
Bring home the triumph of our victory,
Bring home with you the glory of her gaine,
With joyance bring her and with jollity.
Never had man more joyfull day then this,
Whom heaven would heape with blis.
Make feast therefore now all this live long day,
This day for ever to me holy is,
Poure out the wine without restraint or stay,
Poure not by cups, but by the belly full,
Poure out to all that wull,
And sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,
That they may sweat, and drunken be withall.
Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,
And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine,
And let the Graces daunce unto the rest;
For they can doo it best:
The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,
To which the woods shal answer and theyr eccho ring.

Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,
And leave your wonted labors for this day:
This day is holy; doe ye write it downe,
That ye for ever it remember may.
This day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,
With Barnaby the bright,
From whence declining daily by degrees,
He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,
When once the Crab behind his back he sees.
But for this time it ill ordained was,
To chose the longest day in all the yeare,
And shortest night, when longest fitter weare:
Yet never day so long, but late would passe.
Ring ye the bels, to make it weare away,
And bonefiers make all day,
And daunce about them, and about them sing:
That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.

Ah when will this long weary day have end,
And lende me leave to come unto my love?
How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?
How slowly does sad Time his feathers move?
Hast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home
Within the Westerne fome:
Thy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.
Long though it be, at last I see it gloome,
And the bright evening star with golden creast
Appeare out of the East.
Fayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of love
That all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,
And guydest lovers through the nightes dread,
How chearefully thou lookest from above,
And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light
As joying in the sight
Of these glad many which for joy doe sing,
That all the woods them answer and their echo ring.

Now ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;
Enough is it, that all the day was youres:
Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast:
Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.
Now night is come, now soone her disaray,
And in her bed her lay;
Lay her in lillies and in violets,
And silken courteins over her display,
And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.
Behold how goodly my faire love does ly
In proud humility;
Like unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke,
In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,
Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,
With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.
Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,
And leave my love alone,
And leave likewise your former lay to sing:
The woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring.

Now welcome night, thou night so long expected,
That long daies labour doest at last defray,
And all my cares, which cruell love collected,
Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:
Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,
That no man may us see,
And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,
From feare of perrill and foule horror free.
Let no false treason seeke us to entrap,
Nor any dread disquiet once annoy
The safety of our joy:
But let the night be calme and quietsome,
Without tempestuous storms or sad afray:
Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,
When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:
Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,
And begot Majesty.
And let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.

Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,
Be heard all night within nor yet without:
Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,
Breake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.
Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadful sights
Make sudden sad affrights;
Ne let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,
Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,
Ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,
Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,
Fray us with things that be not.
Let not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:
Nor the night Raven that still deadly yels,
Nor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,
Nor griesly vultures make us once affeard:
Ne let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking
Make us to wish theyr choking.
Let none of these theyr drery accents sing;
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.

But let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,
That sacred peace may in assurance rayne,
And tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,
May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,
The whiles an hundred little winged loves,
Like divers fethered doves,
Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,
And in the secret darke, that none reproves,
Their prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread
To filch away sweet snatches of delight,
Conceald through covert night.
Ye sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will,
For greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,
Thinks more upon her paradise of joyes,
Then what ye do, albe it good or ill.
All night therefore attend your merry play,
For it will soone be day:
Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing,
Ne will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.

Who is the same, which at my window peepes?
Or whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,
Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,
But walkes about high heaven al the night?
O fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy
My love with me to spy:
For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,
And for a fleece of woll, which privily,
The Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,
His pleasures with thee wrought.
Therefore to us be favorable now;
And sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,
And generation goodly dost enlarge,
Encline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,
And the chast wombe informe with timely seed,
That may our comfort breed:
Till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,
Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.

And thou great Juno, which with awful might
The lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,
And the religion of the faith first plight
With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:
And eeke for comfort often called art
Of women in their smart,
Eternally bind thou this lovely band,
And all thy blessings unto us impart.
And thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,
The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,
Without blemish or staine,
And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight
With secret ayde doest succour and supply,
Till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,
Send us the timely fruit of this same night.
And thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,
Grant that it may so be.
Til which we cease your further prayse to sing,
Ne any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.

And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,
In which a thousand torches flaming bright
Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,
In dreadful darknesse lend desired light;
And all ye powers which in the same remayne,
More then we men can fayne,
Poure out your blessing on us plentiously,
And happy influence upon us raine,
That we may raise a large posterity,
Which from the earth, which they may long possesse,
With lasting happinesse,
Up to your haughty pallaces may mount,
And for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit
May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,
Of blessed Saints for to increase the count.
So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,
And cease till then our tymely joyes to sing,
The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring.

Song made in lieu of many ornaments,
With which my love should duly have bene dect,
Which cutting off through hasty accidents,
Ye would not stay your dew time to expect,
But promist both to recompens,
Be unto her a goodly ornament,
And for short time an endlesse moniment.</span></div></div>

In view and opposite two cities stood,
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.
The outside of her garments were of lawn,
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,
Where Venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;
And there for honey bees have sought in vain,
And beat from thence, have lighted there again.
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight
To play upon those hands, they were so white.
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold:
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,
And looking in her face, was strooken blind.
But this is true; so like was one the other,
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;
And oftentimes into her bosom flew,
About her naked neck his bare arms threw,
And laid his childish head upon her breast,
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,
Because she took more from her than she left,
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.

         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young
(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,
So was his neck in touching, and surpast
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back; but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his
That leapt into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,
For in his looks were all that men desire,
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,
A brow for love to banquet royally;
And such as knew he was a man, would say,
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall."

         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves; such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival;
For every street, like to a firmament,
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,
Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd
As if another Pha{"e}ton had got
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.
But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,
So was her beauty to the standers-by;
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,
Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.
And as in fury of a dreadful fight,
Their fellows being slain or put to flight,
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.
There might you see one sigh, another rage,
And some, their violent passions to assuage,
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,
For faithful love will never turn to hate.
And many, seeing great princes were denied,
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower
To Venus' temple, where unhappily,
As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.
So fair a church as this had Venus none:
The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head
A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,
Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:
For know, that underneath this radiant flower
Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,
To dally with Idalian Ganimed,
And for his love Europa bellowing loud,
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.
And in the midst a silver altar stood:
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;
And modestly they opened as she rose.
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;
And thus Leander was enamoured.
Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.

         It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
When two are stript, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows, let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?</span></div></div>

The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,
And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,
How to a benefice he might aspire.
"Marry, there" (said the priest) "is art indeed:
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;
For that the ground-work is, and end of all,
How to obtain a beneficial.
First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise
Yourself attired, as you can devise,
Then to some nobleman yourself apply,
Or other great one in the worldes eye,
That hath a zealous disposition
To God, and so to his religion.
There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.
There thou must walk in sober gravity,
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:
Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,
And unto every one do courtesy meek:
These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.
And if thee list unto the court to throng,
And there to hunt after the hoped prey,
Then must thou thee dispose another way:
For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,
To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,
To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock
Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.
So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,
Unless thou canst one conjure by device,
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;
And if one could, it were but a school trick.
These be the ways by which without reward
Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;
For nothing there is done without a fee:
The courtier needs must recompensed be
With a benevolence, or have in gage
The primitias of your parsonage:
Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,
But that it must be gelt in privity.
Do not thou therefore seek a living there,
But of more private persons seek elsewhere,
Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.
For some good gentleman, that hath the right
Unto his church for to present a wight,
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;
That if the living yearly do arise
To forty pound, that then his youngest son
Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:
Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,
And he will care for all the rest to shift,
Both that the bishop may admit of thee,
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd
Living to get, and not to be discern'd.
But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,
For learning sake to living them to raise;
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.
How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst
Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.
Needs any more to learn to get a living?"

"Now sure, and by my halidom," (quoth he)
"Ye a great master are in your degree:
Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,
And do not doubt but duly to incline
My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear."
The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:
So parted they, as either's way them led.
But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,
Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,
And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;
And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;
But, ere long time had passed, they so ill
Did order their affairs, that th' evil will
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;
Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,
How foully they their offices abus'd,
And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,
That pursuivants he often for them sent;
But they neglected his commandement.
So long persisted obstinate and bold,
Till at the length he published to hold
A visitation, and them cited thether:
Then was high time their wits about to geather.
What did they then, but made a composition
With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,
To whom their living they resigned quite
For a few pence, and ran away by night.</span></div></div>

Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,
The little daisy, that at evening closes,
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,
With store of vermeil roses,
To deck their bridegrooms' posies
Against the bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,
Did never whiter shew,
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.
So purely white they were,
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,
And mar their beauties bright,
That shone as heaven's light,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,
As they came floating on the crystal flood.
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,
Their wondering eyes to fill.
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed,
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array,
So fresh they seemed as day,
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,
And all the waves did strew,
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,
Like a bride's chamber floor.
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,
The which presenting all in trim array,
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,
Whilst one did sing this lay,
Prepared against that day,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content
Of your love's complement:
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile
For ever to assoil.
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,
That fruitful issue may to you afford,
Which may your foes confound,
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'

So ended she; and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong,
Which said their bridal day should not be long.
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground
Their accents did resound.
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,
Making his stream run slow.
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,
Did on those two attend,
And their best service lend,
Against their wedding day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

At length they all to merry London came,
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,
That to me gave this life's first native source;
Though from another place I take my name,
An house of ancient fame.
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride:
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.
But ah, here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,
And Hercules' two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear:
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same:
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,
Which some brave Muse may sing
To ages following,
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

From those high towers this noble lord issuing,
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,
Descended to the river's open viewing,
With a great train ensuing.
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,
Fit for so goodly stature;
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.
They two forth pacing to the river's side,
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;
Which, at th' appointed tide,
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.</span></div></div>

Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

HOBBINOLL
Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,
But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,
Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:
He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.

Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.

THENOT
What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?
And hath he skill to make so excellent,
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?

HOBBINOLL
Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.
Whilome on him was all my care and joye,
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.

But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.

THENOT
But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,
I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:
The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.

HOBBINOLL
Contented I: then will I singe his laye
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.

Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke
         doe bathe your brest,
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
         at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
         Helpe me to blaze
         Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,
         that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
         In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
         So sprong her grace
         Of heavenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,
         (O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
         And Ermines white.
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
         Bayleaves betweene,
         And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace
         can you well compare?
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.
         Her modest eye,
         Her Majestie,
Where have you seene the like, but there?

I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,
         upon her to gaze:
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,
         it did him amaze.
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
         Let him, if he dare,
         His brightnesse compare
With hers, to have the overthrowe.

Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,
         and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
         O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
         Now she is a stone,
         And makes dayly mone,
Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that ever he begot
         such a Bellibone,
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot
         to beare such an one.
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam,
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,
         And I her shepherds swayne,
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.

I see Calliope speede her to the place,
         where my Goddesse shines:
And after her the other Muses trace,
         with their Violines.
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?
         So sweetely they play,
         And sing all the way,
That it a heaven is to heare.

Lo how finely the graces can it foote
         to the Instrument:
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,
         in their meriment.
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:
         She shalbe a grace,
         To fyll the fourth place,
And reigne with the rest in heaven.

And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,
         raunged in a rowe?
They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight,
         that unto her goe.
Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al,
Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:
         Olives bene for peace,
         When wars doe surcease:
Such for a Princesse bene principall.

Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,
         hye you there apace:
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,
         to adorne her grace.
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:
         Binde your fillets faste,
         And gird in your waste,
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.

Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,
         With Gelliflowres:
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,
         worne of Paramoures.
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies,
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:
         The pretie Pawnce,
         And the Chevisaunce,
Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.

Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,
         in royall aray:
And now ye daintie Damsells may depart
         echeone her way,
I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe:
Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.
         And if you come hether,
         When Damsines I gether,
I will part them all you among.

THENOT
And was thilk same song of Colins owne making?
Ah foolish boy, that is with love yblent:
Great pittie is, he be in such taking,
For naught caren, that bene so lewdly bent.

HOBBINOLL
Sicker I hold him, for a greater fon,
That loves the thing, he cannot purchase.
But let us homeward: for night draweth on,
And twincling starres the daylight hence chase.

Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head,
And let us cast with what delight to chace,
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race.
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.

CUDDY
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.

The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?

PIERS
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:
O what an honor is it, to restraine
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.

CUDDIE
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.

PIERS
Abandon then the base and viler clowne,
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.

Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.

But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.

PIERS
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.

CUDDIE
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

PIERS
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.

CUDDIE
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.

Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

Ever sprung; as sun and showers 
There had made a lasting spring. 
Every thing that heard him play, 
Even the billows of the sea, 
Hung their heads, and then lay by. 
In sweet music is such art, 
Killing care and grief of heart 
Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</span></div></div>

    IN this fyrst glogue Colin clout a shepheardes boy complaineth him of his vnfortunate loue, being but newly (as semeth) enamoured of a countrie lasse called Rosalinde: with which strong affection being very sore traueled, he compareth his carefull case to the sadde season of the yeare, to the frostie ground, to the frosen trees, and to his owne winterbeaten flocke. And lastlye, fynding himselfe robbed of all former pleasaunce and delights, hee breaketh his Pipe in peeces, and casteth him selfe to the ground.


COLIN Cloute.


A Shepeheards boye (no better doe him call)
when Winters wastful spight was almost spent,
All in a sunneshine day, as did befall,
Led forth his flock, that had been long ypent.
So faynt they woxe, and feeble in the folde,
That now vnnethes their feete could them vphold.


All as the Sheepe, such was the shepeheards looke,
For pale and wanne he was, (alas the while,)
May seeme he lovd, or els some care he tooke:
Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile.
Tho to a hill his faynting flocke he ledde,
And thus him playnd, the while his shepe there fedde.


Ye gods of loue, that pitie louers payne,
(if any gods the paine of louers pitie:)
Looke from aboue, where you in ioyes remaine,
And bowe your eares vnto my doleful dittie.
And Pan thou shepheards God, that once didst loue,
Pitie the paines, that thou thy selfe didst proue.


Thou barrein ground, whome winters wrath hath wasted,
Art made a myrrhour, to behold my plight:
Whilome thy fresh spring flowrd, and after hasted
Thy sommer prowde with Daffadillies dight.
And now is come thy wynters stormy state,
Thy mantle mard, wherein thou mas-kedst late.


Such rage as winters, reigneth in my heart,
My life bloud friesing wtih vnkindly cold:
Such stormy stoures do breede my balefull smarte,
As if my yeare were wast, and woxen old.
And yet alas, but now my spring begonne,
And yet alas, yt is already donne.


You naked trees, whose shady leaves are lost,
Wherein the byrds were wont to build their bowre:
And now are clothd with mosse and hoary frost,
Instede of bloosmes, wherwith your buds did flowre:
I see your teares, that from your boughes doe raine,
Whose drops in drery ysicles remaine.


All so my lustfull leafe is drye and sere,
My timely buds with wayling all are wasted:
The blossome, which my braunch of youth did beare,
With breathed sighes is blowne away, &amp; blasted,
And from mine eyes the drizling teares descend,
As on your boughes the ysicles depend.


Thou feeble flocke, whose fleece is rough and rent,
Whose knees are weak through fast and evill fare:
Mayst witnesse well by thy ill gouernement,
Thy maysters mind is ouercome with care.
Thou weak, I wanne: thou leabe, I quite forlorne:
With mourning pyne I, you with pyning mourne.


A thousand sithes I curse that carefull hower,
Wherein I longd the neighbour towne to see:
And eke tenne thousand sithes I blesse the stoure,
Wherein I sawe so fayre a sight, as shee.
Yet all for naught: snch [such] sight hath bred my bane.
Ah God, that loue should breede both ioy and payne.


It is not Hobbinol, wherefore I plaine,
Albee my loue he seeke with dayly suit:
His clownish gifts and curtsies I disdaine,
His kiddes, his cracknelles, and his early fruit.
Ah foolish Hobbinol, thy gyfts bene vayne:
Colin them gives to Rosalind againe.


I loue thilke lasse, (alas why doe I loue?)
And am forlorne, (alas why am I lorne?)
Shee deignes not my good will, but doth reproue,
And of my rurall musick holdeth scorne.
Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake,
And laughes the songes, that Colin Clout doth make.


Wherefore my pype, albee rude Pan thou please,
Yet for thou pleasest not, where most I would:
And thou vnlucky Muse, that wontst to ease
My musing mynd, yet canst not, when thou should:
Both pype and Muse, shall sore the while abye.
So broke his oaten pype, and downe dyd lye.


By that, the welked Phoebus gan availe,
His weary waine, and nowe the frosty Night
Her mantle black through heauen gan overhaile.
Which seene, the pensife boy halfe in despight
Arose, and homeward drove his sonned sheepe,
Whose hanging heads did seeme his carefull case to weepe.</span></div></div>

And all our beauty, and our trim, decays,
Like courts removing, or like ended plays.
The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply;
And all the tackling is a frippery.
No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay
Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday.
Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are,
Have no more wind than the upper vault of air.
We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover,
But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover.

A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray.
He that at sea prays for more wind, as well
Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell.
What are we then? How little more, alas,
Is man now, than before he was? He was
Nothing; for us, we are for nothing fit;
Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion it.

         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest
The violet's reclining head,
         Sat we two, one another's best.
Our hands were firmly cemented
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread
         Our eyes upon one double string;
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet
         Was all the means to make us one,
And pictures in our eyes to get
         Was all our propagation.
As 'twixt two equal armies fate
         Suspends uncertain victory,
Our souls (which to advance their state
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.
And whilst our souls negotiate there,

All day, the same our postures were,

He (though he knew not which soul spake,
         Because both meant, both spake the same)
Might thence a new concoction take
         And part far purer than he came.
This ecstasy doth unperplex,

We see by this it was not sex,
         We see we saw not what did move;
But as all several souls contain
         Mixture of things, they know not what,
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again

A single violet transplant,
         The strength, the colour, and the size,
(All which before was poor and scant)
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.
When love with one another so
         Interinanimates two souls,
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,
         Defects of loneliness controls.
We then, who are this new soul, know
         Of what we are compos'd and made,
For th' atomies of which we grow
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.
But oh alas, so long, so far,
         Our bodies why do we forbear?
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are
         The intelligences, they the spheres.
We owe them thanks, because they thus
         Did us, to us, at first convey,
Yielded their senses' force to us,
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.
On man heaven's influence works not so,
         But that it first imprints the air;
So soul into the soul may flow,
            Though it to body first repair.
As our blood labors to beget
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,
Because such fingers need to knit
         That subtle knot which makes us man,
So must pure lovers' souls descend
         T' affections, and to faculties,
Which sense may reach and apprehend,
         Else a great prince in prison lies.
To'our bodies turn we then, that so
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,
         But yet the body is his book.
And if some lover, such as we,
         Have heard this dialogue of one,
Let him still mark us, he shall see
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.</span></div></div>

If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;

Were her first years the golden age? That's true,

That was her torrid and inflaming time,

Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,

Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
         And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
         To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.</span></div></div>

They sang sometime a song of the field mouse,
That, for because her livelood was but thin,

Would needs go seek her townish sister's house.
She thought herself endured too much pain;
The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse

That when the furrows swimmed with the rain,
She must lie cold and wet in sorry plight;
And worse than that, bare meat there did remain

To comfort her when she her house had dight;
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;
For which she laboured hard both day and night

In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;
And where store was stroyed with the flood,
Then well away! for she undone was clean.

Then was she fain to take instead of food
Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.
"My sister," quod she, "hath a living good,

And hence from me she dwelleth not a mile.
In cold and storm she lieth warm and dry
In bed of down; the dirt doth not defile

Her tender foot, she laboureth not as I.
Richly she feedeth and at the richman's cost,
And for her meat she needs not crave nor cry.

By sea, by land, of the delicates, the most
Her cater seeks, and spareth for no peril.
She feedeth on boiled bacon meet and roast,

And hath thereof neither charge nor travail;
And when she list, the liquor of the grape
Doth glad her heart till that her belly swell."

And at this journey she maketh but a jape;
So forth she goeth, trusting of all this wealth
With her sister her part so for to shape,

That if she might keep herself in health,
To live a lady while her life doth last.
And to the door now is she come by stealth,

And with her foot anon she scrapeth full fast.
Th' other for fear durst not well scarce appear,
Of every noise so was the wretch aghast.

At last she asked softly who was there.
And in her language, as well as she could,
"Peep!" quod the other. "Sister, I am here."

"Peace," quod the towny mouse, "why speakest thou so loud?"
And by the hand she took her fair and well.
"Welcome," quod she, "my sister, by the Rood!"

She feasted her, that joy it was to tell
The fare they had; they drank the wine so clear,
And as to purpose now and then it fell,

She cheered her with "How, sister, what cheer!"
Amids this joy befell a sorry chance,
That, well away! the stranger bought full dear

The fare she had, for, as she look askance,
Under a stool she spied two steaming eyes
In a round head with sharp ears. In France

Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise
Had not i-seen such a beast before,
Yet had nature taught her after her guise

To know her foe and dread him evermore.
The towny mouse fled, she know whither to go;
Th' other had no shift, but wonders sore

Feard of her life. At home she wished her tho,
And to the door, alas! as she did skip,
The Heaven it would, lo! and eke her chance was so,

At the threshold her silly foot did trip;
And ere she might recover it again,
The traitor cat had caught her by the hip,

And made her there against her will remain,
That had forgotten her poor surety and rest
For seeming wealth wherein she thought to reign.

Alas, my Poynz, how men do seek the best
And find the worst, by error as they stray!
And no marvail; when sight is so opprest.

And blind the guide; anon out of the way
Goeth guide and all in seeking quiet life.
O wretched minds, there is no gold that may

Grant that ye seek; no war, no peace, no strife.
No, no, although thy head were hooped with gold,
Sergeant with mace, hawbert, sword, nor knife,

Cannot repulse the care that follow should.
Each kind of life hath with him his disease.
Live in delight even as thy lust would,

And thou shalt find, when lust doth most thee please,
It irketh straight and by itself doth fade.
A small thing it is that may thy mind appease.

None of ye all there is that is so mad
To seek grapes upon brambles or breres;
Nor none, I trow, that hath his wit so bad

To set his hay for conies over rivers,
Ne ye set not a drag-net for an hare;
And yet the thing that most is your desire

Ye do mis-seek with more travail and care.
Make plain thine heart, that it be not knotted
With hope or dread, and see thy will be bare

From all affects, whom vice hath ever spotted.
Thyself content with that is thee assigned,
And use it well that is to thee allotted.

Then seek no more out of thyself to find
The thing that thou hast sought so long before,
For thou shalt feel it sitting in thy mind.

Mad, if ye list to continue your sore,
Let present pass and gape on time to come,
And deep yourself in travail more and more.

Henceforth, my Poynz, this shall be all and some,
These wretched fools shall have nought else of me;
But to the great God and to his high doom,

None other pain pray I for them to be,
But when the rage doth lead them from the right,
That, looking backward, Virtue they may see,

Even as she is, so goodly fair and bright;
And whilst they clasp their lusts in arms across,
Grant them, good Lord, as Thou mayst of Thy might
To fret inward for losing such a loss.</span></div></div>

Let thine own times as an old story be.
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when;
Do not so much as not believe a man.
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth
Is far more business than this world is worth.
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred;
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more,
When this world will grow better than before,
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon
That carcass's last resurrection?
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so,
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago.
To be thus stupid is alacrity;
Men thus lethargic have best memory.
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state
We now lament not, but congratulate.
She, to whom all this world was but a stage,
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age
Should be employ'd, because in all she did
Some figure of the golden times was hid.
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give,
Because she was the form, that made it live;
Nor could complain that this world was unfit
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it;
She, that first tried indifferent desires
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires;
She, to whose person paradise adher'd,
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd
Star-light enough t' have made the South control,
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole;
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this,
What fragmentary rubbish this world is
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought;
He honours it too much that thinks it nought.
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom,
Which brings a taper to the outward room,
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light,
And after brings it nearer to thy sight;
For such approaches doth heaven make in death.
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath,
And think those broken and soft notes to be
Division, and thy happiest harmony.
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack,
And think that but unbinding of a pack,
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence.
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence;
Anger thine ague more, by calling it
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit.
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more,
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before,
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee.
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be,
And think that but for legacies they thrust;
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust;
Give them those sins which they gave thee before,
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score.
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they
Weep but because they go not yet thy way.
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this,
That they confess much in the world amiss,
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that
Which they from God and angels cover not.
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence
They reinvest thee in white innocence.
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low,
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go)
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create
Worms, which insensibly devour their state.
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite
Lays thee to sleep but a Saint Lucy's night.</span></div></div>

Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,
A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;
When I whose sullen care,
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
In prince's court, and expectation vain
Of idle hopes, which still do fly away
Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,
Walked forth to ease my pain
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,
Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,
Was painted all with variable flowers,
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,
Fit to deck maidens' bowers,
And crown their paramours,
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

There, in a meadow, by the river's side,
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,
With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,
As each had been a bride;
And each one had a little wicker basket,
Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,
And with fine fingers cropt full featously
The tender stalks on high.
Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,
The little daisy, that at evening closes,
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,
With store of vermeil roses,
To deck their bridegrooms' posies
Against the bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,
Did never whiter shew,
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.
So purely white they were,
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,
And mar their beauties bright,
That shone as heaven's light,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,
As they came floating on the crystal flood.
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,
Their wondering eyes to fill.
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed,
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array,
So fresh they seemed as day,
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,
And all the waves did strew,
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,
Like a bride's chamber floor.
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,
The which presenting all in trim array,
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,
Whilst one did sing this lay,
Prepared against that day,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content
Of your love's complement:
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile
For ever to assoil.
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,
That fruitful issue may to you afford,
Which may your foes confound,
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'

So ended she; and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong,
Which said their bridal day should not be long.
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground
Their accents did resound.
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,
Making his stream run slow.
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,
Did on those two attend,
And their best service lend,
Against their wedding day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

At length they all to merry London came,
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,
That to me gave this life's first native source;
Though from another place I take my name,
An house of ancient fame.
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride:
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.
But ah, here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,
And Hercules' two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear:
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same:
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,
Which some brave Muse may sing
To ages following,
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

From those high towers this noble lord issuing,
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,
Descended to the river's open viewing,
With a great train ensuing.
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,
Fit for so goodly stature;
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.
They two forth pacing to the river's side,
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;
Which, at th' appointed tide,
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.</span></div></div>

Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

HOBBINOLL
Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,
But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,
Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:
He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.

Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.

THENOT
What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?
And hath he skill to make so excellent,
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?

HOBBINOLL
Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.
Whilome on him was all my care and joye,
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.

But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.

THENOT
But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,
I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:
The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.

HOBBINOLL
Contented I: then will I singe his laye
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.

Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke
         doe bathe your brest,
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
         at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
         Helpe me to blaze
         Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,
         that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
         In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
         So sprong her grace
         Of heavenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,
         (O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
         And Ermines white.
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
         Bayleaves betweene,
         And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace
         can you well compare?
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.
         Her modest eye,
         Her Majestie,
Where have you seene the like, but there?

I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,
         upon her to gaze:
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,
         it did him amaze.
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
         Let him, if he dare,
         His brightnesse compare
With hers, to have the overthrowe.

Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,
         and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
         O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
         Now she is a stone,
         And makes dayly mone,
Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that ever he begot
         such a Bellibone,
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot
         to beare such an one.
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam,
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,
         And I her shepherds swayne,
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.

I see Calliope speede her to the place,
         where my Goddesse shines:
And after her the other Muses trace,
         with their Violines.
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?
         So sweetely they play,
         And sing all the way,
That it a heaven is to heare.

Lo how finely the graces can it foote
         to the Instrument:
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,
         in their meriment.
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:
         She shalbe a grace,
         To fyll the fourth place,
And reigne with the rest in heaven.

And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,
         raunged in a rowe?
They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight,
         that unto her goe.
Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al,
Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:
         Olives bene for peace,
         When wars doe surcease:
Such for a Princesse bene principall.

Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,
         hye you there apace:
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,
         to adorne her grace.
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:
         Binde your fillets faste,
         And gird in your waste,
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.

Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,
         With Gelliflowres:
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,
         worne of Paramoures.
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies,
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:
         The pretie Pawnce,
         And the Chevisaunce,
Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.

Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,
         in royall aray:
And now ye daintie Damsells may depart
         echeone her way,
I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe:
Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.
         And if you come hether,
         When Damsines I gether,
I will part them all you among.

THENOT
And was thilk same song of Colins owne making?
Ah foolish boy, that is with love yblent:
Great pittie is, he be in such taking,
For naught caren, that bene so lewdly bent.

HOBBINOLL
Sicker I hold him, for a greater fon,
That loves the thing, he cannot purchase.
But let us homeward: for night draweth on,
And twincling starres the daylight hence chase.

Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head,
And let us cast with what delight to chace,
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race.
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.

CUDDY
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.

The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?

PIERS
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:
O what an honor is it, to restraine
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.

CUDDIE
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.

PIERS
Abandon then the base and viler clowne,
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.

CUDDYE
Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.

But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.

PIERS
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.

CUDDIE
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

PIERS
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.

CUDDIE
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.

Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

PIERS
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

Love has reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain."

Co-supremes and stars of love,

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.

Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
And the Turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem but cannot be;
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

That are either true or fair;

Remember then this lullaby.</span></div></div>
