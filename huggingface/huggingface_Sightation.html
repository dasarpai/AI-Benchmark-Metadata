image illustrates the life cycle of a dragonfly, displaying three primary stages: Egg, Nymph, and Dragonfly. Beginning with the Egg, this stage serves as the initial phase where the lifecycle commences. The image then transitions to the Nymph stage, depicted as a smaller aquatic form, which is the second stage of development. Following the Nymph, the process culminates in the Dragonfly, the adult form characterized by its vibrant wings and distinct body structure. A circular connection in the design visually represents the progression between these stages: Eggs develop into Nymphs, which subsequently transform into Dragonflies. Additionally, there is an upward arrow indicating the transition from the Nymph to the adult Dragonfly, emphasizing the growth and metamorphosis that takes place during this vital transformation. This life cycle not only highlights the sequential changes but also the interconnectedness of each stage, illustrating the intricate process of dragonfly development.&quot;},&quot;rejected&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The image illustrates the life cycle of a dragonfly, depicted through a clear and concise diagram. At the top left, small oval shapes represent dragonfly eggs, indicating the starting point of the life cycle. An arrow points from the eggs to the next stage labeled \&quot;Nymph,\&quot; found at the top right. This stage is symbolized by a simplified, stylized drawing of a dragonfly nymph, which showcases its elongated body and gill-like structures, suggesting its aquatic habitat. Below, at the center of the diagram, is a prominent illustration of the adult dragonfly in full color, capturing its delicate wings and elongated abdomen, signifying its emergence from the nymph stage. Two large arrows loop from the nymph stage to the dragonfly and back again, indicating the developmental progression from one phase to the next. Additionally, there is a red arrow curving away from the adult dragonfly, suggesting a further conceptual direction of the cycle, perhaps hinting at reproduction or environmental interaction. The overall design is clean and educational, focusing on the transformative journey of dragonflies from egg to nymph to adult, illustrating the cyclical nature of their life cycle.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/Sightation/SightationPreference/--/5316510f71126c8f88e5d29cbba3ff4cdcd95cc7/--/default/train/1/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742922446&amp;Signature=FTPhKYzv0-icmw-KzBGcxYu~T-bGOjEa5R9gm4a0Igy765nrrHaZsSzc~aTsHWcAoV1T5KXvgWEokFhSkjLJtdL8nHNOAHxLbzElceJgWmW63lqU5J5t8HO3YvMcCGNmoA5zf7ZVIdBLnGWTah-K44~2pgu3w0DANLOlQybIYSaMZ3eDVaeL8HQJw-K-UmxPIQTJOin0GvUUGxdygWSqKSSCKH6ZmP3nKhIqP7boasfB1w7-DWIExRATtHSLKPEdCXCGP0w3gw7kIEZqqP~BSiH~5TcEyr7uINckrXbE3oeelQFcZmXXfIm1Mb-FDwfxf~FnG2bFTGHZL33Hvgacsg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:168,&quot;width&quot;:429},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;image_fn&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1001.png&quot;},&quot;chosen&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The image presents three distinct footprints arranged in a row on a blank background, each labeled to signify different arch types of the foot. On the left, the footprint labeled \&quot;Normal (neutral) arch\&quot; displays a balanced curvature along the inner side of the foot, indicating an equable distribution of weight and support. The arch is moderately pronounced, showing a visible connection between the ball of the foot and the heel, creating a well-rounded appearance. In the center, the footprint marked \&quot;High arch\&quot; features a significantly elevated arch that leaves a smaller imprint along the inner side, depicting minimal surface contact with the ground. This shape suggests that the foot's weight is transferred primarily to the toes and heel, often resulting in a more pronounced gap along the arch area. The details of the toes and heel are prominent, with less of the foot's midsection touching the ground. On the right, the footprint labeled \&quot;Flat arch\&quot; exhibits a nearly straight silhouette with very little to no arch, indicating that the entire foot makes contact with the ground. This type of arch suggests a broader surface area with an imprint that appears almost uniform throughout its length, leading to possible implications for weight distribution and support during activities. The contrasting shapes of each footprint collectively illustrate the variation in foot anatomy, highlighting how these differences can influence gait and overall foot health.&quot;},&quot;rejected&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The image features three footprints displayed side by side, each illustrating a different type of foot arch.

The arrows in the diagram indicate the relationships and pathways between these transformations, emphasizing that rocks can change from one type to another in various ways throughout geological time, creating a complex and interconnected system.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/Sightation/SightationPreference/--/5316510f71126c8f88e5d29cbba3ff4cdcd95cc7/--/default/train/72/image/image.jpg?Expires=1742922446&amp;Signature=nAa7SfGA4Ipz6MckntHTbTuqvZT0Bxjy9H5ettI9gJBG6RwghcVBdnJ9sX9NtLIkYDlj9xcdsP02m~4WAojpYJ1lxCoN6Y0LOd~16a5EG-oVQVHyQsH3qqn4QdUx6Js74NxObb9Y5sgWTQDyWRBaXOUS-XF-iUqB5lDwJr3aLhzk~~8Kq2g~ZBxTcWk6O~gXQwKHJGyg6rIpxRZ2p59LOI9B-8qRKUotSAmZmLFcEhPoQvPOFVXXrRHNNctWSghXq67Bg5YJKBK7XUJh6cZsOi8G2WP0Tqf1hvZGnWhl7yXZ~UerCUsLIlxDLrXYlsqyaqodmfMN6ac4RMUJWu-vZg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K3EI6M078Z3AC3&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:580},&quot;inferredFromUrl&quot;:false},&quot;image_fn&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1341.png&quot;},&quot;chosen&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The image illustrates the rock cycle, a geological process that describes how different types of rocks transform into one another over time. At the top left, there's a depiction of an igneous rock, characterized by its rough texture and visible minerals. This type of rock is formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava and is labeled as step 1. From there, the cycle progresses to step 2, where fragments of igneous rock are shown, symbolizing the erosion and weathering processes that break down rock material into smaller particles. Moving clockwise, step 3 represents sedimentary rock, which is often formed from compacted sediments, indicated by smooth pebbles and a lighter, softer appearance. In step 4, metamorphic rock is displayed, illustrating a denser, more crystalline structure that results from the transformation of existing rocks under heat and pressure. Finally, step 5 draws back to the cycle's beginning, where metamorphic rocks can be subjected to extreme conditions, possibly melting back into magma, thus repeating the cycle. The central idea, \&quot;Rock Cycle,\&quot; is presented in a playful green font, emphasizing the continuous nature of this geological process, with arrows linking each step to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the various rock types and the transformations they undergo over geologic time.&quot;},&quot;rejected&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The image illustrates the Rock Cycle, a fundamental concept in geology that depicts the continuous processes by which different types of rocks transform into one another over time. At the center of this illustration are the four main types of rock: Igneous Rock, Sedimentary Rock, Metamorphic Rock, and an additional, unspecified type. The image highlights the transformative journey starting with the formation of Igneous Rock, which often originates from volcanic activity, as suggested by the accompanying illustration of a rock displaying a volcanic nature. Directional arrows are prominently featured throughout the diagram, guiding the viewer through the cyclical processes.

In the top half, the Spring Tide is represented, occurring during the New Moon phase. Here, the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned in a straight line, which is a prime arrangement for Spring Tides, causing the highest high tides. The illustration indicates the Earth moving to the right, emphasizing the gravitational pull exerted by the Moon and Sun combined, leading to this significant tidal effect. The bottom half of the image focuses on the Neap Tide, which occurs during the Moon's Third Quarter phase. In this scenario, the Moon is positioned at a right angle to the Earth and Sun, resulting in lower high tides and higher low tides compared to Spring Tides. Again, the Earth’s movement to the right is noted, illustrating the dynamic nature of tidal forces as the Moon orbits our planet. This dual representation effectively communicates the contrasting tidal effects and their relationship with lunar phases, helping to understand how these celestial arrangements influence ocean tides.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">The image illustrates two distinct tidal phenomena: Spring Tide and Neap Tide, differentiated by the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. In the upper section, titled "Spring Tide," the Sun and the New Moon are aligned with the Earth in an elongated configuration. This alignment magnifies the gravitational pull on Earth's oceans, resulting in higher high tides and lower low tides, often leading to more significant tidal ranges. The visual representation indicates the Sun's rays directed towards the Earth and Moon, emphasizing the dynamic interplay contributing to this tidal event. In contrast, the lower section labeled "Neap Tide" shows a different arrangement: the Moon is positioned at the Third Quarter phase, with the Earth and the Sun forming a right angle with the Moon. In this configuration, the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon partially offset each other, resulting in lower high tides and higher low tides, leading to a smaller tidal range. The annotations in the diagrams help clarify the distinct positions and phases of the Moon during these two tidal events, with arrows demonstrating the gravitational interplay and tidal effects. This visual representation effectively encapsulates how the positions of celestial bodies directly influence tidal patterns on Earth.</span></div></div>

<p>Sightation Counts: Leveraging Sighted User Feedback in Building a BLV-aligned Dataset of Diagram Descriptions
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13369"><img alt="arXiv" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2503.13369-b31b1b.svg"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Often, the needs and visual abilities differ between the annotator group and the end user group.
Generating detailed diagram descriptions for blind and low-vision (BLV) users is one such challenging domain.
Sighted annotators could describe visuals with ease, but existing studies have shown that direct generations by them are costly, bias-prone, and somewhat lacking by BLV standards.
In this study, we ask sighted individuals to assess—rather than produce—diagram descriptions generated by vision-language models (VLM) that have been
guided with latent supervision via a multi-pass inference. The sighted assessments prove effective and useful to professional educators who are themselves BLV and teach visually
impaired learners. We release SIGHTATION, a collection of diagram description datasets spanning 5k diagrams and 137k samples for completion, preference, retrieval, question answering,
and reasoning training purposes and demonstrate their fine-tuning potential in various downstream tasks.</p>

		About SightationPreference
	</span>
</h2>
<p>SightationPreference is a preference dataset consisting of 1k diagrams and 10k chosen-rejected description samples. We constructed the chosen-rejected pairs from three contenders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In-model Contenders</p>
<ul>
<li>The sighted annotators chose a preferred description from 1k pairs of 2 different diagram descriptions: basic description and guide-generated description.
Two descriptions were generated by GPT4o-mini and Qwen2-VL-72B, resulting in 1k*2=2k chosen-rejected pairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cross-model Contenders</p>
<ul>
<li>Within each of the 4 cross-model comparisons (e.g., basic description from GPT VS guide-generated description from Qwen), the winner was chosen using the rated score annotated by the sighted users, resulting in 1k*4=4k chosen-rejected pairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Synthetic Contenders</p>
<ul>
<li>With the 4k descriptions generated by GPT and Qwen, we synthesized an inferior (“rejected”) description by removing its best sentence, which was annotated by the sighted users.
We removed a random non-best sentence from the original description and label to synthesize the “chosen” description, resulting in 4k chosen-rejected pairs.</li>
</ul>
