Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, presents a predominantly clonal structure that has been shaped by recombination events leading to six genetic groups (DTUs, discrete typing units, TcI-TcVI). Several conventional and unconventional genetic exchange events have been described, including hybridization and mitochondrial introgression, which is explored here among Bolivian and Peruvian strains belonging to TcI because recombination events have been previously suspected by means of the MLMT method (multilocus microsatellite typing). We analyzed the variation of one nuclear (Gpi) and one mitochondrial (Nd1) gene among 60 TcI strains and 15 reference strains belonging to the six DTUs. The results clearly showed that one strain isolated from Triatoma infestans in the Cochabamba department (Bolivia) presented a genotype TcI for Gpi and a mitochondrial Nd1 genotype common to the DTUs TcIII, IV, V, and VI; this can be interpreted as a mitochondrial introgression event between distant DTUs.

Universal child care and more generous college-tuition grants would insure against some of the costs of parenting.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;I've read this text.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Organization in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;government\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;Social Security\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;Medicare\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Nationality in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;Americans\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes dish in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Gender in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Policy in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;health reform\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;paid sick leave\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;Universal child care\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;college-tuition grants\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Title in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;Social Democratic America\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Location in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;Vermont\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;United States\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;Scandinavian countries\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Activity in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;parenting\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Person in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;Kenworthy\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;President Obama\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes animal in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ner_9&quot;},&quot;conversations&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Text: The growth in use of credit and debit cards has been met with a rise in fraud and theft.

Providing birds with natural food, supplementary food and water will ensure your garden will be visited all year round by a host of different birds. It is important to feed your garden birds responsibly and safely. By following a few simple guidelines, you can play a valuable role in helping your local birds overcome periods of natural food shortage, survive periods of severe winter weather and come into good breeding condition in the spring. Supplementary feeding can’t provide all the natural proteins and vitamins that adult and young birds need, so it’s important to create and manage your garden to provide a source of natural foods as well, through well-managed lawns, shrub and flowerbeds.

Chaired by Justice Minister Michael Keenan, the Firearms Industry Reference Group (FIRG) made it clear that the new document and entire review process was deeply divisive and a wasted opportunity to address oppressive restrictions affecting more than one million Australian citizens. SSAA National President Geoff Jones flew the flag for our 180,000-plus members, receiving another apology for the handgun fiasco that failed to recognise the SSAA’s many legitimate handgun competitions. But it was the new NFA that the FIRG members took the Minister to task on. Minister Keenan assured the group that there was no intention to change the original document, except to recategorise lever-action shotguns.

Chaired by Justice Minister Michael Keenan, the Firearms Industry Reference Group (FIRG) made it clear that the new document and entire review process was deeply divisive and a wasted opportunity to address oppressive restrictions affecting more than one million Australian citizens. SSAA National President Geoff Jones flew the flag for our 180,000-plus members, receiving another apology for the handgun fiasco that failed to recognise the SSAA’s many legitimate handgun competitions. But it was the new NFA that the FIRG members took the Minister to task on. Minister Keenan assured the group that there was no intention to change the original document, except to recategorise lever-action shotguns. After being pressed on the many apparent unintended changes, the Minister proclaimed that the NFA is not binding on the states or territories. It is an in-principle agreement and if aspects of the NFA are unworkable or unsuitable for a jurisdiction, they have the power to deviate from the document. This was repeated time and time again throughout the meeting and it shines a light on the stark reality of firearms laws in this country: there is no such thing as national firearms laws and the NFA

When you do price comparison, it will be possible to reduce money you will use on a barcode scanner.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;I've read this text.\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes activity in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;research\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;price comparison\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes organization in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;business\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes attribute in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;quality\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;price\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;connectivity\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;operational environment\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;cost\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;applications\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;budget\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes method in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes document in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes cryptocurrency feature in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes city in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes currency in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;money\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes product in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[\\\&quot;barcode scanner\\\&quot;]\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;What describes Person in the text?\&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;gpt\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;[]\&quot;\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;ner_31&quot;},&quot;conversations&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Text: Transition zone defect associated with the response to proton pump inhibitor treatment in patients with globus sensation.

Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, whose WW domain specifically recognizes the pSer/Thr-Pro motif. Pin1 is involved in multiple phosphorylation events that regulate the activities of various substrates, and Pin1 deregulation has been reported in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The WW domain of Pin1 has been used as a small model protein to investigate the folding mechanisms of the β-sheet structure by studying the effect of mutations or its naturally occurring variants. However, only a few studies have investigated the structure and binding of Pin1 WW mutants. In the present work, two naturally occurring Pin1 WW variants, namely, G20D and S16R, derived from the cynomolgus monkey and African green monkey, respectively, were selected to investigate the influence of charge mutation on the structure, stability, and binding properties of the Pin1 WW domain. Analysis using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and chemical shift-based calculations revealed that the G20D and S16R mutants had high structural similarity to the wild-type Pin1 WW domain. However, the presence of a charge mutation significantly decreased the stability of the Pin1 WW domain.&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;I've read this text.&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Antibody in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Protein Domain in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;WW domain\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Protein Motif in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;pSer/Thr-Pro motif\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Disease in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;cancer\&quot;, \&quot;Alzheimer's disease\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Technique in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;nuclear magnetic resonance\&quot;, \&quot;chemical shift-based calculations\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Mutation in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;G20D\&quot;, \&quot;S16R\&quot;, \&quot;charge mutation\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Protein in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;Pin1\&quot;, \&quot;substrates\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Animal in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;cynomolgus monkey\&quot;, \&quot;African green monkey\&quot;]&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;human&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What describes Protein Structure in the text?&quot;},{&quot;from&quot;:&quot;gpt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[\&quot;\\u03b2-sheet structure\&quot;]&quot;}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;from\&quot;: \&quot;human\&quot;,\n    \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;Text: Effects of naturally occurring charged mutations on the structure, stability, and binding of the Pin1 WW domain. Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, whose WW domain specifically recognizes the pSer/Thr-Pro motif. Pin1 is involved in multiple phosphorylation events that regulate the activities of various substrates, and Pin1 deregulation has been reported in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The WW domain of Pin1 has been used as a small model protein to investigate the folding mechanisms of the β-sheet structure by studying the effect of mutations or its naturally occurring variants. However, only a few studies have investigated the structure and binding of Pin1 WW mutants. In the present work, two naturally occurring Pin1 WW variants, namely, G20D and S16R, derived from the cynomolgus monkey and African green monkey, respectively, were selected to investigate the influence of charge mutation on the structure, stability, and binding properties of the Pin1 WW domain. Analysis using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and chemical shift-based calculations revealed that the G20D and S16R mutants had high structural similarity to the wild-type Pin1 WW domain.

after coming face-to-face with an angry Cape buffalo. The unnamed 35-year-old, along with two companions, entered the famous park after dark where they managed to stumble across the fearsome beast. While the other two men managed to escape without injury, their friend was trampled to death. Weighing in excess of 1500 pounds, and standing over a meter in height at the shoulder, the Cape buffalo is well known for its foul disposition. That combination of size and temperament can make them extremely dangerous when startled or threatened, and more than 200 human deaths are attributed to the species each year. That number makes them one of the most dangerous creatures in all of Africa, where they are considered to be amongst the “Big 5” of safari animals.

The unnamed 35-year-old, along with two companions, entered the famous park after dark where they managed to stumble across the fearsome beast. While the other two men managed to escape without injury, their friend was trampled to death. Weighing in excess of 1500 pounds, and standing over a meter in height at the shoulder, the Cape buffalo is well known for its foul disposition. That combination of size and temperament can make them extremely dangerous when startled or threatened, and more than 200 human deaths are attributed to the species each year. That number makes them one of the most dangerous creatures in all of Africa, where they are considered to be amongst the “Big 5” of safari animals.

Also, it behaves in a very unstable way when one uses\\nindividual optimization commands (-fcse-follow-jumps, for example). The\\ncalculation can simply blow up. At the same time, it seems to share some\\ninstability with the g77 compiler. We are using a Sandia DFT code, QUEST,\\nand -O2 and -O3 lead to substantial differences in computed results. I\\nhave found that the optimization call -fcaller-saves is the culprit in\\nQUEST and that its absence leads to no degradation in performance on a\\nstandard non-SCYLD linux box. Also using -O2 -fcaller-saves doesn't lead\\nto really bizarre behavior. It even gives completely correct results,\\neven though it is half as fast as a normal serial Linux box.

Four questions have been addressed in this review. What is morphogenesis? I conclude that morphogenesis is simply development or change of shape and distinguish morphogenesis both from differentiation and from growth, although predominant growth along one axis can alter shape. Morphogenesis can be considered at all levels from the molecule to the population. I concentrated on cells, tissues, and organs. How does the mandible develop? A brief overview of the origin, migration, and differentiation of the neural crest and other cells which constitute the mandible has been provided. How is mandibular morphogenesis controlled? Several lines of evidence are presented to show that basic elements of morphogenesis, eg number and shape of skeletal elements in the mandible, are a property possessed by the mesenchymal cells which will form those tissues, before they differentiate into cartilage or bone. Reaggregated mesenchymal cells form site-specific-shaped cartilages. First arch neural crest, transplanted to sites of presumptive second and third arch neural crest, migrates to the second arch region but forms first branchial arch skeletal and muscle elements in that ectopic site. Morphogenesis is an intrinsic property of the neural crest and of the mesenchymal cells which arise from the crest. What is the developmental basis of craniofacial malformations?

Paula Faris is here with that Good morning, everyone. That video is something, isn't it? The driver was traveling 60 miles an hour when he slammed into a parked tow truck that he claims he didn't see and says his hands were on the wheel at the time of that incident. This morning, an alarming incident involving an Tesla, this time on a packed highway in Russian. A Tesla model 3 electric car became engulfed in flames after it crashed into a parked tow truck on the highway at more than 60 miles per hour. This video which aired on Russian state TV showed the moments after the crash when the Tesla erupts. Reports out of Moscow now say the owner was in drive sass mode, holding the steering wheel and says he did not see that the driver escaped before the flames erupted along with his two children who were rushed to the hospital grateful to be alive.

Paula Faris is here with that Good morning, everyone. That video is something, isn't it? The driver was traveling 60 miles an hour when he slammed into a parked tow truck that he claims he didn't see and says his hands were on the wheel at the time of that incident. This morning, an alarming incident involving an Tesla, this time on a packed highway in Russian. A Tesla model 3 electric car became engulfed in flames after it crashed into a parked tow truck on the highway at more than 60 miles per hour. This video which aired on Russian state TV showed the moments after the crash when the Tesla erupts. Reports out of Moscow now say the owner was in drive sass mode, holding the steering wheel and says he did not see that the driver escaped before the flames erupted along with his two children who were rushed to the hospital grateful to be alive.

Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-16-01562}\n===============\n\nIn the Netherlands, undernutrition rates in community-dwelling older adults range from 10% to 35%, depending on level of care and age \\[[@B1-ijerph-16-01562],[@B2-ijerph-16-01562],[@B3-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. While these rates are lower compared to hospitals and nursing homes, in absolute numbers, the largest number of undernourished older adults live at home \\[[@B4-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. Undernutrition is associated with adverse outcomes such as impaired recovery from diseases, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and mortality \\[[@B5-ijerph-16-01562],[@B6-ijerph-16-01562],[@B7-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. Therefore, early identification of older adults at nutritional risk is necessary to be able to take preventive measures. In the process of identifying persons at risk of undernutrition, screening tools are essential. Over the last decades, many screening tools have been developed and validated \\[[@B8-ijerph-16-01562]\\].

Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-16-01562}\\n===============\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, undernutrition rates in community-dwelling older adults range from 10% to 35%, depending on level of care and age \\\\[[@B1-ijerph-16-01562],[@B2-ijerph-16-01562],[@B3-ijerph-16-01562]\\\\]. While these rates are lower compared to hospitals and nursing homes, in absolute numbers, the largest number of undernourished older adults live at home \\\\[[@B4-ijerph-16-01562]\\\\]. Undernutrition is associated with adverse outcomes such as impaired recovery from diseases, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and mortality \\\\[[@B5-ijerph-16-01562],[@B6-ijerph-16-01562],[@B7-ijerph-16-01562]\\\\]. Therefore, early identification of older adults at nutritional risk is necessary to be able to take preventive measures. In the process of identifying persons at risk of undernutrition, screening tools are essential. Over the last decades, many screening tools have been developed and validated \\\\[[@B8-ijerph-16-01562]\\\\]. Most screening tools for undernutrition in older adults include low body mass index (BMI), loss of (muscle) mass, and/or impaired functioning as criteria \\\\[[@B9-ijerph-16-01562]\\\\].

Professional career\nHaapoja made his professional debut on 8 April 2006, losing a four-round points decision to Remigijus Ziausys, who also debuted. A ten-round split draw against Jari Markkanen on 16 March 2007 denied Haapoja a chance to win the Finnish heavyweight title. He lost for a second time to Denis Bakhtov on 22 May 2008, which was for a WBC and PABA regional heavyweight title. On 28 November 2008, Haapoja stopped Sami Elovaara in nine rounds to become the Finnish heavyweight champion, winning the vacant title in his second attempt. A defence of this title against Jarno Rosberg, which went the ten-round distance, was later relegated to a no contest after Rosberg was caught for steroids. On 23 September 2011, Haapoja won his first major regional title by defeating Faisal Ibnel Arrami via unanimous decision (UD) to become the European Union cruiserweight champion. He made two successful defences against Ian Tims on 21 January 2012 (twelve-round unanimous decision) and Francesco Versaci on 15 September 2012 (fourth-round stoppage), but lost the title to Mateusz Masternak on 15 December 2012 (unanimous decision)."

Local maritime historians say 1,200 of the 2,000 sunken vessels in Lake Michigan no longer exist because they hit shore and broke apart. Experts add that about 360 wrecks have been found in the lake's deeper water, but there are still many wrecks out there that remain undiscovered. A group of explorers recently found a historic steamship off the coast of Muskegon more than a century after it sank. Members of the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association say this is one of the deepest wrecks ever discovered in Lake Michigan. The story begins around midnight on Feb. 9, 1899. Lake Michigan was ice-caked and the 214-foot John V. Moran bucked the ice floes on its run from Milwaukee to Muskegon to deliver a cargo of barreled flour and package goods. The ship was only 11 years old and had an iron-reinforced hull for winter transit, but the conditions on this particular day were too much for the steamer. Ice struck a hole in the hull and water began pouring in. Capt. John McLeod dumped as much of the cargo as he could to lighten the load and try to keep the ship afloat, but it began slipping underneath the ice."

Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, presents a predominantly clonal structure that has been shaped by recombination events leading to six genetic groups (DTUs, discrete typing units, TcI-TcVI). Several conventional and unconventional genetic exchange events have been described, including hybridization and mitochondrial introgression, which is explored here among Bolivian and Peruvian strains belonging to TcI because recombination events have been previously suspected by means of the MLMT method (multilocus microsatellite typing). We analyzed the variation of one nuclear (Gpi) and one mitochondrial (Nd1) gene among 60 TcI strains and 15 reference strains belonging to the six DTUs. The results clearly showed that one strain isolated from Triatoma infestans in the Cochabamba department (Bolivia) presented a genotype TcI for Gpi and a mitochondrial Nd1 genotype common to the DTUs TcIII, IV, V, and VI; this can be interpreted as a mitochondrial introgression event between distant DTUs. These kinds of events, although probably scarce, may have played an important role in the adaptive evolution of the species."

Not a school related question, but it comes up in the Dragon Book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools) in an exercise:\nThe grammar:\nS ::= aSa | aa\ngenerates all even length strings of a's except for the empty string. a) Construct a recursive-descent parser with backtracking for this grammar \nthat tries the alternative aSa before aa. Show that the procedure for S \nsucceeds on 2, 4, or 8 a's, but fails on 6 a's. b) What language does your parser recognize? I'm stumped. It seems like if 4 a's is recognized as S, and two a's between an S is recognized, then 6 a's should be recognized. I tried implementing the parser in C but this one recognizes all even numbers of a's as well. It's not failing to recognize 6 a's. What does this exercise have in mind? /* A C implementation of Exercise 4.13 in the Dragon Book */\n\n/* The grammar:\n\n   S ::= aSa | aa\n\n*/\n\n/* Construct a recursive-descent parser with backtracking for this grammar \n   that tries the alternative aSa before aa."

In his book \"Social Democratic America,\" Kenworthy calls for a raft of new government spending -- family and sick leave, paid for by the state; a pre-kindergarten program subsidized for all families; and more. As Kenworthy explains it, social democracy is really just about setting up governmental insurance to cover Americans in the event of unexpected expenses and losses of income. These programs would guarantee Americans a certain level of economic stability, even if their circumstances change suddenly, and they would help many working-class families handle typical financial headaches. AD\n\nAD\n\nAmericans already have disability and unemployment insurance through the federal government, for example. They hold old-age insurance in the form of Social Security and Medicare to cover the cost of living and health care for people who live longer. President Obama's health reform helps many Americans pay for general medical insurance. Likewise, paid sick leave would insure against loss of income due to short-term illness. Universal child care and more generous college-tuition grants would insure against some of the costs of parenting."

Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) may be related to increasing respiratory mortality and morbidity. We have shown that DEPs augmented the production of inflammatory cytokines by human airway epithelial cells in vitro. To better understand the mechanisms of their proinflammatory activities, we studied the effects of several components extracted from DEPs on interleukin (IL)-8 expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and normal human airway epithelial cells obtained from very peripheral airways by an ultrathin bronchoscope. We used several agents active on signal transduction pathways in cytokine expression, such as the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin, antioxidant agents including N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580. Benzene-extracted components showed effects mimicking DEPs on IL-8 gene expression, release of several cytokines (IL-8; granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation. We also found that NAC, PDTC, and SB203580 suppressed the activities of DEPs and their benzene extracts, suggesting the roles of oxidants-mediated NF-kappa B activation and p38MAPK pathways."

Cummins will be leaving this series and return home to prepare for the Ashes later this year, Cricket Australia confirmed on Friday. “Key fast bowler Pat Cummins will skip the T20 leg of Australia’s Qantas Tour of India in order to rest ahead of the Magellan Ashes this summer,” Cricket Australia said in a statement. Cricket Australia also clarified the 24-year-old is not injured and will look to freshen up ahead of the Sheffield Shield season scheduled from October 26 to March 26 2018. “The paceman is not carrying an injury but selectors have decided to send him home after the fifth ODI in Nagpur on Sunday week in order to freshen up ahead of the start of the Sheffield Shield season,” Cricket Australia said. Australia are slated to play three T20Is from October 7 to 13 in Ranchi, Guwahati and Hyderabad."

It is shown how to use a matrix approach to implement analytic representations of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in univariate and multivariate settings. We provide examples for the univariate case. Krawtchouk polynomials are presented in detail, including a review of Krawtchouk polynomials that illustrates some curious properties of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, as well as presenting an approach to computing Krawtchouk expansions. From a mathematical perspective, we are providing indications as to how to implement in finite terms Rota’s “finite operator calculus\".

Sauf que cela commence à faire maintenant une trentaine d’années que le rap français existe et qu’il a prouvé qu’il était là pour rester . Alors, comment expliquer ce qui ressemble encore et toujours à une absence de prise de risque ? Les racines du mal\n\nLa première raison c’est évidemment le retard objectif que l’on a puisque le rap arrive en France après sa création et sa diffusion dans son pays de naissance les Etats - Unis .

    "value": "Text: Introduction\n============\n\nSpeaking in one's first language (L1) is subjectively effortless, yet speech production involves a complex set of linguistic operations that require cognitive control (Kempen and Hoenkamp, [@B44]; Levelt, [@B53]). Speakers first conceptualize a message and then activate words in memory that are semantically and syntactically compatible with the message. Speakers then select from among this set the specific words that best convey the message, plan their articulation, and finally, implement the speech plan and produce their message at a rate of about 150--300 words per minute (Goldman-Eisler, [@B30]). These processes are incremental in that speakers transfer partially prepared fragments of the message from one stage to the next before completely preparing the message in its entirety. Thus, speakers begin articulating earlier parts of the message before fully activating and planning later parts of the message. The net effect of these cascaded and incremental speech processes is that native language production is quite cognitively demanding, in terms of word finding and word choice, grammatical and phonological realization, and overall fluency (Levelt, [@B53]; Dell et al., [@B23]; Griffin and Ferreira, [@B36])."

From general bird feeds to more specialist varieties, meal worms and suets we have a varied selection. We also stock bird feeders from seeds through to sunflower hearts as well as bird tables and bird baths. Providing birds with natural food, supplementary food and water will ensure your garden will be visited all year round by a host of different birds. It is important to feed your garden birds responsibly and safely. By following a few simple guidelines, you can play a valuable role in helping your local birds overcome periods of natural food shortage, survive periods of severe winter weather and come into good breeding condition in the spring. Supplementary feeding can’t provide all the natural proteins and vitamins that adult and young birds need, so it’s important to create and manage your garden to provide a source of natural foods as well, through well-managed lawns, shrub and flowerbeds. For more information on how to attract birds to your garden, what food to provide them with and other interesting facts you may wish to visit the RSPB website here: RSPB\n\nPlease note that due to the Sunday Trading Laws, we are not open on Easter Sunday."

    "value": "Text: Shifting Memories: Burial Practices and Cultural Interaction in Bronze Age China: A study of the Xiaohe-Gumugou cemeteries in the Tarim Basin\n\n2019 (English)\n\nStudent thesis\n\nThis study focuses on the burial practices in the Bronze Age Xiaohe-Gumugou cemeteries, north-west China, in order to understand how people constructed their social identities and delivered the social cognitions through generations. The Xiaohe-Gumugou cemeteries, as the main sites of the Xiaohe cultural horizon, have central roles for the understanding of the formation of the Bronze Age cultural groups and the cultural interactions between the west and the east in the Tarim Basin. However, current research is lacking in-depth examinations of the material culture of the cemeteries, and the contexts of the surrounding archaeological cultures in a timespan from Bronze Age to Iron Age. Through detailed comparisons of the construction of coffins and monuments, the dress of the dead, and the burial goods assemblages, this study provides an overview of the social structural development, from the Gumugou group’s heterogenous condition to the Xiaohe group’s homogeneous and mature state. Also, through relating to the results of biological and osteological analyses, and applying geographical analyses to the material, this study suggests that the early settlers in the Tarim Basin, the Xiaohe-Gumugou people have created their own social identities."

In recognition of the importance of systems biology to the future of biological and biomedical research, the Trustess of Columbia University approved the creation of the Department of Systems Biology in June 2013. Although the Center of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics still exists, it is now a center within the Department of Systems Biology, bringing together investigators from around the university whose primary interests are in computational biology. Because of the importance of computational disciplines within the context of systems biology, this arrangement is a natural fit, and is promoting dialogue and collaboration with other members of the Department of Systems Biology whose primary interest is not computation, but approach biology from a systems perspective. Why does the Columbia Initiative in Systems Biology have faculty from so many different departments? Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field that can be approached from a variety of perspectives. At Columbia, you can pursue training in computational biology as part of a program that closely matches your interests. Do you accept international students? Is it possible for a graduate student to do both experimental and computational research? Yes. Many of our students use both computational and experimental methods in their research."

    "value": "Text: The recently revised National Firearms Agreement (NFA), quietly released in February, was at the forefront of discussions when the SSAA and other firearms groups converged on the capital last week. Chaired by Justice Minister Michael Keenan, the Firearms Industry Reference Group (FIRG) made it clear that the new document and entire review process was deeply divisive and a wasted opportunity to address oppressive restrictions affecting more than one million Australian citizens. SSAA National President Geoff Jones flew the flag for our 180,000-plus members, receiving another apology for the handgun fiasco that failed to recognise the SSAA’s many legitimate handgun competitions. But it was the new NFA that the FIRG members took the Minister to task on. Minister Keenan assured the group that there was no intention to change the original document, except to recategorise lever-action shotguns. After being pressed on the many apparent unintended changes, the Minister proclaimed that the NFA is not binding on the states or territories. It is an in-principle agreement and if aspects of the NFA are unworkable or unsuitable for a jurisdiction, they have the power to deviate from the document. This was repeated time and time again throughout the meeting and it shines a light on the stark reality of firearms laws in this country: there is no such thing as national firearms laws and the NFA itself carries no weight whatsoever."

Few data describing short-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in patients with globus sensation exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of high-resolution manometry (HRM) for predicting the response to PPI treatment in patients with globus sensation. A total of 41 patients with globus sensation were treated with PPIs for 4 weeks and were classified as positive and negative responders. HRM topographical plots were analyzed for relevant manometric parameters. In addition, clinical and HRM data of 20 patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) not presenting globus symptom were analyzed. Of the 41 patients, 19 (46%) were clinically diagnosed with GERD. The proportion of patients with favorable symptomatic improvement was higher in patients with GERD than in those without reflux (P=0.046). Positive and negative responders to PPI treatment did not differ in upper esophageal sphincter and proximal esophageal contraction. In globus patients with GERD, the temporal and spatial dimension of the transitional zone were greater among negative responders than among PPI-positive responders (P=0.010 and P=0.011). Regarding GERD patients without globus, there was no significant difference in transition zone defect according to PPI responsiveness."

The 456 strains identified included 12 different genera, with a clear predominance (68%) of Penicillium, Aspergillus, Trichoderma and Cladosporium. To assess the risk of poisoning due to the presence of these fungi in shellfish farming areas, the strains were cultured in liquid medium, filtered, and tested on larvae of Artemia salina, a small crustacean highly sensitive to mycotoxins. Thirty-five point five percent of the strains proved active with this test. This study confirms the existence of fungi in shellfish farming areas, as suggested by our earlier work showing that filter-feeding shellfish accumulate toxic metabolites of fungal origin. The presence of fungi in the marine environment represents a real risk of poisoning through the consumption of contaminated shellfish."

Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, whose WW domain specifically recognizes the pSer/Thr-Pro motif. Pin1 is involved in multiple phosphorylation events that regulate the activities of various substrates, and Pin1 deregulation has been reported in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The WW domain of Pin1 has been used as a small model protein to investigate the folding mechanisms of the β-sheet structure by studying the effect of mutations or its naturally occurring variants. However, only a few studies have investigated the structure and binding of Pin1 WW mutants. In the present work, two naturally occurring Pin1 WW variants, namely, G20D and S16R, derived from the cynomolgus monkey and African green monkey, respectively, were selected to investigate the influence of charge mutation on the structure, stability, and binding properties of the Pin1 WW domain. Analysis using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and chemical shift-based calculations revealed that the G20D and S16R mutants had high structural similarity to the wild-type Pin1 WW domain. However, the presence of a charge mutation significantly decreased the stability of the Pin1 WW domain."

(courtesy of That Hashtag Show) reveal that the titular hero will go up against as many as four villains–including three members of the Sivana Family and a baddie whose whole persona is rooted in mystery. The first antagonist Billy Batson/Shazam, played by Chuck and Thor: Ragnarok actor Zachary Levi, will attempt to take down is his arch-nemesis Doctor Thaddeus Bodog Sivana, an \"evil sorcerer who regenerates from death with world domination on his mind.\" Within the DC Comics lore, Doctor Sivana has consistently been portrayed as (unsurprisingly given his title) a doctor of science, so it's interesting to hear that Shazam! will see him cozying up to the magical side of things as he had done in The New 52 Justice League comic series. Mark Strong recently confirmed he's the man behind the nefarious villain, telling ContactMusic, ”I'm playing an evil bastard called Doctor Sivana. They are always the best characters to play, the most fun."

The backlash gathered momentum after a disastrous TV interview, on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, in which the Prime Minister was asked four times whether she was aware of the incident – but refused to confirm or deny. Reports in The Sunday Times claim that the launch of an unarmed Trident II D5 missile from a British submarine off the coast of Florida in June malfunctioned. A source told the paper that the missile could have veered off in the wrong direction after being launched and started heading towards America. Mrs May did not mention this test in a speech to MPs before the Commons vote, in which she urged them to back renewal, leading to allegations the malfunction has been covered up\n\nJeremy Corbyn responded to Ms May’s evasiveness by describing the alleged incident, which took place in July, as a “pretty catastrophic error”. “We understand the Prime Minister chose not to inform Parliament, and instead it came out through the media,\" he told Sky News."

The unnamed 35-year-old, along with two companions, entered the famous park after dark where they managed to stumble across the fearsome beast. While the other two men managed to escape without injury, their friend was trampled to death. Weighing in excess of 1500 pounds, and standing over a meter in height at the shoulder, the Cape buffalo is well known for its foul disposition. That combination of size and temperament can make them extremely dangerous when startled or threatened, and more than 200 human deaths are attributed to the species each year. That number makes them one of the most dangerous creatures in all of Africa, where they are considered to be amongst the “Big 5” of safari animals. What exactly the three men were doing inside the national park after dark is unclear, although officials believe they were there to poach animals of some kind. Poaching has become a major problem for South Africa, where rhinos are being killed at a record pace in order to harvest their horns. Prized for their use in traditional medicines in Asia, those horns are then sold on the black market for as much as $100,000."

However, the heat equation can have a spatially-dependent diffusion coefficient (consider the transfer of heat between two bars of different material adjacent to each other), in which case you need to solve the general diffusion equation. There is no relation between the two equations and dimensionality. Both equations can be solved in one dimension, with a straight-forward substitution $\\nabla\\to\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$, or left in the multiple dimensions as I give above (which would likely require a numerical solver)."

The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) is a new instrument to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the retina. It is based on confocal laser scanning technology. Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage. As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk. A total of 21 patients suffering from optic disk swelling of various etiologies were included in a pilot study. Measurements were taken at six different time points. The maximum optic disk elevation and the volume of swelling were evaluated. Visual acuity and the visual field were determined, and fundus photographs were taken. A reduction in optic disk swelling over time may be demonstrated by both morphological parameters and correlates with improvement in fundus changes. The change in the volume of swelling is greater than the change in maximum disk elevation. The course of optic disk swelling differs between patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and those with pseudotumor cerebri. No correlation was found between our measurements with the HRT and functional parameters (visual acuity and visual field)."

Although the Office of Management and Budget reported that progress has been made in IT security, most of the 24 executive branch agencies covered by the law fell far short of goals set by OMB. The subcommittee in December gave the government an overall grade of D in IT security based on FISMA reports for 2003. Karen Evans, OMB administrator for electronic government and IT, said the same security weaknesses are found year after year, legacy systems continue to operate with serious weaknesses and agencies still are not adequately prioritizing IT spending. She said OMB has halted fiscal 2004 spending on some IT programs until agencies fix security problems in existing systems. 'Dollars are not moving out until we have the plans,' she said, but she could not say how much money was involved or what projects have been delayed. A lack of individual accountability for compliance was cited several times as a cause of slow progress in security reform. Putnam said he is working with Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) to amend the Clinger-Cohen Act 'to explicitly identify information security as a required element of the IT investment management oversight and decision making process.'"

It is not difficult to form stable aqueous dispersions of such resins by addition of the resin feed, an appropriate dispersing agent and catalyst to water with stirring. However, emulsification of resins produced by other polymerization techniques requires that the bulk polymer must be dispersed in water to obtain an aqueous dispersion. Such a type is the hydrocarbon resins produced from steam-cracked petroleum fractions. These hydrocarbon resins, i.e. petroleum resins, are defined herein as the thermoplastic resins obtained by polymerization, in the presence of a catalyst of the Friedel-Crafts type, of steam cracked petroleum distillates, boiling in the range between about 30.degree. C. and 280.degree. C., or any fraction of these distillates boiling within the said range, or of mixtures of olefins and diolefins containing sufficient diolefins to obtain a resin and not an oil. This polymerization is performed at temperatures which range generally from 0.degree. to 70.degree. C., and preferably from 30.degree. C. to 55.degree. C.\nThese resins are polydienic in character and can have a ring and ball softening point between about 38.degree. C. and 180.degree."

Despite well-documented racial disparities in prescribing opioid medications for pain, little is known about whether there are disparities in the monitoring and follow-up treatment of patients who are prescribed opioid medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine whether there are racial differences in the use of recommended opioid monitoring and follow-up treatment practices. Our sample included 1646 white and 253 black patients who filled opioid prescriptions for noncancer pain for ≥ 90 consecutive days at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System pharmacy in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Several opioid monitoring and follow-up treatment practices were extracted from electronic health records for a 12-month follow-up period. Findings indicated that 26.3% of patients had opioid agreements on file, pain was documented in 71.7% of primary care follow-up visits, urine drug tests were administered to 49.3% of patients, and 21.2% and 4.2% of patients were referred to pain and substance abuse specialists, respectively. Racial differences were observed in several of these practices. In adjusted comparisons, pain was documented less frequently for black patients than for white patients. Among those who had at least 1 urine drug test, black patients were subjected to more tests, especially if they were on higher doses of opioids."

For spinning black holes the results only partially agree with the results of previous work, where often additional input was used beyond the near-horizon behaviour. A number of discrepancies remains, for example, pertaining to small black holes and to large spinning black holes, which are related to the presence of the higher-derivative couplings. Arguments are presented to explain some of them. For the black rings, the analysis is intricate due to the presence of Chern-Simons terms and due to the fact that the gauge fields are not globally defined. The contributions from the higher-derivative couplings take a systematic form in line with expectations based on a variety of arguments."

That’s because it is a Japanese market car based on the Supra platform. While that is interesting, the cool part is that this particular car is for sale in the U.S.! The 1986 Toyota Soarer is being offered on this eBay listing. The owner says it has only 90,6000 miles on it and is completely stock with only the addition of a boost gauge. Powering the Soarer is a 1G-GTE Twin Turbo inline 2.0L 6 cylinder mated to a 5 speed manual transmission with a limited slip differential. This Soarer is pretty special with its nifty twin-turbo inline 6 that’s a svelte 2.0L. This differed from its U.S. cousin – the Supra – which had naturally aspirated engines. Curious about the Japanese Supra variants? We were too. Here is a brief history of the Japanese Supra variants from our series on the Supra’s History:\n\nThe Japanese domestic market (JDM) Supra line-up was considerably more complicated, thanks mostly to contemporary Japanese road tax laws. To keep the Supra in a cheaper tax bracket, JDM models offered an assortment of 2.0-liter engines and a 2.2-inch (55mm) narrower body with narrower wheels and tires than export models."

    "value": "Text: Activation of insulin-like growth factor signaling induces apoptotic cell death under prolonged hypoxia by enhancing endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Malignant cells in solid tumors survive under prolonged hypoxia and can be a source of resistance to current cancer therapies. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), one of the downstream molecules of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, is a key regulator of translation, integrating multiple environmental and nutritional cues. The activity of mTOR is known to be suppressed under hypoxic conditions in cancer cells, whereas the contribution of this suppression to cell survival has not yet been clarified. We show that stimulating IGF signaling provoked caspase-dependent apoptosis under low oxygen tension in two cancer cell lines, COLO 320 and AsPC-1. In concurrence with increased levels of BAD phosphorylation, cell death was not accompanied by cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The cells were rescued from apoptosis when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or mTOR activity was inhibited, suggesting that these signals are critical in the observed cell death. IGFs and insulin enhanced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response as monitored by induction of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) proteins and the X box protein-1 splicing under hypoxic conditions, and this response was suppressed by inhibiting PI3K and mTOR activity. IGF-induced cell death under hypoxic conditions was prevented by treatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required."

McGowan, Esq., Salter, McGowan, Sylvia &amp; Leonard, Providence, RI, for Appellants. Richard D. King, Jr., Esq., Smith &amp; Brink, Quincy, MA, for Appellee. DECISION AND ORDER\nSMITH, District Judge. Debtors Raymond M. Huelbig and Shawnn M. Huelbig (\"Debtors\") appeal an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated October 1, 2003, dismissing Debtors' Chapter 13 petition. In re Raymond M. Huelbig, 299 B.R. 721 (Bankr.D.R.I.2003). The issue before the Court is whether the Bankruptcy Court correctly determined that the debt allegedly owed by Debtors to Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\") as of the date of Debtors' Chapter 13 petition was both a \"debt\" and \"liquidated\" within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur N. Votolato answered both of these questions affirmatively and granted Allstate's motion to dismiss. For the following reasons, this Court affirms. I. Background\nThis factual recitation is taken largely from that set forth in the Bankruptcy Court's order."

That, and static calls are useful when used correctly (like anything thats useful), but say I am refactoring a legacy app where static calls are there and I have to deal with them whether I like it or not, and I want to make the static calls mockable like above, and I can't change the static method out because of time constraints for example. My main question:\nSo an object gets created in static method : it isn't needed after the result has been returned, ever. What happens? Is it something I need to worry about efficiency wise?"

I conclude that morphogenesis is simply development or change of shape and distinguish morphogenesis both from differentiation and from growth, although predominant growth along one axis can alter shape. Morphogenesis can be considered at all levels from the molecule to the population. I concentrated on cells, tissues, and organs. How does the mandible develop? A brief overview of the origin, migration, and differentiation of the neural crest and other cells which constitute the mandible has been provided. How is mandibular morphogenesis controlled? Several lines of evidence are presented to show that basic elements of morphogenesis, eg number and shape of skeletal elements in the mandible, are a property possessed by the mesenchymal cells which will form those tissues, before they differentiate into cartilage or bone. Reaggregated mesenchymal cells form site-specific-shaped cartilages. First arch neural crest, transplanted to sites of presumptive second and third arch neural crest, migrates to the second arch region but forms first branchial arch skeletal and muscle elements in that ectopic site. Morphogenesis is an intrinsic property of the neural crest and of the mesenchymal cells which arise from the crest. What is the developmental basis of craniofacial malformations? Evidence is presented to show that defects at any stage of mandibular development can lead to craniofacial malformations."

LOS ANGELES- For one little girl, Adrian Young turned out to be more than a crossing guard. Young became her guardian angel. The crossing guard had just finished her shift at Alexandria Avenue Elementary School in Los Angeles when she heard the girl screaming. “She was like ‘Please don’t let her take me. I don’t know her. She’s not my mom,'” Young told CNN affiliate KABC. “I just told her to grab onto me as tight as she could, and I held onto her and the lady just began to attack me, so I just thought about attacking her to make sure she can’t take this little girl,” Young said. “I kind of went into mother mode … because I couldn’t see myself letting this little girl be taken. I’m just grateful I was there.”\n\nAt a public event last week, Los Angeles City Council Member Mitch O’Farrell honored Young for her heroism. “Sometimes superheroes come in small packages,” O’Farrell said, referring to Young’s height."

We present the results of two surveys of measles outbreaks near Vellore, which perhaps supports the cause for introduction of a second dose of measles vaccine. Survey one had 590 under 10-year olds. The attack rate was 15.1, 11.7 and 5.7% in the unimmunized, among those vaccinated at 6 months and at 9 months, respectively. The overall vaccine efficacy (VE) was 28% if vaccinated at 6 months and 66% if at 9 months. Second survey had 1702 children and adolescents. There were 59 cases of measles of which 49 were over 5 years of age, the mean age being 8.8 years. The VE was 66% for children up to 6 years and 48.4% for those aged 7-15. The data suggests that measles vaccine is better given at 9 months. The low VE in school age children could be improved by introducing a second dose of measles vaccine."

    "value": "Text: HIV cases are seeing the largest surge among gay students in China, according to a report from southeastern China. The report released this month from health authorities in Nanchang, the capital of China’s Jiangxi province, showed that HIV infection rate among students at the city’s universities increased by 43% annually in the past five years. Over 80% of cases involved men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). And Nanchang is not the only city that is facing such a trend – more than 100 new cases among students are being reported annually in Beijing; while Shanghai reported 92 students infected with HIV in 2015. Data from China’s Health and Family Planning Commission show that the growth rate of student infections has surpassed that of other groups, with 81.6% of the cases concerning young MSMs who are still schooling. The country’s health authorities are worried about this trend, especially in a country that declassified homosexuality as a mental illness only in 2001. There is also almost no public discussion of gay issues or rights, in any form. Activists, though, attribute this trend to the health authorities’ improper handling of the issue."

Paula Faris is here with that Good morning, everyone. That video is something, isn't it? The driver was traveling 60 miles an hour when he slammed into a parked tow truck that he claims he didn't see and says his hands were on the wheel at the time of that incident. This morning, an alarming incident involving an Tesla, this time on a packed highway in Russian. A Tesla model 3 electric car became engulfed in flames after it crashed into a parked tow truck on the highway at more than 60 miles per hour. This video which aired on Russian state TV showed the moments after the crash when the Tesla erupts. Reports out of Moscow now say the owner was in drive sass mode, holding the steering wheel and says he did not see that the driver escaped before the flames erupted along with his two children who were rushed to the hospital grateful to be alive. Tesla features an auto pilot mode which is not a self-driving system."

I see the tutorial said that If wanna use Response Caching, I must call new OkHttpClient() exactly once (a singleton instance). OkhttpClient is thread-safe by synchronized methods. But in my application, there are many threads connects to the network to get remote data simultaneously, some threads must wait for a thread have done getting data to execute its operation. So Is it's performance not better than normal? If yes, If I don't enable Reponse Caching, should I call new OkHttpClient() many times for better performance? Thanks\n\nA:\n\nFor the best performance, share a single OkHttpClient instance. This allows your cache to be shared, and in the future when we implement fancy joining &amp; cancelling it’ll allow outgoing requests to be merged."

Since pregnancy is an acquired hypercoagulable state, women harboring thrombophilia may present with clinical symptoms of vascular complications for the first time during gestation or at the postpartum period(1). Women with thrombophilia may have an increased risk of placental vascular complications, including pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction,and placental abruption. Accumulating data suggest that maternal antithrombotic prophylaxis may result in improved gestational outcome. Randomized trials are under way and hopefully will optimize maternal and neonatal outcome."

When making a Gradient Ramp in After Effects is there a convenient way for it to be tied to the object its applied to. I'm sure with Expressions I could somehow Pickwhip it together and adjust the code, but is there any check box or something more efficient? It's a bit tedious when I make a Gradient Ramp and then have to move the object the Gradient Ramp gets left behind. Thinking there must be a better way. Here's a screencap to try and illustrate. I decided to switch the order so it will be Blue on top then Red. I changed the position of the bottom two bars but the Gradient got left behind. That's why they look flat. A:\n\nFor a situation like this, your best approach is to pre-compose individual timelines consisting of just the bar, one for each color of bar in the final composition. You can use a ramp or a fill effect in the pre-comps, since you're rendering the effect only once. Pre-comps are the equivalent of symbols in Ai, Fl or Edge Animate, or of Smart Objects in Photoshop.-- You can place multiple instances, and any change to the original updates all of them at once."

Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-16-01562}\n===============\n\nIn the Netherlands, undernutrition rates in community-dwelling older adults range from 10% to 35%, depending on level of care and age \\[[@B1-ijerph-16-01562],[@B2-ijerph-16-01562],[@B3-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. While these rates are lower compared to hospitals and nursing homes, in absolute numbers, the largest number of undernourished older adults live at home \\[[@B4-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. Undernutrition is associated with adverse outcomes such as impaired recovery from diseases, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and mortality \\[[@B5-ijerph-16-01562],[@B6-ijerph-16-01562],[@B7-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. Therefore, early identification of older adults at nutritional risk is necessary to be able to take preventive measures. In the process of identifying persons at risk of undernutrition, screening tools are essential. Over the last decades, many screening tools have been developed and validated \\[[@B8-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. Most screening tools for undernutrition in older adults include low body mass index (BMI), loss of (muscle) mass, and/or impaired functioning as criteria \\[[@B9-ijerph-16-01562]\\]. However, these phenotypic, late symptoms of undernutrition indicate that a person is already at high risk or even undernourished \\[[@B10-ijerph-16-01562]\\]."

But the 20-year-old beauty queen used her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she doesn't 'look Japanese' on the outside, on the inside, there are 'many Japanese things about her'. Ariana Miyamoto was born and raised in Nagasaki, speaks fluent Japanese, and has been selected to represent Japan in the Miss Universe pageant\n\nBut she has been forced to defend herself against accusations that she 'isn't Japanese enough' because her father is African-American\n\nShe has faced a storm of criticism that she is 'not Japanese enough' to represent the country because although her mother is Japanese, her father is American. In Japan, Miyamoto is called a 'hafu', a Japanese term used to refer to someone who is biracial. There is a feeling in the country, one of the least ethnically diverse in the world, that mixed-race people are not fully Japanese. Website Byokan Sunday and Naver Matome report that Twitter users have posted comments such as: 'Is it okay to select a hafu to represent Japan?'"

The Darwinian notion is pushed on a more physical level in television series as The X-men and Mutant X. It is somehow suggested that reality itself has evolved. That the laws of ordinary physics somehow no longer apply. This is possible because the postmodern mind rejects objective reality. Rather, they reason from the premise that each human being lives in his own subjectively created reality: to each his own 'narrative', everyone his own Master of the Universe, the New Reality of \"the smart set\"."
