Let me play with is, send it to me\&quot;. And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called \&quot;I Wish You Would\&quot;, because Jack wrote back and said \&quot;I love that\&quot;. So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:  Okay so this is an idea called \&quot;I Wish You Would\&quot;. It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic.

This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds." And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:  Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this  It's 2 am, in your car Windows down, past my street the memories start It's in the past You drive straight ahead You thinking that I hate you now Cause you stll don't know what I never said  I wish you would come back Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I wish you knew that  Do you like it!?</span></div></div>

They left me on top of my sheets I dreamt I went potty then woke up drenched in me  This day sucked the hardest ever I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today A little bit less than nothing would go my way I got up to toss my soiled sheets  The hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe It was then that I sensed the irony (Burning me) Then I heard the voice say "Come sail aboard S.S. Nepenthe"  I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee In actuality, I let the zetas probe me  Yesterday was all my fault I let negativity get the better of me Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds They temporarily set free this quandary</span></div></div>
