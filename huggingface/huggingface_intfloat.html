The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title \&quot;Cardinal Rector\&quot;, being the last remaining cleric in the Church of England to use the title Cardinal.St Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.St Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature.  In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, \&quot;the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom\&quot;. The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, \&quot;the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold\&quot;. He added in a footnote that \&quot;the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors\&quot;. One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its \&quot;splendour\&quot;; later he appreciated its \&quot;utility\&quot; when he came there as a sinner.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q1640233\tThe Monumentum Ancyranum (Latin 'Monument of Ancyra') or Temple of Augustus and Rome in Ancyra is an Augusteum in Ankara (ancient Ancyra), Turkey.

From a musical family, he is the eldest of three brothers, the other two being proficient bass (Danny) and brass (Ricky) players.He joined 'Big Boy Tomato' which enjoyed a fair amount of success in North and West London, and their 'New Wave of New Wave' sound saw them supporting bands like UK Subs and Stiff Little Fingers. The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including 'Acton Baby' and the four track CD 'Hormones and Hangovers.'  The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged.  Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely Asterix and Animaniacs.  One album, \&quot;Mad Cows and Englishmen\&quot; was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls.  Seeming going nowhere, the band split, though two of the 'Snatches went on to form 'The Yo-Yos', a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts.  Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.All this while, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and toured Japan with the band.  Realizing that he wasn't going to get the gigs he needed if he stayed in London, he moved to America where his working partnership with Watts led to his inclusion in the lineup of KMFDM. He occasionally performs with punk band Dwarves under the alias Dutch Ovens.In late 2007, Selway played the drums for the Seattle rock band, DragStrip Riot and Japanese Pop Star Ayumi Hamasaki in her songs Talkin' 2 Myself and Decision.In 2008, he went on tour with Genitorturers. In 2009 he toured with his (and KMFDM bandmate Jules Hodgson's) new band, The Spittin' Cobras.Andy resides in West Palm Beach with his wife, Christee Carter, and son.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q51899\tCarapelle (Foggiano: Crapell) is a town and comune belonging to the Province of Foggia and situated in the Apulia region of southern Italy.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q8016489\tWilliam P.

Old Main is one of the oldest surviving educational structures in the western United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.Designed by Phoenix architect James Miller Creighton, construction of Old Main began on October 27, 1887. The budget of $37,969 ran out before the roof was finished. When university officials discovered federal loans were available for agricultural schools, they renamed the building from the originally planned School of Mines to the School of Agriculture. Federal funding allowed completion of the building and it opened for the first class of the university on October 1, 1891. Old Main, then the only building on the campus, contained the classrooms, library, offices, and dorms. Six faculty taught 32 students in 1891.In 1919, the Alexander Berger Memorial Fountain was constructed in front of Old Main. Berger funded the project as a memorial for 13 University of Arizona students who were killed in World War I, including his nephew.  Completed for $5500, the fountain was dedicated on January 31, 1920 by General John J. \&quot;Blackjack\&quot; Pershing.Due to neglect by the University, Old Main fell into disrepair and was condemned by the City of Tucson in 1938. Demolition was averted when the US Navy repaired the building in 1942, for use as a Naval Indoctrination Training School during World War II. The Navy then paid $20,000 in 1945 to turn it back into a functioning campus building.The first floor of Old Main was restored and renovated in 2008 at a cost of $4.6 million. It then housed the University's Office of Admissions, Center for Exploratory Students, and the Dean of Student's Office. In January 2013, renovation of the entire building began — including a modernization of the interior spaces, replacing the roof, and framing the porch. It reopened before the 2014-15 academic year. In addition to extensive improvements, the Office of the President was relocated to Old Main.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Q5495280\tFred Goodwins (26 February 1891 – April 1923) was an English actor, film director and screenwriter of the silent era.

He was regarded by his contemporaries as a master of lyricism.  His first compositions were markedly influenced by the works of composers such as Alexander Scriabin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and his compatriot Mykola Lysenko.Kosenko's life is conclusively divided into three distinct phases, in Warsaw, where he studied with renowned teachers Mikhail Sokolovsky and Iryna Miklashovskaya, in Zhytomyr, where he began teaching piano and music theory at the Music Technicum, later becoming director of the Zhytomyr Music School, and finally in Kiev, where he devoted more time to symphonic compositions such as his Heroic Overture, which brought him due recognition in the world of Soviet music. A true artist in the very sense of the word, he was a leading figure among the broad-minded artistic collective of the 20th-century Soviet music.Kosenko's legacy is filled with romantic feeling and intonations of Slavic folk songs and Western-European influences. His vocal, chamber and symphonic works are among the most important pieces of that time in USSR. He composed over 100 compositions for piano among waltzes, preludes, nocturnes, sonatas and mazurkas, in a total of about 250 musical works such as his symphonic Moldavian poem, violin and piano concertos, trios and string quartets during his short musical career.

The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title "Cardinal Rector", being the last remaining cleric in the Church of England to use the title Cardinal.St Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.St Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature.  In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, "the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, "the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold". He added in a footnote that "the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its "splendour"; later he appreciated its "utility" when he came there as a sinner.</span></div></div>

From a musical family, he is the eldest of three brothers, the other two being proficient bass (Danny) and brass (Ricky) players.He joined 'Big Boy Tomato' which enjoyed a fair amount of success in North and West London, and their 'New Wave of New Wave' sound saw them supporting bands like UK Subs and Stiff Little Fingers. The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including 'Acton Baby' and the four track CD 'Hormones and Hangovers.'  The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged.  Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely Asterix and Animaniacs.  One album, "Mad Cows and Englishmen" was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls.  Seeming going nowhere, the band split, though two of the 'Snatches went on to form 'The Yo-Yos', a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts.  Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.All this while, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and toured Japan with the band.  Realizing that he wasn't going to get the gigs he needed if he stayed in London, he moved to America where his working partnership with Watts led to his inclusion in the lineup of KMFDM. He occasionally performs with punk band Dwarves under the alias Dutch Ovens.In late 2007, Selway played the drums for the Seattle rock band, DragStrip Riot and Japanese Pop Star Ayumi Hamasaki in her songs Talkin' 2 Myself and Decision.In 2008, he went on tour with Genitorturers. In 2009 he toured with his (and KMFDM bandmate Jules Hodgson's) new band, The Spittin' Cobras.Andy resides in West Palm Beach with his wife, Christee Carter, and son.</span></div></div>

Old Main is one of the oldest surviving educational structures in the western United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.Designed by Phoenix architect James Miller Creighton, construction of Old Main began on October 27, 1887. The budget of $37,969 ran out before the roof was finished. When university officials discovered federal loans were available for agricultural schools, they renamed the building from the originally planned School of Mines to the School of Agriculture. Federal funding allowed completion of the building and it opened for the first class of the university on October 1, 1891. Old Main, then the only building on the campus, contained the classrooms, library, offices, and dorms. Six faculty taught 32 students in 1891.In 1919, the Alexander Berger Memorial Fountain was constructed in front of Old Main. Berger funded the project as a memorial for 13 University of Arizona students who were killed in World War I, including his nephew.  Completed for $5500, the fountain was dedicated on January 31, 1920 by General John J. "Blackjack" Pershing.Due to neglect by the University, Old Main fell into disrepair and was condemned by the City of Tucson in 1938. Demolition was averted when the US Navy repaired the building in 1942, for use as a Naval Indoctrination Training School during World War II. The Navy then paid $20,000 in 1945 to turn it back into a functioning campus building.The first floor of Old Main was restored and renovated in 2008 at a cost of $4.6 million. It then housed the University's Office of Admissions, Center for Exploratory Students, and the Dean of Student's Office. In January 2013, renovation of the entire building began — including a modernization of the interior spaces, replacing the roof, and framing the porch. It reopened before the 2014-15 academic year. In addition to extensive improvements, the Office of the President was relocated to Old Main.</span></div></div>

In its upper course the stream flows swiftly in a northeastward course and passes rock outcrops, including the Jeffers Petroglyphs.  It flows generally east-northeastwardly through Brown County into northwestern Blue Earth County, where it joins the Minnesota River in Cambria Township, approximately seven miles (11 km) southeast of New Ulm.  For much of its lower course, it roughly parallels the Cottonwood River to the north at a distance of three to ten miles (5–15 km).  The stream's watershed is narrow, with no major tributaries.  Land within the watershed consists primarily of till plains; in 1990, 90% of the land was cultivated for agriculture.Common fish in the river include black and yellow bullhead, rock bass, golden redhorse, and various species of darters and shiners.</span></div></div>

He was regarded by his contemporaries as a master of lyricism.  His first compositions were markedly influenced by the works of composers such as Alexander Scriabin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and his compatriot Mykola Lysenko.Kosenko's life is conclusively divided into three distinct phases, in Warsaw, where he studied with renowned teachers Mikhail Sokolovsky and Iryna Miklashovskaya, in Zhytomyr, where he began teaching piano and music theory at the Music Technicum, later becoming director of the Zhytomyr Music School, and finally in Kiev, where he devoted more time to symphonic compositions such as his Heroic Overture, which brought him due recognition in the world of Soviet music. A true artist in the very sense of the word, he was a leading figure among the broad-minded artistic collective of the 20th-century Soviet music.Kosenko's legacy is filled with romantic feeling and intonations of Slavic folk songs and Western-European influences. His vocal, chamber and symphonic works are among the most important pieces of that time in USSR. He composed over 100 compositions for piano among waltzes, preludes, nocturnes, sonatas and mazurkas, in a total of about 250 musical works such as his symphonic Moldavian poem, violin and piano concertos, trios and string quartets during his short musical career. His vocal compositions include a large number of ballads, choral and folk arrangements as well.</span></div></div>

The design was drawn up by the Italian engineer Battista Antonelli; originally under the control of Spain, the fortress was captured by the British in 1762, and was returned to the Spanish under treaty terms a year later.The Morro fortress in Havana shares its name with structures in Santiago de Cuba and the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In this case,  the Spanish "morro" means a rock which is very visible from the sea and therefore serves as a navigational landmark. Perched on the promontory on the opposite side of the harbor from Old Havana, it can be viewed from miles around as it dominates the port entrance. Built initially in 1589 in response to raids on Havana harbor, el Morro protected the mouth of the harbor with a chain being strung out across the water to the fort at La Punta.</span></div></div>

The line was opened in Willunga by the Governor of South Australia Sir Henry Galway on 20 January 1915, and initially had 16 stopping places between Adelaide and Willunga. It closed beyond Hallett Cove in 1969 and was dismantled in 1972. The Seaford railway line continues from Hallett Cove along a different alignment before rejoining the route of the old line between Seaford Road and Griffiths Drive.The original corridor remains as the 34-kilometre (21 mi) long Coast to Vines Rail Trail. There is some evidence of railway track remaining on this trail, notably near the South Road crossing at Hackham, the top of the Seaford Hill and a small section of track in a paddock adjacent to Victor Harbor Road, McLaren Vale. Occasionally, rails surface through the bitumen at Field Street, McLaren Vale. At Morphett Vale, there is a partially buried platform. There is also some concrete foundations on the platform. These structures are thought to be remains from the Morphett Vale railway station.At the time of its opening, there was a proposal to extend it to Second Valley to connect with coastal steam shipping to Kangaroo Island for holidays, with the route already approved as far as Normanville and Yankalilla. This extension was never built.</span></div></div>

Marie Brizard, a Bordeaux-based distiller, has a product with a similar flavor profile. Another form, produced by DeKuyper, uses a spirit as its base, and is flavoured with lemon, coriander and violets.Guardian writer John Wright describes it as "a potent compound...
