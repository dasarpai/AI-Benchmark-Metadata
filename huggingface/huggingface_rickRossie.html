We re in need, but we re not desperate. Adam can vouch for me, she s more trouble than she s worth. John, you re not looking at the big picture she s got years of experience under her belt she s a great asset Until she double crosses you, Snake hissed, his single eye narrowed at the major. They glared at each other in a lockdown until finally, Zero straightened out the front of his shirt. It doesn t matter. What s done is done and the decision stands, the man finally declared before leaving Snake s office.A low growl rumbled in the man s throat as he gripped the edge of his desk to keep himself from breaking something he would later regret mangling. He didn t need this he was running a goddamn organization neck deep in intelligence with a small amount of people to make sense of things yes, they needed more people on their force. Yes, they needed an experienced spy and negotiator. No, they did not need Eva.Snake couldn t understand what Zero saw in her what made him ignore both Snake s and Adam s vehement objections and welcome her with open arms. Maybe Eva had managed to charm him like she had done to John years ago. He wouldn t be surprised. Either way, something was up and he didn t like it. Adam held a similar animosity for her as John did it was comforting to know that it wasn t just himself being stubborn about the topic, but it still wasn t enough. John wouldn t be satisfied until Eva was gone for good and Zero gave him a full apology for going behind his back like that and letting her in.He needed a walk. He usually was a stoic, poker faced man who was capable of masking and even eliminating his emotions. However, every man s patience had a limit and John s was being tested.Abruptly, he rose from his seat and made his way out of the office, weaved his way through the corridors of the building, before exiting out one of the side doors. As usual, it was a somewhat busy scene outside supplies were being unloaded from delivery trucks and scientists were either conducting their studies or hurrying from one branch to the next, working frantically on whatever the hell they were assigned to.A soft sigh passed through the man s lips before he withdrew a cigar, cut off the end, before sticking it into his mouth. He fished for a lighter in his chest pocket and once finding such, he lit up and sucked in a breath of the godly smoke. His head tilted up as he exhaled through his nose. John hoped dearly that Zero would recognize the error of his ways and would release Eva of her duty but he doubted his prayers would be answered. That man was too damned stubborn and once his mind was made up, there was no chance of changing it.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;Unnamed: 0&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:4,&quot;string&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;thread_title&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;The Bond Between Two Elements&quot;},&quot;thread_href&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://bluemoonroleplaying.com/community/threads/15010/&quot;},&quot;message_timestamp&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Jan 9, 2009 at 12:33 PM&quot;},&quot;message_username&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Malicious Lullaby&quot;},&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Carlyle had been living in the fire nation for a while now.

We re in need, but we re not desperate. Adam can vouch for me, she s more trouble than she s worth. John, you re not looking at the big picture she s got years of experience under her belt she s a great asset Until she double crosses you, Snake hissed, his single eye narrowed at the major. They glared at each other in a lockdown until finally, Zero straightened out the front of his shirt. It doesn t matter. What s done is done and the decision stands, the man finally declared before leaving Snake s office.A low growl rumbled in the man s throat as he gripped the edge of his desk to keep himself from breaking something he would later regret mangling. He didn t need this he was running a goddamn organization neck deep in intelligence with a small amount of people to make sense of things yes, they needed more people on their force. Yes, they needed an experienced spy and negotiator. No, they did not need Eva.Snake couldn t understand what Zero saw in her what made him ignore both Snake s and Adam s vehement objections and welcome her with open arms. Maybe Eva had managed to charm him like she had done to John years ago. He wouldn t be surprised. Either way, something was up and he didn t like it. Adam held a similar animosity for her as John did it was comforting to know that it wasn t just himself being stubborn about the topic, but it still wasn t enough. John wouldn t be satisfied until Eva was gone for good and Zero gave him a full apology for going behind his back like that and letting her in.He needed a walk. He usually was a stoic, poker faced man who was capable of masking and even eliminating his emotions. However, every man s patience had a limit and John s was being tested.Abruptly, he rose from his seat and made his way out of the office, weaved his way through the corridors of the building, before exiting out one of the side doors. As usual, it was a somewhat busy scene outside supplies were being unloaded from delivery trucks and scientists were either conducting their studies or hurrying from one branch to the next, working frantically on whatever the hell they were assigned to.A soft sigh passed through the man s lips before he withdrew a cigar, cut off the end, before sticking it into his mouth. He fished for a lighter in his chest pocket and once finding such, he lit up and sucked in a breath of the godly smoke. His head tilted up as he exhaled through his nose. John hoped dearly that Zero would recognize the error of his ways and would release Eva of her duty but he doubted his prayers would be answered. That man was too damned stubborn and once his mind was made up, there was no chance of changing it.</span></div></div>

She was also his teacher when it came to water bending.She was a young dark skinned but fair skinned sixteen year old girl, having beautiful blue eyes. She wore a necklace that her mother gave her just before she died and she held her brother and father's posessions close to her heart. They were all she had left of them and she wanted to preserve their memory for as long as she lived.Right now she was bathing in the lake, nude of course and sitting on a water covered rock that hid her lower body and her back was turned to the exit of the lake. She had a pot in her hands taht she filled up with water every so often when necessary to pour over her head and body to clean herself. Her short wet, white and blonde hair flattened out as she wettened it, and as the water trickled down her fit and slim body more, it made her look far more exotic than she really was.</span></div></div>
