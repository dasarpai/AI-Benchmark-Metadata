Given an unsorted array of N integers, write a function to sort the given array using insertion sort. 10 4 2 5.&quot;},&quot;assistant&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Sure, here's an implementation of an Insertion Sort algorithm in Python to sort the given array: \n\n```\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\narr = [10, 4, 2, 5]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\n\nThe function `insertion_sort` takes an array `arr` as input, and sorts the array in-place using the insertion sort algorithm. \n\nThe main idea behind the algorithm is to iterate through the array, and for each element at index `i`, we compare it with all the previous elements `j` (starting from `i-1` and going backwards), and move each previous element that is greater than `arr[i]` up one position in the array. Once we find the correct position for the current element (i.e., when a previous element is less than or equal to `arr[i]`), we insert the current element into that position.\n\nIn the implementation above, we use two nested loops to achieve this. The outer loop iterates through the array starting from index `1` (since the element at index `0` is already considered sorted). The inner loop compares the element at index `i` with all the previous elements (starting from `i-1` and going backwards), and moves each previous element that is greater than `arr[i]` up one position in the array. Once we find the correct position for the current element (`key`), we insert it into the array by setting `arr[j + 1] = key`.\n\nFinally, we return the sorted array. \n\nIn the example you provided, the output of the above code would be `[2, 4, 5, 10]`, which is the sorted version of the original array `[10, 4, 2, 5]`.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:7,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, you are given a list of people and their ages.

To determine how many more candles Person A can blow on their next birthday, we need to know the current date.\n\nAssuming today's date is before July 27th, we can calculate the age Person A will turn on their next birthday by adding 1 to their current age. Therefore, Person A will be 21 years old on their next birthday.\n\nTo determine the number of candles Person A can blow on their next birthday, we need to know how old they will be on that day. Since we've determined that Person A will be 21 on their next birthday, they would be able to blow out 21 candles. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of candles Person A can blow on their next birthday is 21.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;For this task, you will be given two sentences A and B.

The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

The winning candidate, John Smith, has promised to focus on improving healthcare and education in his upcoming term. However, the Police Association has raised concerns about budget cuts that could affect public safety.\&quot;\n\nTo find the most similar sentence for each target word using Jaccard Similarity, we'll need to first calculate the sets of words for each sentence in the article, and then compare them to the set of words for each target word. We'll then choose the sentence with the highest Jaccard Similarity score for each target word.\n\nLet's start with the target word \&quot;election\&quot;. We can create a set of words for each sentence in the article as follows:\n\n- Sentence 1: {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}\n- Sentence 2: {'The', 'winning', 'candidate,', 'John', 'Smith,', 'has', 'promised', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'improving', 'healthcare', 'and', 'education', 'in', 'his', 'upcoming', 'term.'}\n- Sentence 3: {'However,', 'the', 'Police', 'Association', 'has', 'raised', 'concerns', 'about', 'budget', 'cuts', 'that', 'could', 'affect', 'public', 'safety.'}\n\nNext, we can create a set of words for the target word \&quot;election\&quot;:\n\n- Target word: {'election'}\n\nWe can then calculate the Jaccard Similarity score for each sentence using the following formula:\n\nJ(A,B) = |A âˆ© B| / |A âˆª B|\n\nIn our case, we're comparing each sentence set to the target word set. So for the first sentence:\n\n- J(Sentence 1, \&quot;election\&quot;) = |{\&quot;election\&quot;} âˆ© {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}| / |{\&quot;election\&quot;} âˆª {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}|\n- J(Sentence 1, \&quot;election\&quot;) = 1 / 17\n- J(Sentence 1, \&quot;election\&quot;) = 0.0588\n\nWe can repeat this process for the other sentences and compare the Jaccard Similarity scores to find the most similar sentence for \&quot;election\&quot;:\n- J(Sentence 1, \&quot;election\&quot;) = 0.0588\n- J(Sentence 2, \&quot;election\&quot;) = 0.0\n- J(Sentence 3, \&quot;election\&quot;) = 0.0\n\nThe most similar sentence for \&quot;election\&quot; is therefore Sentence 1, with a Jaccard Similarity score of 0.0588.\n\nNow let's repeat this process for the target word \&quot;Police\&quot;. We can create a set of words for each sentence in the article and for the target word \&quot;Police\&quot; as follows:\n\n- Sentence 1: {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}\n- Sentence 2: {'The', 'winning', 'candidate,', 'John', 'Smith,', 'has', 'promised', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'improving', 'healthcare', 'and', 'education', 'in', 'his', 'upcoming', 'term.'}\n- Sentence 3: {'However,', 'the', 'Police', 'Association', 'has', 'raised', 'concerns', 'about', 'budget', 'cuts', 'that', 'could', 'affect', 'public', 'safety.'}\n- Target word: {'Police'}\n\nWe can then calculate the Jaccard Similarity score for each sentence:\n- J(Sentence 1, \&quot;Police\&quot;) = 0.0\n- J(Sentence 2, \&quot;Police\&quot;) = 0.0\n- J(Sentence 3, \&quot;Police\&quot;) = |{\&quot;Police\&quot;, \&quot;Association\&quot;, \&quot;has\&quot;, \&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, you are provided with a table containing information about the daily price of a certain stock over the past 10 days.

Since there is no acidic ingredient mentioned in the recipe, it is more likely that the missing ingredient is baking powder instead of the baking soda. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that salt is also an essential ingredient in baking, as it enhances the flavor and helps activate the leavening agents.

The result would be 02/04/2020.\n\n2. Month DD, YYYY format:\nTo convert the date to the Month DD, YYYY format, we first need to extract the month name from the date. In this case, the month is February. We can then format the date as \&quot;February 04, 2020\&quot; using the following code snippet (assuming the date is stored as a string):\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndate_str = \&quot;04/02/2020\&quot;\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, \&quot;%d/%m/%Y\&quot;)\n\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime(\&quot;%B %d, %Y\&quot;)\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nThis will output \&quot;February 04, 2020\&quot;.\n\n3. YYYY/MM/DD format:\nTo convert the date to the YYYY/MM/DD format, we simply need to reorder the day, month and year values. The result would be 2020/02/04.\n\n4. Julian Day format:\nTo convert the date to the Julian Day format, we first need to convert the date to the Julian Day number. We can do this using the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndate_str = \&quot;04/02/2020\&quot;\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, \&quot;%d/%m/%Y\&quot;)\n\njulian_day = date_obj.timetuple().tm_yday\nprint(julian_day)\n```\n\nThis will output 35, which is the Julian Day number for February 4, 2020.\n\nNote that there are other possible date formats as well, but the above are some of the most common ones.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, you have to generate an appropriate response for the given input.

Both passages discuss the role of government in protecting citizen rights. Therefore, we could conclude that Passage B is a paraphrase of Passage A. \n\nTo write a program to automatically determine if two passages are paraphrases, we would need to use natural language processing techniques. One approach would be to use a similarity metric to compare the two passages, such as cosine similarity or Jaccard index. These measures compare the overlap in the words or phrases used in the two passages, and can indicate if they are similar. We would need to set a threshold for what level of similarity we consider to be a paraphrase, and this would depend on the specific task or application.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:23,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You are given a list of sentences.

One way to do this would be to represent each element of the list as a string and concatenate them with a separator. We can use a specific separator to identify the sub-lists, for instance, the comma (,) can be used to separate the individual elements, whereas a semi-colon (;) can be used to separate the sub-lists. \n\nHere's an example of how we can serialize the given list:\n\nSerialized string: \&quot;2,[1,5];3;4\&quot;\n\nExplanation: \n- The first element, i.e., number 2 is represented as a string '2'.\n- The second element is a sub-list, so we need to represent it as a string. It can be represented as '[1,5]'. We then add a ';' at the end of this string to indicate that this is a sub-list.\n- The third and fourth elements are simple integers, so we represent them as strings '3' and '4' respectively.\n- Finally, we concatenate these strings with a comma',' as separator to get the serialized string '2,[1,5];3;4'.\n\nNow, let's move on to deserializing the above string representation of the list. To do this, we simply need to split the string at each separator and convert the resulting sub-strings back into their original data types.\n\nHere's an example of how we can deserialize the serialized string:\n\nDeserialized list: [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]\n\nExplanation:\n- We split the string '2,[1,5];3;4' at the ',' separator to get sub-strings '2', '[1,5];3;4'.\n- We convert the first sub-string '2' into an integer data type and add it to a new list.\n- We split the second sub-string '[1,5];3;4' at the ';' separator to get sub-strings '[1,5]', '3', '4'.\n- We convert the first sub-string '[1,5]' into a list data type, by using the eval() function.\n- We convert the remaining sub-strings '3' and '4' into integer data types.\n- We add all the converted elements to the final list [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4], and thus complete the deserialization process. \n\nHere's the Python code to implement the above serializer and deserializer:\n\n```\ndef serialize(data):\n    # Convert each element to a string\n    str_data = [str(elem) for elem in data]\n    # Join all strings and separate the sub-lists with ';'\n    serialized = ','.join(str_data).replace('[','').replace(']','').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',;',';').replace(';,',';')\n    return serialized\n\ndef deserialize(serialized):\n    # Split the string at ',' and remove the brackets for easy list conversion\n    str_data = serialized.split(',')\n    # Create a new list for storing the converted elements\n    data = []\n    # Loop through all sub-strings and convert them to the appropriate data type\n    for elem in str_data:\n        if '[' in elem:\n            # For sub-lists enclosed in brackets, convert them to lists\n            sub_list = [int(x) for x in (eval(elem))]\n            data.append(sub_list)\n        else:\n            # For simple integers, convert them to int data type\n            data.append(int(elem))\n    return data\n```\n\nYou can then test the serialization and deserialization functions with the given complex data type as follows:\n\n```\n# Test serialization\ndata = [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]\nserialized = serialize(data)\nprint(serialized)\n# Output: 2,1,5;3;4\n\n# Test deserialization\ndeserialized = deserialize(serialized)\nprint(deserialized)\n# Output: [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]\n```\n\nThe final output after running the test cases should be the same as the original input.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;For this task, you are given a figure from an article and two sentences.

Each type of flour has its own protein content, which determines the structure of the dough, and its gluten content, which determines the dough's elasticity.\n\nIf salt is not available, it can be substituted with soy sauce, miso paste, or seaweed flakes. Soy sauce and miso paste have a salty flavor and contain umami, which adds depth to the dish. Seaweed flakes contain natural salts and minerals, which provide a mild salty flavor.\n\nIf butter is unavailable, it can be substituted with margarine, coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil. Margarine has a similar texture and flavor to butter but contains more water and less fat. Coconut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil have a different texture and flavor but work well in many baking recipes as a butter substitute.\n\nIf yeast is not available, baking powder, baking soda, or sourdough starter can be used. Baking powder and baking soda are leavening agents that release carbon dioxide gas when mixed with water, creating a similar rise in the dough as yeast.

We can create a table where the rows represent the elements of the array, and the columns represent the possible remainders when the sum of the elements in the array is divided by .\n\nFor example, if we have an array arr=[3,5,10] and , we can create a table like below:\n\n|     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| --- | - | - | - | - | - |\n|  3  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n|  5  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n|  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n\nIn this table, the value in each cell represents whether it is possible to form a sum of that remainder using the elements up to that row. For example, the cell (1,2) has a value of 1, which means that it is possible to form a sum of 2 using the first element of arr, which is 3.\n\nTo fill the table, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n- For any () row and column (), if () is divisble by , then () is 1, else () is 0.\n- For row 1 and any column (), if () is divisible by , then () is 0, else () is 1.\n- For each row () greater than 1 and each column (), if () is divisible by , then () is 1. Otherwise, () is the maximum of () and ()-1.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum size of a subset where no sum of any two elements is divisible by .\n\nUsing this approach, we can obtain a solution with a time complexity of , where is the length of the array.\n\nIn our example, the maximum size of a subset where no sum of any two elements is divisible by is 2, which can be obtained by selecting the elements {3, 10} or {5, 10}.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:43,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, you are given a list of ingredients and a recipe.

Firstly, you would start by selecting each character in the input string as the potential center for the palindrome (odd length palindrome) and alternatively you would select the gap between each character as a potential center (even length palindrome). Then, expand around the center and keep checking if the current substring is a palindrome. If the current substring is a palindrome, keep expanding and keep updating the length of the palindrome. \n\nHere is the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```\ndef longest_palindrome(input_str):\n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(len(input_str)):\n        # check odd-length palindromes expanding around the center\n        left = right = i\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(input_str) and input_str[left] == input_str[right]:\n            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n\n        # check even-length palindromes expanding around the gap\n        left = i\n        right = i + 1\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(input_str) and input_str[left] == input_str[right]:\n            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n\n    return max_len\n\n# example usage\nprint(longest_palindrome(\&quot;abbaxyxzdc\&quot;))\n# output: 3 (since the longest palindromic substring is \&quot;xyx\&quot;)\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first initialize the `max_len` variable to 0. Then we loop through each character in the input string, and for each character, we perform the \&quot;expanding around a center\&quot; approach to find the longest palindromic substring that includes that character as the center. We do this twice - once for odd-length palindromes and once for even-length palindromes. We keep track of the maximum length seen so far in `max_len`. Finally, we return `max_len` as the length of the longest palindromic substring.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:55,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;In this task, you are asked to categorize all of the given Yelp reviews into one of three categories: \&quot;RESTAURANT\&quot;, \&quot;FOOD\&quot;, or \&quot;SERVICE\&quot;.

However, if the visibility is low, then the person may not be able to see anything and hence, may not be able to identify the source of the sound.\n\n2. Hearing - Hearing would be helpful in this scenario, as it allows the person to hear the sound of rustling leaves and twigs snapping behind them, and thus identify that there is someone/something behind them.\n\n3.

This formula calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from `count` elements, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFor the given list of words `['cat', 'act', 'bat', 'tab', 'dog']`, the function will return `4`, since there are four pairs of anagrams: (`cat`, `act`), (`bat`, `tab`).&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:73,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You will be given a piece of text, followed by a word.

The number of digits in an integer can be calculated using logarithms. Specifically, the number of digits in an integer x is âŒŠlog10(x)âŒ‹ + 1, where âŒŠâŒ‹ denotes the floor function (i.e., rounding down to the nearest integer).\n\nHere's Python code to accomplish this task:\n```\nx = 13749574387549738649723894723847928374982374982374987239847594872938742983794827394872394872309847230847328947328947328947328947582793578925734859067573480695768056793405679304658902468790457839046587930458709346809357690358670943758609567820945601234\ny = 12345\n\nif int(log10(x)) + 1 == int(log10(y)) + 1:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    print(0)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first assign the values of x and y. Then, using the logarithmic function, we determine the number of digits in each integer by adding 1 to the floor of the log base 10 of each integer. We then compare these values using an if-else statement and print 1 if they are equal and 0 if they are not. \n\nFor the given value of x, the number of digits is 107.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You are given an array of integers.

[1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1].&quot;},&quot;assistant&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To solve this problem, we can keep track of the farthest index we can reach from the current index while iterating through the array. At each index, we can update the farthest index we can reach by adding the number of steps we can take from the current index to the current index.\nIf at any point the farthest index we can reach is less than the current index, it means that we cannot reach the last index from the current index.\n\nHere is the algorithm to solve the problem:\n\n1. Initialize the farthest index to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\n3. For each index i, if i is greater than the farthest index we can reach, return 'No'.\n4. Otherwise, update the farthest index by adding the number of steps we can take from the current index to the current index.\n5. If we can reach the last index (i.e., the farthest index is greater than or equal to the last index), return 'Yes'.\n6. If we have iterated through the entire array and haven't returned 'Yes' yet, return 'No'.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given example array [1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1]:\n\n1. Initialize the farthest index to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right:\n  - At index 0, the farthest index we can reach is 0 + 1 = 1.\n  - At index 1, the farthest index we can reach is max(1 + 3, 1) = 4.\n  - At index 2, the farthest index we can reach is max(4 + 1, 2) = 5.\n  - At index 3, the farthest index we can reach is max(5 + 2, 3) = 7.\n  - At index 4, the farthest index we can reach is 7 (which is less than index 4), so we return 'No'.\n3. The end of the algorithm has been reached and no 'Yes' has been returned, so the output is 'No'. \n\nTherefore, it is not possible to reach the last index starting from the first index of the array.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:86,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Given a list of airline tickets, find the itinerary that gives the cheapest overall price.

We can create this graph using a dictionary where each node is a key and its values are another dictionary containing its adjacent nodes and the corresponding prices.\n\nThen, we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting and ending nodes. For this problem, the starting node is the departure node of the first ticket and the ending node is the arrival node of the last ticket.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef find_cheapest_itinerary(tickets):\n    # Create the graph\n    graph = {}\n    for ticket in tickets:\n        src, dst = ticket\n        if src not in graph:\n            graph[src] = {}\n        if dst not in graph:\n            graph[dst] = {}\n        graph[src][dst] = ticket[1]\n\n    # Initialize Dijkstra's algorithm\n    start = tickets[0][0]\n    end = tickets[-1][1]\n    heap = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Dijkstra's algorithm\n    while heap:\n        cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if node in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(node)\n        path = path + [node]\n        if node == end:\n            return [path]\n        for neighbor, neighbor_cost in graph[node].items():\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + int(neighbor_cost), neighbor, path))\n\n    return []\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the given example:\n\n```python\ntickets = [[\&quot;MUC\&quot;, \&quot;LHR\&quot;], [\&quot;JFK\&quot;, \&quot;MUC\&quot;], [\&quot;SFO\&quot;, \&quot;SJC\&quot;], [\&quot;LHR\&quot;, \&quot;SFO\&quot;]]\nprint(find_cheapest_itinerary(tickets))  # Output: [['JFK', 'MUC', 'LHR', 'SFO', 'SJC']]\n```\n\nThe output is `[['JFK', 'MUC', 'LHR', 'SFO', 'SJC']]`, which is the cheapest itinerary that covers all the destinations.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:87,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;You are given a list of words (source) and another one of words (target).

Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In the context of text, each word can be represented as a vector with the frequency of occurrence of each word in the document.\n\nHere is the Python code for this task:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math\n\ndef cosine_similarity(v1, v2):\n    \&quot;\&quot;\&quot;Calculate cosine similarity between two vectors\&quot;\&quot;\&quot;\n    dot_product = sum(v1[key] * v2.get(key, 0) for key in v1)\n    norm_v1 = math.sqrt(sum(v1[key] ** 2 for key in v1))\n    norm_v2 = math.sqrt(sum(v2[key] ** 2 for key in v2))\n    return dot_product / (norm_v1 * norm_v2)\n\ndef most_similar_word(target_words, word):\n    \&quot;\&quot;\&quot;Find the most similar word in target_words for the given word\&quot;\&quot;\&quot;\n    word_freq = Counter(word.split())\n    target_freqs = [Counter(t.split()) for t in target_words]\n    similarities = [cosine_similarity(word_freq, tf) for tf in target_freqs]\n    idx = similarities.index(max(similarities))\n    return target_words[idx]\n\n# Example usage\nsource_words = [\&quot;apple\&quot;, \&quot;orange\&quot;, \&quot;banana\&quot;]\ntarget_words = [\&quot;banana\&quot;, \&quot;pear\&quot;, \&quot;peach\&quot;, \&quot;coconut\&quot;]\n\nfor source in source_words:\n    print(source, most_similar_word(target_words, source))\n```\n\nThe `cosine_similarity` function takes two frequency dictionaries and returns the cosine similarity between the word vectors. The `most_similar_word` function takes in a list of target words and a source word, and returns the most similar target word by calculating the cosine similarity between the two word vectors.\n\nIn the example usage, the source words are \&quot;apple\&quot;, \&quot;orange\&quot;, and \&quot;banana\&quot;, and the target words are \&quot;banana\&quot;, \&quot;pear\&quot;, \&quot;peach\&quot;, and \&quot;coconut\&quot;.

    """
    # Convert the input string to lowercase

    result = []
    
    def backtrack(curr, rest):
        """
        Recursively generate permutations by building each permutation from
        the current string curr and the remaining characters in the string rest.
        """
        if not rest:
            # If there are no more characters left, add the current string to the result
            result.append(curr)
        else:
            # For each remaining character, add it to the current string and recursively
            # generate the next permutation using the rest of the characters
            for i in range(len(rest)):
                next_char = rest[i]
                # Build the next permutation
                backtrack(curr + next_char, rest[:i] + rest[i+1:])
     
    # Start the recursion with an empty current string and the original string as the remaining characters
    backtrack("", s)
    
    # Sort the list of permutations and join them into a single string separated by space
    return "\n".join(sorted(result))
```

You can test the function with the sample input `abc` like this:

```
s = "abc"
print(permutations(s))
```

The output should be:

```
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba

Given an unsorted array of N integers, write a function to sort the given array using insertion sort. 10 4 2 5.</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Sure, here's an implementation of an Insertion Sort algorithm in Python to sort the given array: 

```
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr

arr = [10, 4, 2, 5]
sorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

The function `insertion_sort` takes an array `arr` as input, and sorts the array in-place using the insertion sort algorithm. 

The main idea behind the algorithm is to iterate through the array, and for each element at index `i`, we compare it with all the previous elements `j` (starting from `i-1` and going backwards), and move each previous element that is greater than `arr[i]` up one position in the array. Once we find the correct position for the current element (i.e., when a previous element is less than or equal to `arr[i]`), we insert the current element into that position.

In the implementation above, we use two nested loops to achieve this. The outer loop iterates through the array starting from index `1` (since the element at index `0` is already considered sorted). The inner loop compares the element at index `i` with all the previous elements (starting from `i-1` and going backwards), and moves each previous element that is greater than `arr[i]` up one position in the array. Once we find the correct position for the current element (`key`), we insert it into the array by setting `arr[j + 1] = key`.

Finally, we return the sorted array. 

In the example you provided, the output of the above code would be `[2, 4, 5, 10]`, which is the sorted version of the original array `[10, 4, 2, 5]`.</span></div></div>

Your task is to find the most similar sentence in the article for each target word. The similarity between two sentences is defined as Jaccard Similarity which can be calculated using the following formula:. Target words = ['election', 'Police'].</span></div></div>
							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">Sure, I can help you with that!

Here's an example article that we can use to find the most similar sentence for each target word:

"Yesterday's election results saw a historic turnout, with more than 80% of eligible voters casting their ballots. The winning candidate, John Smith, has promised to focus on improving healthcare and education in his upcoming term. However, the Police Association has raised concerns about budget cuts that could affect public safety."

To find the most similar sentence for each target word using Jaccard Similarity, we'll need to first calculate the sets of words for each sentence in the article, and then compare them to the set of words for each target word. We'll then choose the sentence with the highest Jaccard Similarity score for each target word.

Let's start with the target word "election". We can create a set of words for each sentence in the article as follows:

- Sentence 1: {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}
- Sentence 2: {'The', 'winning', 'candidate,', 'John', 'Smith,', 'has', 'promised', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'improving', 'healthcare', 'and', 'education', 'in', 'his', 'upcoming', 'term.'}
- Sentence 3: {'However,', 'the', 'Police', 'Association', 'has', 'raised', 'concerns', 'about', 'budget', 'cuts', 'that', 'could', 'affect', 'public', 'safety.'}

Next, we can create a set of words for the target word "election":

- Target word: {'election'}

We can then calculate the Jaccard Similarity score for each sentence using the following formula:

J(A,B) = |A âˆ© B| / |A âˆª B|

In our case, we're comparing each sentence set to the target word set. So for the first sentence:

- J(Sentence 1, "election") = |{"election"} âˆ© {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}| / |{"election"} âˆª {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}|
- J(Sentence 1, "election") = 1 / 17
- J(Sentence 1, "election") = 0.0588

We can repeat this process for the other sentences and compare the Jaccard Similarity scores to find the most similar sentence for "election":
- J(Sentence 1, "election") = 0.0588
- J(Sentence 2, "election") = 0.0
- J(Sentence 3, "election") = 0.0

The most similar sentence for "election" is therefore Sentence 1, with a Jaccard Similarity score of 0.0588.

Now let's repeat this process for the target word "Police". We can create a set of words for each sentence in the article and for the target word "Police" as follows:

- Sentence 1: {'Yesterday's', 'election', 'results', 'saw', 'a', 'historic', 'turnout,', 'with', 'more', 'than', '80%', 'of', 'eligible', 'voters', 'casting', 'their', 'ballots.'}
- Sentence 2: {'The', 'winning', 'candidate,', 'John', 'Smith,', 'has', 'promised', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'improving', 'healthcare', 'and', 'education', 'in', 'his', 'upcoming', 'term.'}
- Sentence 3: {'However,', 'the', 'Police', 'Association', 'has', 'raised', 'concerns', 'about', 'budget', 'cuts', 'that', 'could', 'affect', 'public', 'safety.'}
- Target word: {'Police'}

We can then calculate the Jaccard Similarity score for each sentence:
- J(Sentence 1, "Police") = 0.0
- J(Sentence 2, "Police") = 0.0
- J(Sentence 3, "Police") = |{"Police", "Association", "has", "</span></div></div>

1. MM/DD/YYYY format:
To convert the date to the MM/DD/YYYY format, simply swap the day and month values. The result would be 02/04/2020.

2. Month DD, YYYY format:
To convert the date to the Month DD, YYYY format, we first need to extract the month name from the date. In this case, the month is February. We can then format the date as "February 04, 2020" using the following code snippet (assuming the date is stored as a string):

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_str = "04/02/2020"
date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%d/%m/%Y")

formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
print(formatted_date)
```

This will output "February 04, 2020".

3. YYYY/MM/DD format:
To convert the date to the YYYY/MM/DD format, we simply need to reorder the day, month and year values. The result would be 2020/02/04.

4. Julian Day format:
To convert the date to the Julian Day format, we first need to convert the date to the Julian Day number. We can do this using the following code snippet:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_str = "04/02/2020"
date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%d/%m/%Y")

julian_day = date_obj.timetuple().tm_yday
print(julian_day)
```

This will output 35, which is the Julian Day number for February 4, 2020.

Passage A states that the role of government is to protect the rights of its citizens. 

To paraphrase this, Passage B could say something like: "One of the main responsibilities of the government is ensuring that the rights of its citizens are safeguarded." 

If we compare the two passages, we can see that while the exact wording is different, the meaning is very similar. Both passages discuss the role of government in protecting citizen rights. Therefore, we could conclude that Passage B is a paraphrase of Passage A. 

To write a program to automatically determine if two passages are paraphrases, we would need to use natural language processing techniques. One approach would be to use a similarity metric to compare the two passages, such as cosine similarity or Jaccard index. These measures compare the overlap in the words or phrases used in the two passages, and can indicate if they are similar. We would need to set a threshold for what level of similarity we consider to be a paraphrase, and this would depend on the specific task or application.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To serialize the complex data type [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4], we can convert it into a string format that can be easily stored, transmitted or processed. One way to do this would be to represent each element of the list as a string and concatenate them with a separator. We can use a specific separator to identify the sub-lists, for instance, the comma (,) can be used to separate the individual elements, whereas a semi-colon (;) can be used to separate the sub-lists. 

Here's an example of how we can serialize the given list:

Serialized string: "2,[1,5];3;4"

Explanation: 
- The first element, i.e., number 2 is represented as a string '2'.
- The second element is a sub-list, so we need to represent it as a string. It can be represented as '[1,5]'. We then add a ';' at the end of this string to indicate that this is a sub-list.
- The third and fourth elements are simple integers, so we represent them as strings '3' and '4' respectively.
- Finally, we concatenate these strings with a comma',' as separator to get the serialized string '2,[1,5];3;4'.

Now, let's move on to deserializing the above string representation of the list. To do this, we simply need to split the string at each separator and convert the resulting sub-strings back into their original data types.

Here's an example of how we can deserialize the serialized string:

Deserialized list: [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]

Explanation:
- We split the string '2,[1,5];3;4' at the ',' separator to get sub-strings '2', '[1,5];3;4'.
- We convert the first sub-string '2' into an integer data type and add it to a new list.
- We split the second sub-string '[1,5];3;4' at the ';' separator to get sub-strings '[1,5]', '3', '4'.
- We convert the first sub-string '[1,5]' into a list data type, by using the eval() function.
- We convert the remaining sub-strings '3' and '4' into integer data types.
- We add all the converted elements to the final list [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4], and thus complete the deserialization process. 

Here's the Python code to implement the above serializer and deserializer:

```
def serialize(data):
    # Convert each element to a string
    str_data = [str(elem) for elem in data]
    # Join all strings and separate the sub-lists with ';'
    serialized = ','.join(str_data).replace('[','').replace(']','').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',,',',').replace(',;',';').replace(';,',';')
    return serialized

def deserialize(serialized):
    # Split the string at ',' and remove the brackets for easy list conversion
    str_data = serialized.split(',')
    # Create a new list for storing the converted elements
    data = []
    # Loop through all sub-strings and convert them to the appropriate data type
    for elem in str_data:
        if '[' in elem:
            # For sub-lists enclosed in brackets, convert them to lists
            sub_list = [int(x) for x in (eval(elem))]
            data.append(sub_list)
        else:
            # For simple integers, convert them to int data type
            data.append(int(elem))
    return data
```

You can then test the serialization and deserialization functions with the given complex data type as follows:

```
# Test serialization
data = [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]
serialized = serialize(data)
print(serialized)
# Output: 2,1,5;3;4

# Test deserialization
deserialized = deserialize(serialized)
print(deserialized)
# Output: [2, [[1, 5]], 3, 4]
```

The final output after running the test cases should be the same as the original input.</span></div></div>

If salt is not available, it can be substituted with soy sauce, miso paste, or seaweed flakes. Soy sauce and miso paste have a salty flavor and contain umami, which adds depth to the dish. Seaweed flakes contain natural salts and minerals, which provide a mild salty flavor.

If butter is unavailable, it can be substituted with margarine, coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil. Margarine has a similar texture and flavor to butter but contains more water and less fat. Coconut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil have a different texture and flavor but work well in many baking recipes as a butter substitute.

If yeast is not available, baking powder, baking soda, or sourdough starter can be used. Baking powder and baking soda are leavening agents that release carbon dioxide gas when mixed with water, creating a similar rise in the dough as yeast. Sour dough starter contains naturally occurring yeast, which can be used to leaven bread dough.

It is important to note that substituting ingredients may alter the texture and taste of the dish. It is recommended to test the recipe with the desired substitution before making it in bulk for best results.</span></div></div>

The rule is based on a simple mathematical formula that takes into account the day, month and year of the given date.

According to Zeller's rule, we need to follow the given formula:

dayOfWeek = (day + ((153 * (month + 12 * ((14 - month) / 12) - 3) + 2) / 5) +
            (365 * (year + 4800 - ((14 - month) / 12))) +
            ((year + 4800 - ((14 - month) / 12)) / 4) -

            ((year + 4800 - ((14 - month) / 12)) / 400)  - 32045) % 7;

Here, day is the day of the month (28 in our case), month is the month of the year (4 in our case) and year is the year (2020 in our case).

By substituting the values, we get:

dayOfWeek = (28 + ((153 * (4 + 12 * ((14 - 4) / 12) - 3) + 2) / 5) +
            (365 * (2020 + 4800 - ((14 - 4) / 12))) +

            ((2020 + 4800 - ((14 - 4) / 12)) / 400) - 32045) % 7;

By simplifying the expression, we get:

dayOfWeek = (2) % 7;

Therefore, the day of the week for the given date, 28/04/2020 is Tuesday.</span></div></div>

We have 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169, and 13^2 = 169, so this set also satisfies the Pythagorean theorem and could be the sides of a right triangle.

Set 3 - 8, 15, 17:

We have 8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289, and 17^2 = 289, so this set satisfies the Pythagorean theorem and could be the sides of a right triangle.

Set 4 - 24, 25, 26:

We have 24^2 + 25^2 = 576 + 625 = 1201, and 26^2 = 676, so this set does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and could not be the sides of a right triangle.

Therefore, the output would be True, True, True, False for sets 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum size of the subset where the sum of any two elements in the subset is not divisible by a given integer . 

One approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. We can create a table where the rows represent the elements of the array, and the columns represent the possible remainders when the sum of the elements in the array is divided by .

For example, if we have an array arr=[3,5,10] and , we can create a table like below:

|     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - |
|  3  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|  5  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

In this table, the value in each cell represents whether it is possible to form a sum of that remainder using the elements up to that row. For example, the cell (1,2) has a value of 1, which means that it is possible to form a sum of 2 using the first element of arr, which is 3.

To fill the table, we can use the following recurrence:

- For any () row and column (), if () is divisble by , then () is 1, else () is 0.
- For row 1 and any column (), if () is divisible by , then () is 0, else () is 1.
- For each row () greater than 1 and each column (), if () is divisible by , then () is 1. Otherwise, () is the maximum of () and ()-1.

The final answer is the maximum size of a subset where no sum of any two elements is divisible by .

Using this approach, we can obtain a solution with a time complexity of , where is the length of the array.

In our example, the maximum size of a subset where no sum of any two elements is divisible by is 2, which can be obtained by selecting the elements {3, 10} or {5, 10}.</span></div></div>

We can approach this problem in various ways. One possible approach is as follows:

1. Create a set of all the letters in the English alphabet.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the unique words.
3. Iterate through the input string, and for each character:
    - If the character is not in the set of alphabet letters, continue to the next character.
    - If the character is in the set of alphabet letters, create a new string and add the character to the new string.
    - If the next character is not in the set of alphabet letters or we have reached the end of the input string, append the new string to the list of unique words.
4. Check if all the letters in the alphabet are covered by the unique words. If not, go back to step 3 and repeat until all the letters are covered.
5. Return the length of the list of unique words.

Using this approach to solve the given input string "acdbbdcef," we get:

1. Set of alphabet letters: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}
2. Empty list: []
3. Iterating through the input string, we get:
   - "a": create new string "a"
   - "c": create new string "c"
   - "d": create new string "d"
   - "b": create new string "b"
   - "b": add "b" to the existing string "b"
   - "d": add "d" to the existing string "b"
   - "c": add "c" to the existing string "c"
   - "e": create new string "e"
   - "f": create new string "f"
   - End of input string, append last string "ef" to the list of unique words: ["a", "c", "d", "bd", "c", "e", "f"]
4. Check if all the letters are covered. In this case, we still need "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", and "z".
5. Repeat step 3 with the remaining letters. We get:
   - "g": create new string "g"
   - "h": create new string "h"
   - "i": create new string "i"
   - "j": create new string "j"
   - "k": create new string "k"
   - "l": create new string "l"
   - "m": create new string "m"
   - "n": create new string "n"
   - "o": create new string "o"
   - "p": create new string "p"
   - "q": create new string "q"
   - "r": create new string "r"
   - "s": create new string "s"
   - "t": create new string "t"
   - "u": create new string "u"
   - "v": create new string "v"
   - "w": create new string "w"
   - "x": create new string "x"
   - "y": create new string "y"
   - "z": create new string "z"
   - End of input string, append last string "ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" to the list of unique words: ["a", "c", "d", "bd", "c", "e", "f", "g", "hijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
6. Return the length of the list of unique words. In this case, it is 9.

Therefore, the smallest number of unique words in the input string "acdbbdcef" that contains all the letters from the English alphabet at least once is 9.</span></div></div>

Then, expand around the center and keep checking if the current substring is a palindrome. If the current substring is a palindrome, keep expanding and keep updating the length of the palindrome. 

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```
def longest_palindrome(input_str):
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(len(input_str)):
        # check odd-length palindromes expanding around the center
        left = right = i
        while left >= 0 and right &lt; len(input_str) and input_str[left] == input_str[right]:
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
            left -= 1
            right += 1

        # check even-length palindromes expanding around the gap
        left = i
        right = i + 1
        while left >= 0 and right &lt; len(input_str) and input_str[left] == input_str[right]:
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
            left -= 1
            right += 1

    return max_len

# example usage
print(longest_palindrome("abbaxyxzdc"))
# output: 3 (since the longest palindromic substring is "xyx")
```

In the above code, we first initialize the `max_len` variable to 0. Then we loop through each character in the input string, and for each character, we perform the "expanding around a center" approach to find the longest palindromic substring that includes that character as the center. We do this twice - once for odd-length palindromes and once for even-length palindromes. We keep track of the maximum length seen so far in `max_len`. Finally, we return `max_len` as the length of the longest palindromic substring.</span></div></div>

2. Hearing - Hearing would be helpful in this scenario, as it allows the person to hear the sound of rustling leaves and twigs snapping behind them, and thus identify that there is someone/something behind them.

3. Smell - Smell may not be very helpful in this scenario, as it is unlikely that there will be any specific smell associated with this situation.

4. Touch - Touch may not be very helpful in this scenario unless the person is able to feel any vibrations or movement in the ground that could lead to the identification of the source of the sound.

5. Taste - Taste is unlikely to be helpful in this scenario and does not play any role in detecting potential danger.

To check if two words are anagrams, we can sort the letters in each word and compare if the sorted strings are equal.

Here is a Python code that implements this approach:

```
def count_anagrams(words):
    counts = {}
    for word in words:
        # sort the letters in the word
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        # add the sorted word to the dictionary with count = 0
        counts.setdefault(sorted_word, 0)
        # increment the count of the sorted word
        counts[sorted_word] += 1
    
    # count the number of anagram pairs
    num_anagrams = 0
    for count in counts.values():
        num_anagrams += count * (count - 1) // 2
    
    return num_anagrams
```

Here, we use a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the number of times each sorted word appears in the list. We then iterate over the values in the dictionary and count the number of anagram pairs using the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2`. This formula calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from `count` elements, where order doesn't matter.

For the given list of words `['cat', 'act', 'bat', 'tab', 'dog']`, the function will return `4`, since there are four pairs of anagrams: (`cat`, `act`), (`bat`, `tab`).</span></div></div>

To determine whether two positive integers have the same number of digits or not, we can count the number of digits in each integer and compare them. The number of digits in an integer can be calculated using logarithms. Specifically, the number of digits in an integer x is âŒŠlog10(x)âŒ‹ + 1, where âŒŠâŒ‹ denotes the floor function (i.e., rounding down to the nearest integer).

Here's Python code to accomplish this task:
```
x = 13749574387549738649723894723847928374982374982374987239847594872938742983794827394872394872309847230847328947328947328947328947582793578925734859067573480695768056793405679304658902468790457839046587930458709346809357690358670943758609567820945601234
y = 12345

if int(log10(x)) + 1 == int(log10(y)) + 1:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

In this code, we first assign the values of x and y. Then, using the logarithmic function, we determine the number of digits in each integer by adding 1 to the floor of the log base 10 of each integer. We then compare these values using an if-else statement and print 1 if they are equal and 0 if they are not. 

For the given value of x, the number of digits is 107.</span></div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto"><span class="">To solve this problem, we can keep track of the farthest index we can reach from the current index while iterating through the array. At each index, we can update the farthest index we can reach by adding the number of steps we can take from the current index to the current index.
If at any point the farthest index we can reach is less than the current index, it means that we cannot reach the last index from the current index.

Here is the algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize the farthest index to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each index i, if i is greater than the farthest index we can reach, return 'No'.
4. Otherwise, update the farthest index by adding the number of steps we can take from the current index to the current index.
5. If we can reach the last index (i.e., the farthest index is greater than or equal to the last index), return 'Yes'.
6. If we have iterated through the entire array and haven't returned 'Yes' yet, return 'No'.

Now let's apply this algorithm to the given example array [1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1]:

1. Initialize the farthest index to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right:
  - At index 0, the farthest index we can reach is 0 + 1 = 1.
  - At index 1, the farthest index we can reach is max(1 + 3, 1) = 4.
  - At index 2, the farthest index we can reach is max(4 + 1, 2) = 5.
  - At index 3, the farthest index we can reach is max(5 + 2, 3) = 7.
  - At index 4, the farthest index we can reach is 7 (which is less than index 4), so we return 'No'.
3. The end of the algorithm has been reached and no 'Yes' has been returned, so the output is 'No'. 

Therefore, it is not possible to reach the last index starting from the first index of the array.</span></div></div>

First, we need to represent the given list of airline tickets as a graph where each airport represents a node and each airline ticket represents an edge with its weight being the ticket price. We can create this graph using a dictionary where each node is a key and its values are another dictionary containing its adjacent nodes and the corresponding prices.

Then, we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting and ending nodes. For this problem, the starting node is the departure node of the first ticket and the ending node is the arrival node of the last ticket.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import heapq

def find_cheapest_itinerary(tickets):
    # Create the graph
    graph = {}
    for ticket in tickets:
        src, dst = ticket
        if src not in graph:
            graph[src] = {}
        if dst not in graph:
            graph[dst] = {}
        graph[src][dst] = ticket[1]

    # Initialize Dijkstra's algorithm
    start = tickets[0][0]
    end = tickets[-1][1]
    heap = [(0, start, [])]
    visited = set()

    # Dijkstra's algorithm
    while heap:
        cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        path = path + [node]
        if node == end:
            return [path]
        for neighbor, neighbor_cost in graph[node].items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + int(neighbor_cost), neighbor, path))

    return []
```

Let's test the function with the given example:

```python
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
print(find_cheapest_itinerary(tickets))  # Output: [['JFK', 'MUC', 'LHR', 'SFO', 'SJC']]
```

The output is `[['JFK', 'MUC', 'LHR', 'SFO', 'SJC']]`, which is the cheapest itinerary that covers all the destinations.</span></div></div>

Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In the context of text, each word can be represented as a vector with the frequency of occurrence of each word in the document.

Here is the Python code for this task:

```python
from collections import Counter
import math

def cosine_similarity(v1, v2):
    """Calculate cosine similarity between two vectors"""
    dot_product = sum(v1[key] * v2.get(key, 0) for key in v1)

    return dot_product / (norm_v1 * norm_v2)

def most_similar_word(target_words, word):
    """Find the most similar word in target_words for the given word"""

    similarities = [cosine_similarity(word_freq, tf) for tf in target_freqs]
    idx = similarities.index(max(similarities))

target_words = ["banana", "pear", "peach", "coconut"]

for source in source_words:
    print(source, most_similar_word(target_words, source))
```

The `cosine_similarity` function takes two frequency dictionaries and returns the cosine similarity between the word vectors. The `most_similar_word` function takes in a list of target words and a source word, and returns the most similar target word by calculating the cosine similarity between the two word vectors.

In the example usage, the source words are "apple", "orange", and "banana", and the target words are "banana", "pear", "peach", and "coconut". The output will be:

```
apple coconut
orange pear
banana banana
```

where each line shows the source word and the most similar target word found.</span></div></div>

        complement = k - num

```

You can call this function with a list of numbers and a target number, and it will return `True` if there exists at least one pair of numbers in the list whose sum equals the target number, and `False` otherwise.

For example, to check whether there exists at least one pair of numbers in the list [6, 3, -1, 11] whose sum equals 10, you can call the function like this: `check_pair_sum([6, 3, -1, 11], 10)` and it will return `True`.</span></div></div>
