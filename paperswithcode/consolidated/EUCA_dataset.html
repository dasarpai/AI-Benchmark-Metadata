EUCA: the End-User-Centered Explainable AI Framework

Authors:
Weina Jin, Jianyu Fan, Diane Gromala, Philippe Pasquier, Ghassan Hamarneh

Introduction:
EUCA dataset is for modelling personalized or interactive explainable AI. It contains 309 data points of 32 end-users&#x27; preferences on 12 forms of explanation (including feature-, example-, and rule-based explanations). The data were collected from a user study on 32 layperson participants in the Greater Vancouver city area in 2019-2020. In the user study, the participants (P01-P32) were presented with AI-assisted critical tasks on house price prediction, health status prediction, purchasing a self-driving car, and studying for a biological exam 1. Within each task and for its given explanation goal 2, the participants selected and rank the explanatory forms 3 that they saw the most suitable.

More Context for EUCA Dataset
1 Critical tasks
There are four tasks. Task label and their corresponding task titles are:
house - Selling your house 
car - Buying an autonomous driving vehicle
health - Personal health decision
bird - Learning bird species

Please refer to EUCA quantatative data analysis report for the storyboard of the tasks and explanation goals presented in the user study.

2  Explanation goal
End-users may have different goals/purposes to check an explanation from AI. The EUCA dataset includes the following 11 explanation goals, with its [label] in the dataset, full name and description


[trust] Calibrate trust: trust is a key to
   establish human-AI decision-making partnership. Since users can
   easily distrust or overtrust AI, it is important to calibrate the
   trust to reflect the capabilities of AI systems.

[safe] Ensure safety: users need to ensure
   safety of the decision consequences.



[bias] - Detect bias: users need to ensure the
   decision is impartial and unbiased.



[unexpect] Resolve disagreement with AI: the AI
   prediction is unexpected and there are
   disagreements between users and AI. 



[expected] - Expected: the AI&#x27;s prediction is
    expected and aligns with users&#x27;
    expectations.



[differentiate] Differentiate similar instances: due to
   the consequences of wrong decisions, users sometimes need to discern
   similar instances or outcomes. For example, a doctor differentiates
   whether the diagnosis is a benign or malignant tumor.



[learning] Learn: users need to gain knowledge,
   improve their problem-solving skills, and discover new knowledge



[control] Improve: users seek causal factors to
   control and improve the predicted outcome.



[communicate] Communicate with stakeholders: many
   critical decision-making processes involve multiple stakeholders,
   and users need to discuss the decision with them.



[report] Generate reports: users need to utilize
    the explanations to perform particular tasks such as report
    production. For example, a radiologist generates a medical report on
    a patient&#x27;s X-ray image.



[multi] Trade-off multiple objectives: AI may be
    optimized on an incomplete objective while the users seek to fulfill
    multiple objectives in real-world applications. For example, a
    doctor needs to ensure a treatment plan is effective as well as has
    acceptable patient adherence. Ethical and legal requirements may
    also be included as objectives.



3 Explanatory form
The following 12 explanatory forms are end-user-friendly, i.e.: no technical knowledge is required for the end-user to interpret the explanation.


Feature-Based Explanation
Feature Attribution - fa    
Note: for tasks that has image as input data, the feature attribution is denoted by the following two cards:
ir:  important regions (a.k.a. heat map or saliency map)
irc: important regions with their feature contribution percentage


Feature Shape - fs

Feature Interaction - fi



Example-Based Explanation


Similar Example - se
Typical Example - te

Counterfactual Example - ce


Note: for contractual example, there were two visual variations used in the user study:
cet:  counterfactual example with transition from one example to the counterfactual one
ceh:  counterfactual example with the contrastive feature highlighted



Rule-Based Explanation


Rule - rt
Decision Tree - dt

Decision Flow - df



Supplementary Information


Input
Output
Performance
Dataset - prior  (output prediction with prior distribution of each class in the training set)

Note: occasionally there is a wild card, which means the participant draw the card by themselves. It is indicated as &#x27;wc&#x27;.

For visual examples of each explanatory form card, please refer to the Explanatory_form_labels.pdf document.

## Introduction:

EUCA dataset is for modelling personalized or interactive explainable AI. It contains 309 data points of 32 end-users&#x27; preferences on 12 forms of explanation (including feature-, example-, and rule-based explanations). The data were collected from a user study on 32 layperson participants in the Greater Vancouver city area in 2019-2020. In the user study, the participants (P01-P32) were presented with AI-assisted critical tasks on house price prediction, health status prediction, purchasing a self-driving car, and studying for a biological exam [1]. Within each task and for its given explanation goal [2], the participants selected and rank the explanatory forms [3] that they saw the most suitable.

   **Column description**:

   - **Index** - Participants&#x27; number
   - **Case** - task-explanation goal combination
   - **accept to use AI? trust it?** - Participants response to whether they will use AI given the task and explanation goal
   - **require explanation?** - Participants response to the question whether they request an explanation for the AI
   - **1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...** - Explanatory form card selection and ranking 
     cards fulfill requirement? - After the card selection, participants were asked whether the selected card combination fulfill their explainability requirement.

Please refer to [EUCA quantatative data analysis report](https://github.com/weinajin/end-user-xai/blob/master/SupplementaryMaterialS3_EUCA_Dataset/SupplementaryMaterialS2_UserStudy.pdf) for the storyboard of the tasks and explanation goals presented in the user study.

### [2]  [Explanation goal](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html)

End-users may have different goals/purposes to check an explanation from AI. The EUCA dataset includes the following 11 explanation goals, with its [label] in the dataset, full name and description

1. [trust] **[Calibrate trust](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#trust)**: trust is a key to
   establish human-AI decision-making partnership. Since users can
   easily distrust or overtrust AI, it is important to calibrate the
   trust to reflect the capabilities of AI systems.
2. [safe] **[Ensure safety](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#safe)**: users need to ensure
   safety of the decision consequences.

3. [bias] - **[Detect bias](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#bias)**: users need to ensure the
   decision is impartial and unbiased.

4. [unexpect] **[Resolve disagreement with AI](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#unexpected)**: the AI
   prediction is *unexpected* and there are
   disagreements between users and AI. 

 5. [expected] - **[Expected](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#expected)**: the AI&#x27;s prediction is
    *expected* and aligns with users&#x27;
    expectations.

6. [differentiate] **[Differentiate similar instances](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#differentiate)**: due to
   the consequences of wrong decisions, users sometimes need to discern
   similar instances or outcomes. For example, a doctor differentiates
   whether the diagnosis is a benign or malignant tumor.

7. [learning] **[Learn](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#learn)**: users need to gain knowledge,
   improve their problem-solving skills, and discover new knowledge

8. [control] **[Improve](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#improve)**: users seek causal factors to
   control and improve the predicted outcome.

9. [communicate] **[Communicate with stakeholders](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#communicate)**: many
   critical decision-making processes involve multiple stakeholders,
   and users need to discuss the decision with them.

10. [report] **[Generate reports](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#report)**: users need to utilize
    the explanations to perform particular tasks such as report
    production. For example, a radiologist generates a medical report on
    a patient&#x27;s X-ray image.

11. [multi] **[Trade-off multiple objectives](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#multi)**: AI may be
    optimized on an incomplete objective while the users seek to fulfill
    multiple objectives in real-world applications. For example, a
    doctor needs to ensure a treatment plan is effective as well as has
    acceptable patient adherence. Ethical and legal requirements may
    also be included as objectives.

### [3] [Explanatory form](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html)

The following 12 explanatory forms are end-user-friendly, i.e.: no technical knowledge is required for the end-user to interpret the explanation.


* [Feature-Based Explanation](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html/#feature)
  * Feature Attribution - fa	
    * Note: for tasks that has image as input data, the feature attribution is denoted by the following two cards:
    * ir:  important regions (a.k.a. heat map or saliency map)
    * irc: important regions with their feature contribution percentage
  * Feature Shape - fs
  * Feature Interaction - fi

* [Example-Based Explanation](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html/#example)
  * Similar Example - se
  * Typical Example - te
  * Counterfactual Example - ce
    * Note: for contractual example, there were two visual variations used in the user study:
    * cet:  counterfactual example with transition from one example to the counterfactual one
    * ceh:  counterfactual example with the contrastive feature highlighted

* [Rule-Based Explanation](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html/#rule)
  * Rule - rt
  * Decision Tree - dt
  * Decision Flow - df

* [Supplementary Information](http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html/#suppl)
  * Input
  * Output
  * Performance
  * Dataset - prior  (output prediction with prior distribution of each class in the training set)

Note: occasionally there is a wild card, which means the participant draw the card by themselves. It is indicated as &#x27;wc&#x27;.

For visual examples of each explanatory form card, please refer to the [Explanatory_form_labels.pdf](https://github.com/weinajin/end-user-xai/blob/master/SupplementaryMaterialS3_EUCA_Dataset/EUCA_explanatory_form_labels.pdf) document.

                        its variants. We use variants to distinguish between results evaluated on
                        slightly different versions of the same dataset. For example, ImageNet 32⨉32
                        and ImageNet 64⨉64 are variants of the ImageNet dataset.

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>EUCA dataset is for modelling personalized or interactive explainable AI. It contains 309 data points of 32 end-users' preferences on 12 forms of explanation (including feature-, example-, and rule-based explanations). The data were collected from a user study on 32 layperson participants in the Greater Vancouver city area in 2019-2020. In the user study, the participants (P01-P32) were presented with AI-assisted critical tasks on house price prediction, health status prediction, purchasing a self-driving car, and studying for a biological exam [1]. Within each task and for its given explanation goal [2], the participants selected and rank the explanatory forms [3] that they saw the most suitable. </p>

<p><strong>Column description</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Index</strong> - Participants' number</li>
<li><strong>Case</strong> - task-explanation goal combination</li>
<li><strong>accept to use AI? trust it?</strong> - Participants response to whether they will use AI given the task and explanation goal</li>
<li><strong>require explanation?</strong> - Participants response to the question whether they request an explanation for the AI</li>
<li><strong>1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...</strong> - Explanatory form card selection and ranking 
     cards fulfill requirement? - After the card selection, participants were asked whether the selected card combination fulfill their explainability requirement.</li>

<h2>More Context for EUCA Dataset</h2>
<h3>[1] Critical tasks</h3>
<p>There are four tasks. Task label and their corresponding task titles are:
house - Selling your house 
car - Buying an autonomous driving vehicle
health - Personal health decision
bird - Learning bird species</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/weinajin/end-user-xai/blob/master/SupplementaryMaterialS3_EUCA_Dataset/SupplementaryMaterialS2_UserStudy.pdf">EUCA quantatative data analysis report</a> for the storyboard of the tasks and explanation goals presented in the user study.</p>
<h3>[2]  <a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html">Explanation goal</a></h3>
<p>End-users may have different goals/purposes to check an explanation from AI. The EUCA dataset includes the following 11 explanation goals, with its [label] in the dataset, full name and description</p>
<ol>
<li>[trust] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#trust">Calibrate trust</a></strong>: trust is a key to
   establish human-AI decision-making partnership. Since users can
   easily distrust or overtrust AI, it is important to calibrate the
   trust to reflect the capabilities of AI systems.</li>
<li>
<p>[safe] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#safe">Ensure safety</a></strong>: users need to ensure
   safety of the decision consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[bias] - <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#bias">Detect bias</a></strong>: users need to ensure the
   decision is impartial and unbiased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[unexpect] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#unexpected">Resolve disagreement with AI</a></strong>: the AI
   prediction is <em>unexpected</em> and there are
   disagreements between users and AI. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[expected] - <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#expected">Expected</a></strong>: the AI's prediction is
    <em>expected</em> and aligns with users'
    expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[differentiate] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#differentiate">Differentiate similar instances</a></strong>: due to
   the consequences of wrong decisions, users sometimes need to discern
   similar instances or outcomes. For example, a doctor differentiates
   whether the diagnosis is a benign or malignant tumor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[learning] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#learn">Learn</a></strong>: users need to gain knowledge,
   improve their problem-solving skills, and discover new knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[control] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#improve">Improve</a></strong>: users seek causal factors to
   control and improve the predicted outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[communicate] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#communicate">Communicate with stakeholders</a></strong>: many
   critical decision-making processes involve multiple stakeholders,
   and users need to discuss the decision with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[report] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#report">Generate reports</a></strong>: users need to utilize
    the explanations to perform particular tasks such as report
    production. For example, a radiologist generates a medical report on
    a patient's X-ray image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[multi] <strong><a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/need.html#multi">Trade-off multiple objectives</a></strong>: AI may be
    optimized on an incomplete objective while the users seek to fulfill
    multiple objectives in real-world applications. For example, a
    doctor needs to ensure a treatment plan is effective as well as has
    acceptable patient adherence. Ethical and legal requirements may
    also be included as objectives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>[3] <a href="http://weina.me/end-user-xai/explanatory_form.html">Explanatory form</a></h3>
