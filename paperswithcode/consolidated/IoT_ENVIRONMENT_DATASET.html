  <title>IoT ENVIRONMENT DATASET Dataset | Papers With Code</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ABSTRACT
Recently, the technology of the fourth revolution has given the characteristics of things constantly expanding, and everything, including people, things, people, and the environment, is connected based on the Internet. In particular, the network structure is connected to various IoT devices and is changing from wired to wireless. Unlike users who operated each device, other devices can now be operated through gateways inside and outside the smart home. However, these changes have created an environment vulnerable to external attacks, and when an attacker accesses a gateway, he can attempt various attacks, including Port scans, OS&amp;Service detection, and DoS attacks on IoT devices. Therefore, we disclose the dataset below to promote security research on IoT.

1. DATASET
We provide IoT environment datasets which include Port Scan, OS &amp; Service Detection, and HTTP Flooding Attack. After setting up the environment of IoT devices, we captured packets using Wireshark.

1.2 OVERVIEW OF DATASETS


Normal (All IoT)



Duration : about 34min



Number of attacks : None



Number of packets : 125,182 packets



Description : The traffic consists of various activities of all IoT devices (NUGU, EZVIZ, Hue, Google Home Mini, TP-Link). It mainly smart speakers (NUGU, Google Home Mini) answer to questions of play music, and home cameras (EZVIZ, TP-Link) stream images to a cell phone, and smart bulb (Hue) turn on/off or control the light color of bulbs.



Normal (Google Home Mini)



Duration : about 30min



Number of attacks : None



Number of packets : 14,400 packets



Description : The traffic consists of various activities of Google Home Mini. We asked various questions and request Google Home Mini and tried to manipulate the music function through cellphone.



Port Scan Attack



Attacker : PC (192.168.10.30)



Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)



Duration : about 21sec



Number of attacks : 2 times



Number of packets : 8,866 packets



Description : The attacker did port scanning by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on.



OS &amp; Service Detection



Attacker : PC (192.168.10.30)



Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)



Duration : about 28min



Number of attacks : 4 times



Number of packets : 96,097 packets



Description : The attacker did OS &amp; service detection by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on. Attack intensity could be varied.



HTTP Flooding Attack



Attacker : PC (192.168.10.7)



Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5 : 8008)



Duration : about 6min



Number of attacks : Consistent



Number of packets : 1,126,070 packets



Description : The traffic consists of HTTP flooding packets using Flooding attack tool(LOIC) configured as 800 threads and highest speed, so the device (Google Home Mini) stuttered or disconnected from the phone application.



1.3 COMPARISON WITH IoT NETWORK INTRUSION DATASET
This dataset has similarities with our other IoT dataset (IoT Network Intrusion Dataset), so we summarized the difference of two datasets as below.

This dataset contains traffic of more various IoT devices: two security cameras, two AI speakers and a smart light hub as described in 1.1. Configuration of IoT Environment.

IoT Network Intrusion Dataset only contains traffic of two IoT devices: SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P).

There are less attack scenarios in this dataset; IoT Network Intrusion Dataset includes MITM, flooding attacks besides HTTP flooding, and telnet bruteforce, which are not in this dataset.

Also, HTTP flooding attacks are in both datasets, but have different attackers and targets.

In the case of this dataset, the attacker is the laptop and the target is the IoT device (Google Home Mini).

In the case of IoT Network Intrusion Dataset, the attacker is the IoT device (assumed it is compromised by Mirai Botnet) and the target is a victim server.

It mainly smart speakers (NUGU, Google Home Mini) answer to questions of play music, and home cameras (EZVIZ, TP-Link) stream images to a cell phone, and smart bulb (Hue) turn on/off or control the light color of bulbs.\n\n\n\nNormal (Google Home Mini)\n\n\n\nDuration : about 30min\n\n\n\nNumber of attacks : None\n\n\n\nNumber of packets : 14,400 packets\n\n\n\nDescription : The traffic consists of various activities of Google Home Mini. We asked various questions and request Google Home Mini and tried to manipulate the music function through cellphone.\n\n\n\nPort Scan Attack\n\n\n\nAttacker : PC (192.168.10.30)\n\n\n\nTarget : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)\n\n\n\nDuration : about 21sec\n\n\n\nNumber of attacks : 2 times\n\n\n\nNumber of packets : 8,866 packets\n\n\n\nDescription : The attacker did port scanning by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on.\n\n\n\nOS \u0026 Service Detection\n\n\n\nAttacker : PC (192.168.10.30)\n\n\n\nTarget : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)\n\n\n\nDuration : about 28min\n\n\n\nNumber of attacks : 4 times\n\n\n\nNumber of packets : 96,097 packets\n\n\n\nDescription : The attacker did OS \u0026 service detection by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on. Attack intensity could be varied.\n\n\n\nHTTP Flooding Attack\n\n\n\nAttacker : PC (192.168.10.7)\n\n\n\nTarget : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5 : 8008)\n\n\n\nDuration : about 6min\n\n\n\nNumber of attacks : Consistent\n\n\n\nNumber of packets : 1,126,070 packets\n\n\n\nDescription : The traffic consists of HTTP flooding packets using Flooding attack tool(LOIC) configured as 800 threads and highest speed, so the device (Google Home Mini) stuttered or disconnected from the phone application.\n\n\n\n1.3 COMPARISON WITH IoT NETWORK INTRUSION DATASET\nThis dataset has similarities with our other IoT dataset (IoT Network Intrusion Dataset), so we summarized the difference of two datasets as below.\n\nThis dataset contains traffic of more various IoT devices: two security cameras, two AI speakers and a smart light hub as described in 1.1. Configuration of IoT Environment.\n\nIoT Network Intrusion Dataset only contains traffic of two IoT devices: SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P).\n\nThere are less attack scenarios in this dataset; IoT Network Intrusion Dataset includes MITM, flooding attacks besides HTTP flooding, and telnet bruteforce, which are not in this dataset.\n\nAlso, HTTP flooding attacks are in both datasets, but have different attackers and targets.\n\nIn the case of this dataset, the attacker is the laptop and the target is the IoT device (Google Home Mini).\n\nIn the case of IoT Network Intrusion Dataset, the attacker is the IoT device (assumed it is compromised by Mirai Botnet) and the target is a victim server.\n\n2.

### ABSTRACT
Recently, the technology of the fourth revolution has given the characteristics of things constantly expanding, and everything, including people, things, people, and the environment, is connected based on the Internet. In particular, the network structure is connected to various IoT devices and is changing from wired to wireless. Unlike users who operated each device, other devices can now be operated through gateways inside and outside the smart home. However, these changes have created an environment vulnerable to external attacks, and when an attacker accesses a gateway, he can attempt various attacks, including Port scans, OS&amp;Service detection, and DoS attacks on IoT devices. Therefore, we disclose the dataset below to promote security research on IoT.


###  1. DATASET
We provide IoT environment datasets which include Port Scan, OS &amp; Service Detection, and HTTP Flooding Attack. After setting up the environment of IoT devices, we captured packets using Wireshark.

#### 1.2 OVERVIEW OF DATASETS
1. Normal (All IoT)

- Duration : about 34min

- Number of attacks : None

- Number of packets : 125,182 packets

- Description : The traffic consists of various activities of all IoT devices (NUGU, EZVIZ, Hue, Google Home Mini, TP-Link). It mainly smart speakers (NUGU, Google Home Mini) answer to questions of play music, and home cameras (EZVIZ, TP-Link) stream images to a cell phone, and smart bulb (Hue) turn on/off or control the light color of bulbs.



2. Normal (Google Home Mini)

- Duration : about 30min

- Number of attacks : None

- Number of packets : 14,400 packets

- Description : The traffic consists of various activities of Google Home Mini. We asked various questions and request Google Home Mini and tried to manipulate the music function through cellphone.



3. Port Scan Attack

- Attacker : PC (192.168.10.30)

- Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)

- Duration : about 21sec

- Number of attacks : 2 times

- Number of packets : 8,866 packets

- Description : The attacker did port scanning by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on.



4. OS &amp; Service Detection

- Attacker : PC (192.168.10.30)

- Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5)

- Duration : about 28min

- Number of attacks : 4 times

- Number of packets : 96,097 packets

- Description : The attacker did OS &amp; service detection by sending TCP packets with SYN flag on. Attack intensity could be varied.



5. HTTP Flooding Attack

- Attacker : PC (192.168.10.7)

- Target : Google Home Mini (192.168.10.5 : 8008)

- Duration : about 6min

- Number of attacks : Consistent

- Number of packets : 1,126,070 packets

- Description : The traffic consists of HTTP flooding packets using Flooding attack tool(LOIC) configured as 800 threads and highest speed, so the device (Google Home Mini) stuttered or disconnected from the phone application.

#### 1.3 COMPARISON WITH IoT NETWORK INTRUSION DATASET
This dataset has similarities with our other IoT dataset (IoT Network Intrusion Dataset), so we summarized the difference of two datasets as below.

This dataset contains traffic of more various IoT devices: two security cameras, two AI speakers and a smart light hub as described in 1.1. Configuration of IoT Environment.

IoT Network Intrusion Dataset only contains traffic of two IoT devices: SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P).

There are less attack scenarios in this dataset; IoT Network Intrusion Dataset includes MITM, flooding attacks besides HTTP flooding, and telnet bruteforce, which are not in this dataset.

Also, HTTP flooding attacks are in both datasets, but have different attackers and targets.

In the case of this dataset, the attacker is the laptop and the target is the IoT device (Google Home Mini).

In the case of IoT Network Intrusion Dataset, the attacker is the IoT device (assumed it is compromised by Mirai Botnet) and the target is a victim server.

                        The benchmarks section lists all benchmarks using a given dataset or any of
                        its variants. We use variants to distinguish between results evaluated on
                        slightly different versions of the same dataset. For example, ImageNet 32⨉32
                        and ImageNet 64⨉64 are variants of the ImageNet dataset.

                    <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>Recently, the technology of the fourth revolution has given the characteristics of things constantly expanding, and everything, including people, things, people, and the environment, is connected based on the Internet. In particular, the network structure is connected to various IoT devices and is changing from wired to wireless. Unlike users who operated each device, other devices can now be operated through gateways inside and outside the smart home. However, these changes have created an environment vulnerable to external attacks, and when an attacker accesses a gateway, he can attempt various attacks, including Port scans, OS&amp;Service detection, and DoS attacks on IoT devices. Therefore, we disclose the dataset below to promote security research on IoT.</p>
<h3>1. DATASET</h3>
<p>We provide IoT environment datasets which include Port Scan, OS &amp; Service Detection, and HTTP Flooding Attack. After setting up the environment of IoT devices, we captured packets using Wireshark.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h4>1.3 COMPARISON WITH IoT NETWORK INTRUSION DATASET</h4>
<p>This dataset has similarities with our other IoT dataset (IoT Network Intrusion Dataset), so we summarized the difference of two datasets as below.</p>
<p>This dataset contains traffic of more various IoT devices: two security cameras, two AI speakers and a smart light hub as described in 1.1. Configuration of IoT Environment.</p>
<p>IoT Network Intrusion Dataset only contains traffic of two IoT devices: SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P).</p>
<p>There are less attack scenarios in this dataset; IoT Network Intrusion Dataset includes MITM, flooding attacks besides HTTP flooding, and telnet bruteforce, which are not in this dataset.</p>
<p>Also, HTTP flooding attacks are in both datasets, but have different attackers and targets.</p>
<p>In the case of this dataset, the attacker is the laptop and the target is the IoT device (Google Home Mini).</p>
<p>In the case of IoT Network Intrusion Dataset, the attacker is the IoT device (assumed it is compromised by Mirai Botnet) and the target is a victim server.</p>
