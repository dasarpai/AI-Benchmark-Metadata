  <title>Rare Diseases Mentions in MIMIC-III Dataset | Papers With Code</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Data annotation
The 1,073 full rare disease mention annotations (from 312 MIMIC-III discharge summaries) are in full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv.

The data split:
* the first 400 rows are used for validation, validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv, and
* the last 673 rows are used for testing, test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv.

The 198 rare disease mention annotations (from 145 MIMIC-III radiology reports) are in test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv. To note that radiology reports were only used for testing and not for validation.

To note: a row can only be consider a true phenotype of the patient only when the value of the column gold mention-to-ORDO label is 1.

Data sampling and annotation procedure


(i) Randomly sampled 500 discharge summaries (and 1000 radiology reports) from MIMIC-III



(ii) 312 of the 500 discharge summaries (and 145 of the 1000 radiology reports) have at least one positive UMLS mention linked to ORDO, as identified by SemEHR; there are altogether 1073 (and 198 in radiology reports) UMLS/ORDO mentions.



(iii) 3 medical informatics researchers (staff or PhD students) annotated the 1,073 mentions (and 2 medical informatics researchers annotated the 198 mentions in radiology reports), regarding whether they are the correct patient phenotypes matched to UMLS and ORDO. Contradictions in the annotations were then resolved by another research staff having biomedical background.

Note:
* These manual annotations are by no means to be perfect. There are hypothetical mentions which were difficult for the annotators to make a decision (see some notes in the raw annotations). Also, they are based on the output of SemEHR, which does not have 100% recall, so the annotations may not cover all rare diseases mentions from the sampled discharge summaries.
* In row 323 from the full set or the validation set, the mention nph is not in the document structure (due to error in mention extraction), thus the gold mention-to-UMLS label is -1.

Raw annotations (with model predictions)
The two excel workbooks, 



for validation - SemEHR ori (MIMIC-III-DS, free text removed, with predictions).xlsx (annotations starting from column CX and also in the third sheet, distinct umls-ordo), and 



for validation - 1000 docs - ori - MIMIC-III-rad (free text removed, with predictions).xlsx (annotations starting from column Z), 



show the raw annotations, including each annotator&#x27;s results and notes, and the predictions of all baselines approaches/tools. The predictions were not available to the annotators when the annotations were made. Free texts of clinical notes have been removed before the publication of the data." />

Note:
* These manual annotations are by no means to be perfect. There are hypothetical mentions which were difficult for the annotators to make a decision (see some notes in the raw annotations). Also, they are based on the output of SemEHR, which does not have 100% recall, so the annotations may not cover all rare diseases mentions from the sampled discharge summaries.
* In row 323 from the full set or the validation set, the mention nph is not in the document structure (due to error in mention extraction), thus the gold mention-to-UMLS label is -1.

Raw annotations (with model predictions)
The two excel workbooks, 



for validation - SemEHR ori (MIMIC-III-DS, free text removed, with predictions).xlsx (annotations starting from column CX and also in the third sheet, distinct umls-ordo), and 



for validation - 1000 docs - ori - MIMIC-III-rad (free text removed, with predictions).xlsx (annotations starting from column Z), 



show the raw annotations, including each annotator&#x27;s results and notes, and the predictions of all baselines approaches/tools. The predictions were not available to the annotators when the annotations were made. Free texts of clinical notes have been removed before the publication of the data.">

## Data annotation

The 1,073 full rare disease mention annotations (from 312 MIMIC-III **discharge summaries**) are in [`full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv`](https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv).

The data split:
* the first 400 rows are used for validation, [`validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv`](https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv), and
* the last 673 rows are used for testing, [`test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv`](https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv).

The 198 rare disease mention annotations (from 145 MIMIC-III **radiology reports**) are in [`test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv`](https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv). To note that radiology reports were only used for testing and not for validation.

**To note**: a row can only be consider a true phenotype of the patient only when the value of the column **gold mention-to-ORDO label** is 1.

## Data sampling and annotation procedure
* (i) Randomly sampled 500 discharge summaries (and 1000 radiology reports) from MIMIC-III

* (ii) 312 of the 500 discharge summaries (and 145 of the 1000 radiology reports) have at least one positive UMLS mention linked to ORDO, as identified by SemEHR; there are altogether 1073 (and 198 in radiology reports) UMLS/ORDO mentions.

* (iii) 3 medical informatics researchers (staff or PhD students) annotated the 1,073 mentions (and 2 medical informatics researchers annotated the 198 mentions in radiology reports), regarding whether they are the correct patient phenotypes matched to UMLS and ORDO. Contradictions in the annotations were then resolved by another research staff having biomedical background.

**Note:**
* These manual annotations are by no means to be perfect. There are hypothetical mentions which were difficult for the annotators to make a decision (see some notes in the raw annotations). Also, they are based on the output of [`SemEHR`](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-SemEHR), which does not have 100% recall, so the annotations may not cover all rare diseases mentions from the sampled discharge summaries.
* In row 323 from the full set or the validation set, the mention `nph` is not in the document structure (due to error in mention extraction), thus the `gold mention-to-UMLS label` is `-1`.

                        The benchmarks section lists all benchmarks using a given dataset or any of
                        its variants. We use variants to distinguish between results evaluated on
                        slightly different versions of the same dataset. For example, ImageNet 32⨉32
                        and ImageNet 64⨉64 are variants of the ImageNet dataset.

                    <h2>Data annotation</h2>
<p>The 1,073 full rare disease mention annotations (from 312 MIMIC-III <strong>discharge summaries</strong>) are in <a href="https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv"><code>full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv</code></a>.</p>
<p>The data split:
* the first 400 rows are used for validation, <a href="https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv"><code>validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv</code></a>, and
* the last 673 rows are used for testing, <a href="https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv"><code>test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv</code></a>.</p>
<p>The 198 rare disease mention annotations (from 145 MIMIC-III <strong>radiology reports</strong>) are in <a href="https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/blob/main/data%20annotation/test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv"><code>test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv</code></a>. To note that radiology reports were only used for testing and not for validation.</p>
<p><strong>To note</strong>: a row can only be consider a true phenotype of the patient only when the value of the column <strong>gold mention-to-ORDO label</strong> is 1.</p>
<h2>Data sampling and annotation procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(i) Randomly sampled 500 discharge summaries (and 1000 radiology reports) from MIMIC-III</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(ii) 312 of the 500 discharge summaries (and 145 of the 1000 radiology reports) have at least one positive UMLS mention linked to ORDO, as identified by SemEHR; there are altogether 1073 (and 198 in radiology reports) UMLS/ORDO mentions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(iii) 3 medical informatics researchers (staff or PhD students) annotated the 1,073 mentions (and 2 medical informatics researchers annotated the 198 mentions in radiology reports), regarding whether they are the correct patient phenotypes matched to UMLS and ORDO. Contradictions in the annotations were then resolved by another research staff having biomedical background.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
* These manual annotations are by no means to be perfect. There are hypothetical mentions which were difficult for the annotators to make a decision (see some notes in the raw annotations). Also, they are based on the output of <a href="https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-SemEHR"><code>SemEHR</code></a>, which does not have 100% recall, so the annotations may not cover all rare diseases mentions from the sampled discharge summaries.
* In row 323 from the full set or the validation set, the mention <code>nph</code> is not in the document structure (due to error in mention extraction), thus the <code>gold mention-to-UMLS label</code> is <code>-1</code>.</p>
