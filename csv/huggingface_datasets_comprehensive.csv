chintagunta85/bc4chemd,,,,,,,https://huggingface.co/datasets/chintagunta85/bc4chemd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable. Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation, family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of 91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts) we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from 17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER corpus and annotation guidelines are available at: http://www.biocreative.org/resources/biocreative-iv/chemdner-corpus/"

The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second a part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag B-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2 tagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1.

The PIQA dataset introduces the task of physical commonsense reasoning and a corresponding benchmark dataset Physical Interaction: Question Answering or PIQA. Physical commonsense knowledge is a major challenge on the road to true AI-completeness, including robots that interact with the world and understand natural language. PIQA focuses on everyday situations with a preference for atypical solutions. The dataset is inspired by instructables.com, which provides users with instructions on how to build, craft, bake, or manipulate objects using everyday materials. The underlying task is formualted as multiple choice question answering: given a question `q` and two possible solutions `s1`, `s2`, a model or a human must choose the most appropriate solution, of which exactly one is correct. The dataset is further cleaned of basic artifacts using the AFLite algorithm which is an improvement of adversarial filtering. The dataset contains 16,000"

We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second a part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag B-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2 tagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1.

jinmang2/ucf_crime,,,,,,,https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinmang2/ucf_crime,,,,,,,,https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/,,,,,,,,,,,,"# Real-world Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos Surveillance videos are able to capture a variety of realistic anomalies. In this paper, we propose to learn anomalies by exploiting both normal and anomalous videos. To avoid annotating the anomalous segments or clips in training videos, which is very time consuming, we propose to learn anomaly through the deep multiple instance ranking framework by leveraging weakly labeled training videos, i.e. the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at video-level instead of clip-level. In our approach, we consider normal and anomalous videos as bags and video segments as instances in multiple instance learning (MIL), and automatically learn a deep anomaly ranking model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous video segments. Furthermore, we introduce sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints in the ranking loss function to better localize anomaly during training. We also introduce a new large-scale first of its kind dataset of 128 hours of videos. It consists of 1900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos, with 13 realistic anomalies such as fighting, road accident, burglary, robbery, etc. as well as normal activities. This dataset can be used for two tasks. First, general anomaly detection considering all anomalies in one group and all normal activities in another group. Second, for recognizing each of 13 anomalous activities. Our experimental results show that our MIL method for anomaly detection achieves significant improvement on anomaly detection performance as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We provide the results of several recent deep learning baselines on anomalous activity recognition. The low recognition performance of these baselines reveals that our dataset is very challenging and opens more opportunities for future work. # Problem & Motivation One critical task in video surveillance is detecting anomalous events such as traffic accidents, crimes or illegal activities. Generally, anomalous events rarely occur as compared to normal activities. Therefore, to alleviate the waste of labor and time, developing intelligent computer vision algorithms for automatic video anomaly detection is a pressing need. The goal of a practical anomaly detection system is to timely signal an activity that deviates normal patterns and identify the time window of the occurring anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection can be considered as coarse level video understanding, which filters out anomalies from normal patterns. Once an anomaly is detected, it can further be categorized into one of the specific activities using classification techniques. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm using weakly labeled training videos. That is we only know the video-level labels, i.e. a video is normal or contains anomaly somewhere, but we do not know where. This is intriguing because we can easily annotate a large number of videos by only assigning video-level labels. To formulate a weakly-supervised learning approach, we resort to multiple instance learning. Specifically, we propose to learn anomaly through a deep MIL framework by treating normal and anomalous surveillance videos as bags and short segments/clips of each video as instances in a bag. Based on training videos, we automatically learn an anomaly ranking model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous segments in a video. During testing, a longuntrimmed video is divided into segments and fed into our deep network which assigns anomaly score for each video segment such that an anomaly can be detected. # Method Our proposed approach (summarized in Figure 1) begins with dividing surveillance videos into a fixed number of segments during training. These segments make instances in a bag. Using both positive (anomalous) and negative (normal) bags, we train the anomaly detection model using the proposed deep MIL ranking loss. https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/method.png # UCF-Crime Dataset We construct a new large-scale dataset, called UCF-Crime, to evaluate our method. It consists of long untrimmed surveillance videos which cover 13 realworld anomalies, including Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Road Accident, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Robbery, Shooting, Stealing, Shoplifting, and Vandalism. These anomalies are selected because they have a significant impact on public safety. We compare our dataset with previous anomaly detection datasets in Table 1. For more details about the UCF-Crime dataset, please refer to our paper. A short description of each anomalous event is given below. Abuse: This event contains videos which show bad, cruel or violent behavior against children, old people, animals, and women. Burglary: This event contains videos that show people (thieves) entering into a building or house with the intention to commit theft. It does not include use of force against people. Robbery: This event contains videos showing thieves taking money unlawfully by force or threat of force. These videos do not include shootings. Stealing: This event contains videos showing people taking property or money without permission. They do not include shoplifting. Shooting: This event contains videos showing act of shooting someone with a gun. Shoplifting: This event contains videos showing people stealing goods from a shop while posing as a shopper. Assault: This event contains videos showing a sudden or violent physical attack on someone. Note that in these videos the person who is assaulted does not fight back. Fighting: This event contains videos displaying two are more people attacking one another. Arson: This event contains videos showing people deliberately setting fire to property. Explosion: This event contains videos showing destructive event of something blowing apart. This event does not include videos where a person intentionally sets a fire or sets off an explosion. Arrest: This event contains videos showing police arresting individuals. Road Accident: This event contains videos showing traffic accidents involving vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists. Vandalism: This event contains videos showing action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property. The term includes property damage, such as graffiti and defacement directed towards any property without permission of the owner. Normal Event: This event contains videos where no crime occurred. These videos include both indoor (such as a shopping mall) and outdoor scenes as well as day and night-time scenes. https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/dataset_table.png https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/method.png"

Given the nature of the new languages, which have less standardization and require more specialized professional translations, the verification process became more complex. This required modifications to the translation workflow. FLORES-200 has several languages which were not translated from English. Specifically, several languages were translated from Spanish, French, Russian and Modern Standard Arabic. Moreover, FLORES-200 also includes two script alternatives for four languages. FLORES-200 consists of translations from 842 distinct web articles, totaling 3001 sentences. These sentences are divided into three splits: dev, devtest, and test (hidden). On average, sentences are approximately 21 words long."

They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models. MultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages: 1. English 2. Spanish 3. Hindi 4. Bangla 5. Chinese 6. Swedish 7. Farsi 8. French 9. Italian 10. Portugese 11. Ukranian 12.

Experiments show that simple heuristics do not perform well on the new dataset and that two neural MRC models that had been tested on BIOREAD perform much better on BIOMRC, indicating that the new dataset is indeed less noisy or at least that its task is more feasible. Non-expert human performance is also higher on the new dataset compared to BIOREAD, and biomedical experts perform even better. We also introduce a new BERT-based MRC model, the best version of which substantially outperforms all other methods tested, reaching or surpassing the accuracy of biomedical experts in some experiments.

AI systems that can create programs as solutions to problems or assist developers in writing programs can increase productivity and make programming more accessible. Recently, pre-trained large language models have shown impressive abilities in generating new codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap rather than actual execution whereas semantic similarity (or equivalence) of two code segments depends only on their ``execution similarity'', i.e., being able to get the same output for a given input."

Although there is a long tradition of work in NLP on extracting entities and relations from text, to date there exists little work on the acquisition of business processes from unstructured data such as textual corpora of process descriptions. With this work we aim at filling this gap and establishing the first steps towards bridging data-driven information extraction methodologies from Natural Language Processing and the model-based formalization that is aimed from Business Process Management. For this, we develop the first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors and flow information. We present our new resource, including a detailed overview of the annotation schema and guidelines, as well as a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text."

With the recent availability of public, large ground-truth datasets such as PubLayNet and DocBank, deep-learning models have proven to be very effective at layout detection and segmentation. While these datasets are of adequate size to train such models, they severely lack in layout variability since they are sourced from scientific article repositories such as PubMed and arXiv only. Consequently, the accuracy of the layout segmentation drops significantly when these models are applied on more challenging and diverse layouts. In this paper, we present \textit{DocLayNet}, a new, publicly available, document-layout annotation dataset in COCO format. It contains 80863 manually annotated pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide variability in layouts. For each PDF page, the layout annotations provide labelled bounding-boxes with a choice of 11 distinct classes. DocLayNet also provides a subset of double- and triple-annotated pages to determine the inter-annotator agreement. In multiple experiments, we provide smallline accuracy scores (in mAP) for a set of popular object detection models. We also demonstrate that these models fall approximately 10\% behind the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DocLayNet is of sufficient size. Lastly, we compare models trained on PubLayNet, DocBank and DocLayNet, showing that layout predictions of the DocLayNet-trained models are more robust and thus the preferred choice for general-purpose document-layout analysis."

The HateBR corpus was collected from Brazilian Instagram comments of politicians and manually annotated by specialists. It is composed of 7,000 documents annotated according to three different layers: a binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive comments), offensiveness-level (highly, moderately, and slightly offensive messages), and nine hate speech groups (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance, partyism, apology for the dictatorship, antisemitism, and fatphobia). Each comment was annotated by three different annotators and achieved high inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, baseline experiments were implemented reaching 85% of F1-score outperforming the current literature models for the Portuguese language. Accordingly, we hope that the proposed expertly annotated corpus may foster research on hate speech and offensive language detection in the Natural Language Processing area."

RuCoLA combines in-domain sentences manually collected from linguistic literature and out-of-domain sentences produced by nine machine translation and paraphrase generation models. The motivation behind the out-of-domain set is to facilitate the practical use of acceptability judgments for improving language generation. Each unacceptable sentence is additionally labeled with four standard and machine-specific coarse-grained categories: morphology, syntax, semantics, and hallucinations."

The paradigm pretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the performance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks with minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the shared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from SSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve SUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of the frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising as SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility across SUPERB tasks. We release SUPERB as a challenge with a leaderboard and a benchmark toolkit to fuel the research in representation learning and general speech processing. Note that in order to limit the required storage for preparing this dataset, the audio is stored in the .wav format and is not converted to a float32 array. To convert the audio file to a float32 array, please make use of the `.map()` function as follows: ```python import soundfile as sf def map_to_array(batch): speech_array, _ = sf.read(batch[""file""]) batch[""speech""] = speech_array return batch dataset = dataset.map(map_to_array, remove_columns=[""file""]) ```"

We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second a part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag B-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2 tagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1.
