2018_n2c2__Track_2__-_Adverse_Drug_Events_and_Medi,2018 n2c2 (Track 2) - Adverse Drug Events and Medication Extraction Dataset,"Abstract
Objective
This article summarizes the preparation, organization, evaluation, and results of Track 2 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared task. Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it.

Materials and Methods
For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learning–based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular.

Results
A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them.

Conclusions
This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons. Incorporating the larger context or outside knowledge will likely improve the performance of future systems.",https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/,EditUnknown,"Graph, Image, Text",English,2018,,,,,,"Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Clinical Concept Extraction",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/2018-n2c2-track-2-adverse-drug-events-and,Computer Vision,Relation Extraction,Relation Extraction

Abstract:
""Recent research in computational imaging largely focuses on developing machine learning (ML) techniques for image reconstruction, which requires large-scale training datasets consisting of measurement data and ground-truth images. However, suitable experimental datasets for X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) are scarce, and methods are often developed and evaluated only on simulated data. We fill this gap by providing the community with a versatile, open 2D fan-beam CT dataset suitable for developing ML techniques for a range of image reconstruction tasks. To acquire it, we designed a sophisticated, semi-automatic scan procedure that utilizes a highly-flexible laboratory X-ray CT setup. A diverse mix of samples with high natural variability in shape and density was scanned slice-by-slice (5000 slices in total) with high angular and spatial resolution and three different beam characteristics: A high-fidelity, a low-dose and a beam-hardening-inflicted mode. In addition, 750 out-of-distribution slices were scanned with sample and beam variations to accommodate robustness and segmentation tasks. We provide raw projection data, reference reconstructions and segmentations based on an open-source data processing pipeline.""

The data collection has been acquired using a highly flexible, programmable and custom-built X-ray CT scanner, the FleX-ray scanner, developed by TESCAN-XRE NV, located in the FleX-ray Lab at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It consists of a cone-beam microfocus X-ray point source (limited to 90 kV and 90 W) that projects polychromatic X-rays onto a 14-bit CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) flat panel detector with CsI(Tl) scintillator (Dexella 1512NDT) and 1536-by-1944 pixels,  each. To create a 2D dataset, a fan-beam geometry was mimicked by only reading out the central row of the detector. Between source and detector there is a rotation stage, upon which samples can be mounted. The machine components (i.e., the source, the detector panel, and the rotation stage) are mounted on translation belts that allow the moving of the components independently from one another.

Please refer to the paper for all further technical details.

The complete data collection can be found via the following links: 1-1,000, 1,001-2,000, 2,001-3,000, 3,001-4,000, 4,001-5,000, 5,521-6,370.

Each slice folder ‘slice00001 - slice05000’ and ‘slice05521 - slice06370’ contains three folders for each mode: ‘mode1’, ‘mode2’, ‘mode3’. In each of these folders there are the sinogram, the dark-field, and the two flat-fields for the raw data archives, or just the reconstructions and for mode2 the additional reference segmentation.

The corresponding reference reconstructions and segmentations can be found via the following links: 1-1,000, 1,001-2,000, 2,001-3,000, 3,001-4,000, 4,001-5,000, 5,521-6,370.

The corresponding Python scripts for loading, pre-processing, reconstructing and segmenting the projection data in the way described in the paper can be found on github. A machine-readable file with the used scanning parameters and instrument data for each acquisition mode as well as a script loading it can be found on the GitHub repository as well.

Note: It is advisable to use the graphical user interface when decompressing the .zip archives. If you experience a zipbomb error when unzipping the file on a Linux system rerun the command with the UNZIP_DISABLE_ZIPBOMB_DETECTION=TRUE environment variable by setting in your .bashrc “export UNZIP_DISABLE_ZIPBOMB_DETECTION=TRUE”.

A2D_Sentences,A2D Sentences Dataset,"The Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) by Xu et al. [29] serves as the largest video dataset for the general actor and action segmentation task. It contains 3,782 videos from YouTube with pixel-level labeled actors and their actions. The dataset includes eight different actions, while a total of seven actor classes are considered to perform those actions. We follow [29], who split the dataset into 3,036 training videos and 746 testing videos. 

As we are interested in pixel-level actor and action segmentation from sentences, we augment the videos in A2D with natural language descriptions about what each actor is doing in the videos.  Following the guidelines set forth
in [12], we ask our annotators for a discriminative referring expression of each actor instance if multiple objects are considered in a video. The annotation process resulted in a total of 6,656 sentences, including 811 different nouns, 225 verbs and 189 adjectives. Our sentences enrich the actor and action pairs from the A2D dataset with finer granularities. For example, the actor adult in A2D may be annotated with man, woman, person and player in our sentences, while action rolling may also refer to flipping, sliding, moving and running when describing different actors in different scenarios. Our sentences contain on average more words than the ReferIt dataset [12] (7.3 vs 4.7), even when we leave out prepositions, articles and linking verbs (4.5 vs 3.6).

ABIDE,ABIDE Dataset,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by qualitative impairment in social reciprocity, and by repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviors/interests. Previously considered rare, ASD is now recognized to occur in more than 1% of children. Despite continuing research advances, their pace and clinical impact have not kept up with the urgency to identify ways of determining the diagnosis at earlier ages, selecting optimal treatments, and predicting outcomes. For the most part this is due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD. To face these challenges, large-scale samples are essential, but single laboratories cannot obtain sufficiently large datasets to reveal the brain mechanisms underlying ASD. In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative has aggregated functional and structural brain imaging data collected from laboratories around the world to accelerate our understanding of the neural bases of autism. With the ultimate goal of facilitating discovery science and comparisons across samples, the ABIDE initiative now includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II. Each collection was created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories and are being made available to investigators throughout the world, consistent with open science principles, such as those at the core of the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative.

ACOS,ACOS Dataset,"Most of the aspect based sentiment analysis research aims at identifying the sentiment polarities toward some explicit aspect terms while ignores implicit aspects in text. To capture both explicit and implicit aspects, we focus on aspect-category based sentiment analysis, which involves joint aspect category detection and category-oriented sentiment classification. However, currently only a few simple studies have focused on this problem. The shortcomings in the way they defined the task make their approaches difficult to effectively learn the inner-relations between categories and the inter-relations between categories and sentiments. In this work, we re-formalize the task as a category-sentiment hierarchy prediction problem, which contains a hierarchy output structure to first identify multiple aspect categories in a piece of text, and then predict the sentiment for each of the identified categories. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (Hier-GCN), where a lower-level GCN is to model the inner-relations among multiple categories, and the higher-level GCN is to capture the inter-relations between aspect categories and sentiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our hierarchy output structure is superior over existing ones, and the Hier-GCN model can consistently achieve the best results on four benchmarks.",,EditUnknown,Text,English,,,,,,,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-absa-on-acos,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/acos,Natural Language Processing,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

ADAM,ADAM Dataset,"ADAM is organized as a half day Challenge, a Satellite Event of the ISBI 2020 conference in Iowa City, Iowa, USA.

The ADAM challenge focuses on the investigation and development of algorithms associated with the diagnosis of Age-related Macular degeneration (AMD) and segmentation of lesions in fundus photos from AMD patients. The goal of the challenge is to evaluate and compare automated algorithms for the detection of AMD on a common dataset of retinal fundus images. We invite the medical image analysis community to participate by developing and testing existing and novel automated fundus classification and segmentation methods.

ADAM: Automatic Detection challenge on Age-related Macular degeneration

Link: https://amd.grand-challenge.org

Age-related macular degeneration, abbreviated as AMD, is a degenerative disorder in the macular region. It mainly occurs in people older than 45 years old and its incidence rate is even higher than diabetic retinopathy in the elderly.  

The etiology of AMD is not fully understood, which could be related to multiple factors, including genetics, chronic photodestruction effect, and nutritional disorder. AMD is classified into Dry AMD and Wet AMD. Dry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is not neovascular. It is characterized by progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the late stage, drusen and the large area of atrophy could be observed under ophthalmoscopy. Wet AMD (also called neovascular or exudative AMD), is characterized by active neovascularization under RPE, subsequently causing exudation, hemorrhage, and scarring, and will eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.

An early diagnosis of AMD is crucial to treatment and prognosis. Fundus photo is one of the basic examinations. The current dataset is composed of AMD and non-AMD (myopia, normal control, etc.) photos. Typical signs of AMD that can be found in these photos include drusen, exudation, hemorrhage, etc. 

The ADAM challenge has 4 tasks:

Task 1: Classification of AMD and non-AMD fundus images.

Task 2: Detection and segmentation of optic disc.

Task 3: Localization of fovea.

Task 4: Detection and Segmentation of lesions from fundus images.",https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/dt4f-rt59,EditAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0),Image,,2020,,,,,,"Fovea Detection, Optic Disc Segmentation, Optic Disc Detection","optic-disc-segmentation-on-adam, fovea-detection-on-adam",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/adam,Computer Vision,Fovea Detection,Fovea Detection

ADHD-200,ADHD-200 Dataset,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects at least 5-10% of school-age children and is associated with substantial lifelong impairment, with annual direct costs exceeding $36 billion/year in the US. Despite a voluminous empirical literature, the scientific community remains without a comprehensive model of the pathophysiology of ADHD. Further, the clinical community remains without objective biological tools capable of informing the diagnosis of ADHD for an individual or guiding clinicians in their decision-making regarding treatment.

The ADHD-200 Sample is a grassroots initiative, dedicated to accelerating the scientific community's understanding of the neural basis of ADHD through the implementation of open data-sharing and discovery-based science. Towards this goal, we are pleased to announce the unrestricted public release of 776 resting-state fMRI and anatomical datasets aggregated across 8 independent imaging sites, 491 of which were obtained from typically developing individuals and 285 in children and adolescents with ADHD (ages: 7-21 years old). Accompanying phenotypic information includes: diagnostic status, dimensional ADHD symptom measures, age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ) and lifetime medication status. Preliminary quality control assessments (usable vs. questionable) based upon visual timeseries inspection are included for all resting state fMRI scans.

AID,AID Dataset,"AID is a new large-scale aerial image dataset, by collecting sample images from Google Earth imagery. Note that although the Google Earth images are post-processed using RGB renderings from the original optical aerial images, it has proven that there is no significant difference between the Google Earth images with the real optical aerial images even in the pixel-level land use/cover mapping. Thus, the Google Earth images can also be used as aerial images for evaluating scene classification algorithms.

The new dataset is made up of the following 30 aerial scene types: airport, bare land, baseball field, beach, bridge, center, church, commercial, dense residential, desert, farmland, forest, industrial, meadow, medium residential, mountain, park, parking, playground, pond, port, railway station, resort, river, school, sparse residential, square, stadium, storage tanks and viaduct. All the images are labelled by the specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation, and some samples of each class are shown in Fig.1. In all, the AID dataset has a number of 10000 images within 30 classes.

The images in AID are actually multi-source, as Google Earth images are from different remote imaging sensors. This brings more challenges for scene classification than the single source images like UC-Merced dataset. Moreover, all the sample images per each class in AID are carefully chosen from different countries and regions around the world, mainly in China, the United States, England, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, etc., and they are extracted at different time and seasons under different imaging conditions, which increases the intra-class diversities of the data.",https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/,EditUnknown,Image,,,,,10000 images,,30,"Scene Classification, Object Detection In Aerial Images, Scene Recognition, Remote Sensing Image Classification, Transductive Zero-Shot Classification","transductive-zero-shot-classification-on-aid, scene-recognition-on-aid",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/aid,Computer Vision,Scene Classification,Scene Classification

AISECKG,AISECKG Dataset,"Cybersecurity education is exceptionally challenging as it involves learning the complex attacks; tools and developing critical problem-solving skills to defend the systems. For a student or novice researcher in the cybersecurity domain, there is a need to design an adaptive learning strategy that can break complex tasks and concepts into simple representations. An AI-enabled automated cybersecurity education system can improve cognitive engagement and active learning. Knowledge graphs (KG) provide a visual representation in a graph that can reason and interpret from the underlying data, making them suitable for use in education and interactive learning. However, there are no publicly available datasets for the cybersecurity education domain to build such systems. The data is present as unstructured educational course material, Wiki pages, capture the flag (CTF) writeups, etc. Creating knowledge graphs from unstructured text is challenging without an ontology or annotated dataset. However, data annotation for cybersecurity needs domain experts. To address these gaps, we made three contributions in this paper. First, we propose an ontology for the cybersecurity education domain for students and novice learners. Second, we develop AISecKG, a triple dataset with cybersecurity-related entities and relations as defined by the ontology. This dataset can be used to construct knowledge graphs to teach cybersecurity and promote cognitive learning. It can also be used to build downstream applications like recommendation systems or self-learning question-answering systems for students. The dataset would also help identify malicious named entities and their probable impact. Third, using this dataset, we show a downstream application to extract custom-named entities from texts and educational material on cybersecurity.",https://github.com/garima0106/AISecKG-cybersecurity-dataset,EditAISecKG: Knowledge Graph Dataset for Cybersecurity Education,,,,AISecKG: Knowledge Graph Dataset for Cybersecurity Education,https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3433/paper6.pdf,,,,"NER, Ontology Matching, Knowledge Graphs",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/aiseckg,Methodology,NER,NER

We create the puzzles to encompass a diverse array of mathematical and algorithmic topics such as boolean logic, combinatorics, graph theory, optimization, search, etc., aiming to evaluate the gap between visual data interpretation and algorithmic problem-solving skills. The dataset is generated automatically from code authored by humans. All our puzzles have exact solutions that can be found from the algorithm without tedious human calculations. It ensures that our dataset can be scaled up arbitrarily in terms of reasoning complexity and dataset size. Our investigation reveals that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4V and Gemini exhibit limited performance in puzzle-solving tasks.

AMOS,AMOS Dataset,"Despite the considerable progress in automatic abdominal multi-organ segmentation from CT/MRI scans in recent years, a comprehensive evaluation of the models' capabilities is hampered by the lack of a large-scale benchmark from diverse clinical scenarios. Constraint by the high cost of collecting and labeling 3D medical data, most of the deep learning models to date are driven by datasets with a limited number of organs of interest or samples, which still limits the power of modern deep models and makes it difficult to provide a fully comprehensive and fair estimate of various methods. To mitigate the limitations, we present AMOS, a large-scale, diverse, clinical dataset for abdominal organ segmentation. AMOS provides 500 CT and 100 MRI scans collected from multi-center, multi-vendor, multi-modality, multi-phase, multi-disease patients, each with voxel-level annotations of 15 abdominal organs, providing challenging examples and test-bed for studying robust segmentation algorithms under diverse targets and scenarios. We further benchmark several state-of-the-art medical segmentation models to evaluate the status of the existing methods on this new challenging dataset. We have made our datasets, benchmark servers, and baselines publicly available, and hope to inspire future research.

Our dataset consists of 500 word-pairs annotated by 12 human subjects, and each pair has two distinct scores for similarity and relatedness. Word-pairs are selected to enable the evaluation of distributional semantic models by multiple attributes of words and word-pair relations such as frequency, morphology, concreteness and relation types (e.g., synonymy, antonymy). Our aim is to provide insights to semantic model researchers by evaluating models in multiple attributes. We balance dataset word-pairs by their frequencies to evaluate the robustness of semantic models concerning out-of-vocabulary and rare words problems, which are caused by the rich derivational and inflectional morphology of the Turkish language.

Arabic_Speech_Commands_Dataset,Arabic Speech Commands Dataset Dataset,"This dataset is designed to help train simple machine learning models that serve educational and research purposes in the speech recognition domain, mainly for keyword spotting tasks.

Dataset Description
Our dataset is a list of pairs (x, y), where x is the input speech signal, and y is the corresponding keyword. The final dataset consists of 12000 such pairs, comprising 40 keywords. Each audio file is one-second in length sampled at 16 kHz. We have 30 participants, each of them recorded 10 utterances for each keyword. Therefore, we have 300 audio files for each keyword in total (30 * 10 * 40 = 12000), and the total size of all the recorded keywords is ~384 MB. The dataset also contains several background noise recordings we obtained from various natural sources of noise. We saved these audio files in a separate folder with the name background_noise and a total size of ~49 MB.

Dataset Structure
There are 40 folders, each of which represents one keyword and contains 300 files. The first eight digits of each file name identify the contributor, while the last two digits identify the round number. For example, the file path rotate/00000021_NO_06.wav indicates that the contributor with the ID 00000021 pronounced the keyword rotate for the 6th time.

Data Split
We recommend using the provided CSV files in your experiments. We kept 60% of the dataset for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% for testing. In our split method, we guarantee that all recordings of a certain contributor are within the same subset.

The annotations are backward-compatible with COCO as one can directly evaluate COCO pre-trained models on this dataset to estimate the efficiency or the cross-dataset generalization capability of the models. The dataset contains high-quality and temporally-dense annotations for high-resolution videos (1920 x 1200 @ 30 FPS). Overall, there are 70,000 image frames and 1.3 million bounding boxes.

Argoverse-HD is the dataset used in the Streaming Perception Challenge, which includes two tracks:


Detection-only (real-time object detection). In this track, the participants will develop single-frame object detectors as they would for COCO and LVIS challenges. The crucial distinction is that the evaluation will score latency through streaming accuracy.
Full-stack. In this track, the method is unrestricted. However, most likely tracking and forecasting will be used to compensate for the latency of the detectors.

Finally, the Motion Forecasting Dataset contains 250,000 scenarios mined for interesting and challenging interactions be- tween the autonomous vehicle and other actors in each local scene. Models are tasked with the prediction of future motion for “scored actors"" in each scenario and are provided with track histories that capture object location, heading, velocity, and category. In all three datasets, each scenario contains its own HD Map with 3D lane and crosswalk geometry — sourced from data captured in six distinct cities.

All Argoverse datasets contain lidar data from two out-of-phase 32 beam sensors rotating at 10 Hz. While this can be aggregated into 64 beam frames at 10 Hz, it is also reasonable to think of this as 32 beam frames at 20 Hz.

ArSen,ArSen Dataset,"Sentiment analysis is pivotal in Natural Language Processing for understanding opinions and emotions in text. While advancements in Sentiment analysis for English are notable, Arabic Sentiment Analysis (ASA) lags, despite the growing Arabic online user base. Existing ASA benchmarks are often outdated and lack comprehensive evaluation capabilities for state-of-the-art models. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArSen, a meticulously annotated COVID-19-themed Arabic dataset, and the IFDHN, a novel model incorporating fuzzy logic for enhanced sentiment classification. ArSen provides a contemporary, robust benchmark, and IFDHN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ASA tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of IFDHN using the ArSen dataset, highlighting future research directions in ASA.",https://github.com/123fangyang/ArSen,EditUnknown,"Image, Text",English,,,,,,,"Sentiment Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Arabic Sentiment Analysis",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/arsen,Computer Vision,Sentiment Classification,Sentiment Classification

ArtiFact,ArtiFact Dataset,"The ArtiFact dataset is a large-scale image dataset that aims to include a diverse collection of real and synthetic images from multiple categories, including Human/Human Faces, Animal/Animal Faces, Places, Vehicles, Art, and many other real-life objects. The dataset comprises 8 sources that were carefully chosen to ensure diversity and includes images synthesized from 25 distinct methods, including 13 GANs, 7 Diffusion, and 5 other miscellaneous generators. The dataset contains 2,496,738 images, comprising 964,989 real images and 1,531,749 fake images.

To ensure diversity across different sources, the real images of the dataset are randomly sampled from source datasets containing numerous categories, whereas synthetic images are generated within the same categories as the real images. Captions and image masks from the COCO dataset are utilized to generate images for text2image and inpainting generators, while normally distributed noise with different random seeds is used for noise2image generators. The dataset is further processed to reflect real-world scenarios by applying random cropping, downscaling, and JPEG compression, in accordance with the IEEE VIP Cup 2022 standards.

The ArtiFact dataset is intended to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of synthetic image detectors under real-world conditions. It includes a broad spectrum of diversity in terms of generators used and syntheticity, providing a challenging dataset for image detection tasks.

ASQP,ASQP Dataset,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) typically focuses on extracting aspects and predicting their sentiments on individual sentences such as customer reviews. Recently, another kind of opinion sharing platform, namely question answering (QA) forum, has received increasing popularity, which accumulates a large number of user opinions towards various aspects. This motivates us to investigate the task of ABSA on QA forums (ABSA-QA), aiming to jointly detect the discussed aspects and their sentiment polarities for a given QA pair. Unlike review sentences, a QA pair is composed of two parallel sentences, which requires interaction modeling to align the aspect mentioned in the question and the associated opinion clues in the answer. To this end, we propose a model with a specific design of cross-sentence aspect-opinion interaction modeling to address this task. The proposed method is evaluated on three real-world datasets and the results show that our model outperforms several strong baselines adopted from related state-of-the-art models.",,EditUnknown,Text,English,,,,,,,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-absa-on-asqp,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/asqp,Natural Language Processing,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

ASTE,ASTE Dataset,"Target-based sentiment analysis or aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) refers to addressing various sentiment analysis tasks at a fine-grained level, which includes but is not limited to aspect extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and opinion extraction. There exist many solvers of the above individual subtasks or a combination of two subtasks, and they can work together to tell a complete story, i.e. the discussed aspect, the sentiment on it, and the cause of the sentiment. However, no previous ABSA research tried to provide a complete solution in one shot. In this paper, we introduce a new subtask under ABSA, named aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE). Particularly, a solver of this task needs to extract triplets (What, How, Why) from the inputs, which show WHAT the targeted aspects are, HOW their sentiment polarities are and WHY they have such polarities (i.e. opinion reasons). For instance, one triplet from “Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is simply average” could be (‘Waiters’, positive, ‘friendly’). We propose a two-stage framework to address this task. The first stage predicts what, how and why in a unified model, and then the second stage pairs up the predicted what (how) and why from the first stage to output triplets. In the experiments, our framework has set a benchmark performance in this novel triplet extraction task. Meanwhile, it outperforms a few strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art related methods.",,EditUnknown,Text,English,,,,,,,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-absa-on-aste,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/aste,Natural Language Processing,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

This article provides a summary of the ASVspoof 2021 challenge and the results of 54 participating teams that submitted to the evaluation phase. For the logical access (LA) task, results indicate that countermeasures are robust to newly introduced encoding and transmission effects. Results for the physical access (PA) task indicate the potential to detect replay attacks in real, as opposed to simulated physical spaces, but a lack of robustness to variations between simulated and real acoustic environments. The Deepfake (DF) task, new to the 2021 edition, targets solutions to the detection of manipulated, compressed speech data posted online.

ATMs_fault_prediction,ATMs fault prediction Dataset,"The collected dataset consists of multivariate time series (MTS) data belonging to several ATMs banking along with the annotations that the operators did when they performed a maintenance task on any of the machines.

Each sample is a MTS with 144 points, associated with all the 10-minute time windows of that day and 38 dimensions. Each dimension is related to a command type and response type, where the value of each point in the time series represents the number of occurrences of the associated command and response since the last failure event., i.e. in this cycle of failure. Therefore, the time series value is accumulated until the next cycle begins. Additionally, some extra information is included for each sample, such as the cycle of failure and the machine identifier, which can be used to create data partitions without mixing different machines.

The dataset and the labels assigned to each sample was used in the original work to perform a binary classification problem addressed by ML techniques. The goal of the problem was to predict whether a failure will occur within the next 7 days, using only the information from the current day (accumulated since the last error), which is based on an event-log. 

Potential use cases of the dataset:
•   multivariate time series classification-regression-forecasting methodologies;

AugMod,AugMod Dataset,"Context
A radio signal consists in two channels, channel I (for 'In phase') and channel Q (for 'Quadrature') and can be assimilated as a stream of complex numbers.
It may convey information by coding it as a sequence of symbols sampled from a finite set of complex numbers called a ""modulation"".
There exist several standard modulations such as (non exhaustive list): BPSK, QAM, QPSK of order N, PSK of order N…

In general modulation is not directly observable from a signal.
The goal of this dataset is to detect the underlying modulation of a radio signal which may have suffer various alterations during its transmission.
This task is of interest for instance for sensing the electromagnetic environment in the cognitive radio paradigm.

This dataset is made available in the context of the paper:

The malware are sourced from VirusTotal, namely samples of Portable Executable from 2017 - 2020 that they release for academic purposes.
In total, the dataset we assembled contains 26,200 PE samples: 8,600 (33\%) goodware and 17,675 (67\%) malware.

All samples were executed in a series of Windows 7 VMware virtual machines and without network connectivity due to policy/ethical constraints. These were orchestrated through CAPEv2, a maintained open-source successor of Cuckoo. This framework is widely used for analyzing and detecting potentially malicious binaries by executing them in an isolated environment and observing their behavior without risking the security of the host system. Every sample was executed for 150 seconds, an empirical lower bound on the time required to gather the full behavior of samples.

We tried to mitigate evasive checks by running the VMwareCloak script to remove well-known artifacts introduced by VMware. Moreover, we populated the filesystem with documents and other common types of files, to resemble a legitimate desktop workstation that malware may identify as a valuable target.
The dynamic analysis output is a detailed report with information on the syscalls invoked by the binary and all the relative flags and arguments, as well as all interactions with the file system, registry, network, and other key elements of the operating system.

AWARE,AWARE Dataset,"The peer-reviewed paper of AWARE dataset is published in ASEW 2021, and can be accessed through: http://doi.org/10.1109/ASEW52652.2021.00049. Kindly cite this paper when using AWARE dataset.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the opinion (sentiment) with respect to a specific aspect. Since there is a lack of smartphone apps reviews dataset that is annotated to support the ABSA task, we present AWARE: ABSA Warehouse of Apps REviews.

AWARE contains apps reviews from three different domains (Productivity, Social Networking, and Games), as each domain has its distinct functionalities and audience. Each sentence is annotated with three labels, as follows: 

Aspect Term: a term that exists in the sentence and describes an aspect of the app that is expressed by the sentiment. A term value of “N/A” means that the term is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence.
Aspect Category: one of the pre-defined set of domain-specific categories that represent an aspect of the app (e.g., security, usability, etc.).
Sentiment: positive or negative.
Note: games domain does not contain aspect terms.

We provide a comprehensive dataset of 11323 sentences from the three domains, where each sentence is additionally annotated with a Boolean value indicating whether the sentence expresses a positive/negative opinion. In addition, we provide three separate datasets, one for each domain, containing only sentences that express opinions. The file named “AWARE_metadata.csv” contains a description of the dataset’s columns.

How AWARE can be used?

We designed AWARE such that it can be used to serve various tasks. The tasks can be, but are not limited to:

Sentiment Analysis.
Aspect Term Extraction.
Aspect Category Classification.
Aspect Sentiment Analysis.
Explicit/Implicit Aspect Term Classification.
Opinion/Not-Opinion Classification.
Furthermore, researchers can experiment with and investigate the effects of different domains on users' feedback.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5528481,EditUnknown,"Image, Text",English,2021,,,11323 sentences,,,"Sentiment Analysis, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Term Extraction, Aspect Category Detection, Aspect Category Polarity, Aspect Term Extraction and Sentiment Classification","aspect-category-detection-on-aware, aspect-category-polarity-on-aware, term-extraction-on-aware",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/aware,Computer Vision,Sentiment Analysis,Sentiment Analysis

A_Billion_Ways_to_Grasp,A Billion Ways to Grasp Dataset,"Robot grasping is often formulated as a learning problem. With the increasing speed and quality of physics simulations, generating large-scale grasping data sets that feed learning algorithms is becoming more and more popular. An often overlooked question is how to generate the grasps that make up these data sets. In this paper, we review, classify, and compare different grasp sampling strategies. Our evaluation is based on a fine-grained discretization of SE(3) and uses physics-based simulation to evaluate the quality and robustness of the corresponding parallel-jaw grasps. Specifically, we consider more than 1 billion grasps for each of the 21 objects from the YCB data set. This dense data set lets us evaluate existing sampling schemes w.r.t. their bias and efficiency. Our experiments show that some popular sampling schemes contain significant bias and do not cover all possible ways an object can be grasped.",https://sites.google.com/view/abillionwaystograsp/,EditCC BY-NC,"Text, Time Series",English,,,,,,,"Grasp Generation, Robotic Grasping, Grasp Contact Prediction",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/a-billion-ways-to-grasp,Natural Language Processing,Grasp Generation,Grasp Generation

BC7_NLM-Chem,BC7 NLM-Chem Dataset,"Full-text chemical identification and indexing in PubMed articles.

Identifying named entities is an important building block for many complex knowledge extraction tasks. Errors in identifying relevant biomedical entities is a key impediment to accurate article retrieval, classification, and further understanding of textual semantics, such as relation extraction. Chemical entities appear throughout the biomedical research literature and are one of the entity types most frequently searched in PubMed. Accurate automated identification of the chemicals mentioned in journal publications has the potential to translate to improvements in many downstream NLP tasks and biomedical fields; in the near-term, specifically in the retrieval of relevant articles, greatly assisting researchers, indexers, and curators.

The NLM-CHEM track will consist of two tasks. Participants can choose to participate in either one or both. These tasks are:

Chemical identification in full text: predicting all chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles, both span (i.e. named entity recognition) and normalization (i.e. entity linking) using MeSH.

BCNB,BCNB Dataset,"Breast cancer (BC) has become the greatest threat to women’s health worldwide. Clinically, identification of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis and other tumor clinical characteristics such as ER, PR, and so on, are important for evaluating the prognosis and guiding the treatment for BC patients.

Several studies intended to predict the ALN status and other tumor clinical characteristics by clinicopathological data and genetic testing score. However, due to the relatively poor predictive values and high genetic testing costs, these methods are often limited. Recently, deep learning (DL) has enabled rapid advances in computational pathology, DL can perform high-throughput feature extraction on medical images and analyze the correlation between primary tumor features and above status. So far, there is no relevant research on preoperatively predicting ALN metastasis and other tumor clinical characteristics based on WSIs of primary BC samples.

Our paper has introduced a new dataset of Early Breast Cancer Core-Needle Biopsy WSI (BCNB), which includes core-needle biopsy whole slide images (WSIs) of early breast cancer patients and the corresponding clinical data. The WSIs have been examined and annotated by two independent and experienced pathologists blinded to all patient-related information.

Based on this dataset, we have studied the deep learning algorithm for predicting the metastatic status of ALN preoperatively by using multiple instance learning (MIL), and have achieved the best AUC of 0.831 in the independent test cohort. For more details, please review our paper. 

There are WSIs of 1058 patients,  and only part of tumor regions are annotated in WSIs. Except for the WSIs, we have also provided the clinical characteristics of each patient, which includes age, tumor size, tumor type, ER, PR, HER2, HER2 expression, histological grading, surgical, Ki67, molecular subtype, number of lymph node metastases, and the metastatic status of axillary lymph node (ALN). The dataset has been desensitized, and not contained the privacy information of patients.

Based on this dataset, we have studied the prediction of the metastatic status of axillary lymph node (ALN) in our paper, which is a weakly supervised classification task. However, other researches based on our dataset are also feasible, such as the prediction of histological grading, molecular subtype, HER2, ER, and PR.

BEAT,BEAT Dataset,"BEAT has i) 76 hours, high-quality, multi-modal data captured from 30 speakers talking with eight different emotions and in four different languages, ii) 32 millions frame-level emotion and semantic relevance annotations.
Our statistical analysis on BEAT demonstrates the correlation of conversational gestures with \textit{facial expressions}, \textit{emotions}, and \textit{semantics}, in addition to the known correlation with \textit{audio}, \textit{text}, and \textit{speaker identity}.
Based on this observation, we propose a baseline model, \textbf{Ca}scaded \textbf{M}otion \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{(CaMN)}, which consists of above six modalities modeled in a cascaded architecture for gesture synthesis. To evaluate the semantic relevancy, we introduce a metric, Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (\textbf{SRGR}). 
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate metrics' validness, ground truth data quality, and baseline's state-of-the-art performance. 
To the best of our knowledge, BEAT is the largest motion capture dataset for investigating human gestures, which may contribute to a number of different research fields, including controllable gesture synthesis, cross-modality analysis, and emotional gesture recognition.

To achieve this, we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME), a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines MoShed SMPLX body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head, neck, and finger movements, offering a community-standardized, high-quality 3D motion captured dataset.  EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer, facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements.  Moreover, EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs, generating complete, audio-synchronized results.",https://pantomatrix.github.io/EMAGE/,EditCC-BY-NC-4.0,"3D, Image, Text",English,,,,,,,"Gesture Generation, 3D Face Animation","3d-face-animation-on-beat2, gesture-generation-on-beat2",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/beat2,Computer Vision,Gesture Generation,Gesture Generation

BillSum,BillSum Dataset,"BillSum is the first dataset for summarization of US Congressional and California state bills.

The BillSum dataset consists of three parts: US training bills, US test bills and California test bills. The US bills were collected from the Govinfo service provided by the United States Government Publishing Office (GPO). The corpus consists of bills from the 103rd-115th (1993-2018) sessions of Congress. The data was split into 18,949 train bills and 3,269 test bills. For California, bills from the 2015-2016 session were scraped directly from the legislature’s website; the summaries were written by their Legislative Counsel.

The BillSum corpus focuses on mid-length legislation from 5,000 to 20,000 character in length. The authors chose to measure the text length in characters, instead of words or sentences, because the texts have complex structure that makes it difficult to consistently measure words. The range was chosen because on one side, short bills introduce minor changes and do not require summaries. While the CRS produces summaries for them, they often contain most of the text of the bill. On the
other side, very long legislation is often composed of several large sections.",https://github.com/FiscalNote/BillSum,EditUnknown,"Text, Time Series",English,1993,BillSum: A Corpus for Automatic Summarization of US Legislation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00523v2.pdf,,,,"Sequence-to-sequence Language Modeling, Text Summarization, Abstractive Text Summarization, Summarization, Point Processes","text-summarization-on-billsum, sequence-to-sequence-language-modeling-on-3, summarization-on-billsum",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/billsum,Natural Language Processing,Sequence-to-sequence Language Modeling,Sequence-to-sequence Language Modeling

Binette_s_2022_Inventors_Benchmark,Binette's 2022 Inventors Benchmark Dataset,"Hand-disambiguation of a sample of U.S. patents inventor mentions from PatentsView.org.

Inventors we selected indirectly by sampling inventor mentions uniformly at random. This results in inventor sampled with probability proportional to their number of granted patents.

The time period considered is from 1976 to December 31, 2021, corresponding to the disambiguation labeled ""disamb_inventor_id_20211230"" in PatentsView's bulk data downloads ""g_persistent_inventor.tsv"" file (https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables). That is, the benchmark disambiguation intends to contain all inventor mentions for the sampled inventors from that time period. Note that the benchmark disambiguation contains a few extraneous mentions to patents granted outside of that time period. These should be ignored for evaluation purposes.

The methodology used for the hand-disambiguation is described in Binette et al. (2022) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01230). We used one disambiguation of 200 inventors from Binette et al. (2022), as well as an additional disambiguation of 200 inventors provided by an additional staff member. The two disambiguations were reviewed and validated. However, they should be expected to contain errors due to the ambiguous nature of inventor disambiguation. Furthermore, given the use as the December 30, 2021, disambiguation from PatentsView as a starting point of the hand-labeling, a bias towards this disambiguation should be expected.",https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Evaluation/,EditUnknown,,,1976,,,,,,"Record linking, Entity Resolution",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/binette-s-2022-inventors-benchmark,Methodology,Record linking,Record linking

The dataset includes numerical data representing ablation profiles, captured as a large CSV file, and audio recordings captured using a high-resolution microphone. Ablation profiles are measured at standoff distances that span several discrete lengths, ensuring diverse sample conditions. The audio data derives from high-fidelity recordings at a 38.4 kHz sampling rate in .wav format, capturing the fluid jet's impact sounds as it interacts initially with a metal plate and subsequently with the bone cement. This audio information was processed into Mel Spectrograms, which efficiently capture the frequency distribution crucial for predictive analysis. The dataset is organized into training and testing subsets, with the initial portions used to train predictive models leveraging Mel Spectrogram inputs to predict erosion profiles. This dataset offers insights into the dynamic interactions between a pulsating fluid jet and target materials, providing a foundation for predictive modeling in non-invasive surgical procedures.",https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/bone-cement-removal-audio-monitoring-and-erosion-depth,EditCreative Commons Attribution,Time Series,,,,,,,,Prediction,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/bone-cement-removal-with-audio-monitoring,Methodology,Prediction,Prediction

Each example is a triplet of (question, passage, answer), with the title of the page as optional additional context.

Questions are gathered from anonymized, aggregated queries to the Google search engine. Queries that are likely to be yes/no questions are heuristically identified and questions are only kept if a Wikipedia page is returned as one of the first five results, in which case the question and Wikipedia page are given to a human annotator for further processing. Annotators label question/article pairs in a three-step process. First, they decide if the question is good, meaning it is comprehensible, unambiguous, and requesting factual information. This judgment is made before the annotator sees the Wikipedia page. Next, for good questions, annotators find a passage within the document that contains enough information to answer the question. Annotators can mark questions as “not answerable” if the Wikipedia article does not contain the requested information. Finally, annotators mark whether the question’s answer is “yes” or “no”.

Breast_Lesion_Detection_in_Ultrasound_Videos__CVA-,Breast Lesion Detection in Ultrasound Videos (CVA-Net) Dataset,"The breast lesion detection in ultrasound videos dataset uses a clip-level and video-level feature aggregated network (CVA-Net) and consists of 188 ultrasound videos, of which 113 are labeled malignant and 75 benign. Overall these consist of 25,272 ultrasound images in total with the number of images for each video varying from 28 to 413. 150 videos were used for training, 38 for testing. The primary intended use case would be for computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis, supporting systems to assist radiologists.

Here are more details summarising the approach:


A novel network: a new state-of-the-art clip-level and video level feature aggregated network (CVA-Net) created to aggregate clip-level temporal features and video-level lesion classification features to fuse and into a prediction classifier. It outperformed existing methods mainly focused on 2D images and or fusing with unlabeled videos.
The need for increased accuracy contributed to the motivation, given detection challenges due to blurry breast lesion boundaries, inhomogeneous distributions, changeable breast lesion sizes, and positions in dynamic video.
Each video has a complete scan of the tumor, from where it becomes visible to where it is no longer visible as well as the largest section - all acquired via LOGIQ-E9 and PHILIPS TIS L9-3 ultrasound machines .
2 pathologists with 8 years of experience invited to manually annotate the breast lesion rectangles inside each frame and give the corresponding classification.

Cadenza_Woodwind,Cadenza Woodwind Dataset,"This publicly available data is synthesised audio for woodwind quartets including renderings of each instrument in isolation. The data was created to be used as training data within Cadenza's second open machine learning challenge (CAD2) for the task on rebalancing classical music ensembles. The dataset is also intended for developing other music information retrieval (MIR) algorithms using machine learning. It was created because of the lack of large-scale datasets of classical woodwind music with separate audio for each instrument and permissive license for reuse. Music scores were selected from the OpenScore String Quartet corpus. These were rendered for two woodwind ensembles of (i) flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon; and (ii) flute, oboe, alto saxophone and bassoon. This was done by a professional music producer using industry-standard software. Virtual instruments were used to create the audio for each instrument using software that interpreted expression markings in the score. Convolution reverberation was used to simulate a performance space and the ensembles mixed. The dataset consists of the audio and associated metadata

Nineteen scores were randomly selected from the OpenScore String Quartet corpus. The synthesis of these as woodwind ensembles was performed by a sound engineering professional using professional software. The scores were loaded into the music notation software Steinberg's Dorico. The string parts were allocated to flute, oboe, clarinet (or alto saxophone) and bassoon.

About Dataset

Context
This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.

The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.

Content
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self-explanatory:
- longitude
- latitude
- housing_median_age
- total_rooms
- total_bedrooms
- population
- households
- median_income
- median_house_value
- ocean_proximity

Each 2D map and 3D grid has a set of labels associated to it: 2 cosmological parameters characterizing fundamental properties of the Universe, and 4 astrophysical parameters parametrizing the strength of astrophysical processes such as feedback from supernova and supermassive black-holes.

The main task this dataset was designed is to perform a robust inference on the value of the cosmological parameters from each map and grid. The data itself was generated from two completely different set of simulations, and it is not obvious that training one model on one will work when predicting on the other. Since simulations of the real Universe may never be perfect, this dataset provides the data to tackle this problem.

Solving this problem will help cosmologists to constrain the value of the cosmological parameters with the highest accuracy and therefore unveil the mysteries of our Universe.

CANNOT,CANNOT Dataset,"Dataset Summary
CANNOT is a dataset that focuses on negated textual pairs. It currently
contains 77,376 samples, of which roughly of them are negated pairs of
sentences, and the other half are not (they are paraphrased versions of each
other).

The most frequent negation that appears in the dataset is verbal negation (e.g.,
will → won't), although it also contains pairs with antonyms (cold → hot).

<br>

Languages
CANNOT includes exclusively texts in English.

<br>

Dataset Structure
The dataset is given as a
.tsv file with the
following structure:

| premise     | hypothesis                                         | label |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----:|
| A sentence. | An equivalent, non-negated sentence (paraphrased). | 0     |
| A sentence. | The sentence negated.                              | 1     |

The dataset can be easily loaded into a Pandas DataFrame by running:

```Python
import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.read_csv('negation_dataset_v1.0.tsv', sep='\t')

```

<br>

Dataset Creation
The dataset has been created by cleaning up and merging the following datasets:



Not another Negation Benchmark: The NaN-NLI Test Suite for Sub-clausal
    Negation (see
datasets/nan-nli).



GLUE Diagnostic Dataset (see
datasets/glue-diagnostic).

Can_you_predict_product_backorder_,Can you predict product backorder? Dataset,"Problem Statement

Material backorder is a common problem in a supply chain system, impacting an inventory system's service level and effectiveness. Identifying parts with the highest chances of shortage prior to their occurrence can present a high opportunity to improve an overall company’s performance. In this project, we will train classifiers to predict future back-ordered products and generate predictions for a test set.

CARLANE_Benchmark,CARLANE Benchmark Dataset,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation demonstrates great potential to mitigate domain shifts by transferring models from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been applied to a wide variety of complex vision tasks, only few works focus on lane detection for autonomous driving. This can be attributed to the lack of publicly available datasets. To facilitate research in these directions, we propose CARLANE, a 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection. CARLANE encompasses the single-target datasets MoLane and TuLane and the multi-target dataset MuLane. These datasets are built from three different domains, which cover diverse scenes and contain a total of 163K unique images, 118K of which are annotated. In addition we evaluate and report systematic baselines, including our own method, which builds upon Prototypical Cross-domain Self-supervised Learning. We find that false positive and false negative rates of the evaluated domain adaptation methods are high compared to those of fully supervised baselines. This affirms the need for benchmarks such as CARLANE to further strengthen research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for lane detection.

CASIA-CXR,CASIA-CXR Dataset,"Medical report generation (MRG), which aims to automatically generate a textual description of a specific medical image (e.g., a chest X-ray), has recently received increasing research interest. Building on the success of image captioning, MRG has become achievable. However, generating language-specific radiology reports poses a challenge for data-driven models due to their reliance on paired image-report chest X-ray datasets, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In this paper, we introduce a chest X-ray benchmark dataset, namely CASIA-CXR, consisting of high-resolution chest radiographs accompanied by narrative reports originally written in French. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public chest radiograph dataset with medical reports in this particular language. Importantly, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal encoder-decoder contextually-guided framework for medical report generation in French. We validated our framework through intra-language and cross-language contextual analysis, supplemented by expert evaluation performed by radiologists.

CASIA-Iris-Complex,CASIA-Iris-Complex Dataset,"Introduction
Iris is considered one of the most accurate and reliable biometric modality. Iris is more stable and distinctive compared with fingerprint, face, voice, etc, and difficult to be replicated for spoof attacks. Although an iris pattern is naturally an ideal identifier, the development of a high-performance iris recognition algorithm and transferring it from laboratory to field application is still a challenging task. In practical applications, the iris recognition system must face various unpredictable iris image degraded. For example, recognition of low-quality iris images, non-cooperative iris images, long-range iris images, and moving iris images are all huge problems in iris recognition. We believe that the first step in solving these problems is to design and develop a database of iris images that includes all of these degraded.

So, we clear up all the fallacious files and split the dataset into three parts. Among the 360 smear images, 300 blood cell images with annotations are used as the training set first, and then the rest of the 60 images with annotations are used as the testing set.

CBCT_Walnut,CBCT Walnut Dataset,"The scans are performed using a custom-built, highly flexible X-ray CT scanner, the FleX-ray scanner, developed by XRE nvand located in the FleX-ray Lab at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The general purpose of the FleX-ray Lab is to conduct proof of concept experiments directly accessible to researchers in the field of mathematics and computer science. The scanner consists of a cone-beam microfocus X-ray point source that projects polychromatic X-rays onto a 1536-by-1944 pixels, 14-bit flat panel detector (Dexella 1512NDT) and a rotation stage in-between, upon which a sample is mounted. All three components are mounted on translation stages which allow them to move independently from one another.

Please refer to the paper for all further technical details.

CBIS-DDSM,CBIS-DDSM Dataset,"This CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM) is an updated and standardized version of the  Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) .  The DDSM is a database of 2,620 scanned film mammography studies. It contains normal, benign, and malignant cases with verified pathology information. The scale of the database along with ground truth validation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and testing of decision support systems. The CBIS-DDSM collection includes a subset of the DDSM data selected and curated by a trained mammographer.  The images have been decompressed and converted to DICOM format.  Updated ROI segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data are also included.  A manuscript describing how to use this dataset in detail is available at https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177.

Published research results from work in developing decision support systems in mammography are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. Few well-curated public datasets have been provided for the mammography community. These include the DDSM, the Mammographic Imaging Analysis Society (MIAS) database, and the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) project. Although these public data sets are useful, they are limited in terms of data set size and accessibility.

For example, most researchers using the DDSM do not leverage all its images for a variety of historical reasons. When the database was released in 1997, computational resources to process hundreds or thousands of images were not widely available. Additionally, the DDSM images are saved in non-standard compression files that require the use of decompression code that has not been updated or maintained for modern computers. Finally, the ROI annotations for the abnormalities in the DDSM were provided to indicate a general position of lesions, but not a precise segmentation for them. Therefore, many researchers must implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. The CBIS-DDSM collection addresses that challenge by publicly releasing an curated and standardized version of the DDSM for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography.

Please note that the image data for this collection is structured such that each participant has multiple patient IDs.  For example, participant 00038 has 10 separate patient IDs which provide information about the scans within the IDs (e.g. Calc-Test_P_00038_LEFT_CC, Calc-Test_P_00038_RIGHT_CC_1).  This makes it appear as though there are 6,671 patients according to the DICOM metadata, but there are only 1,566 actual participants in the cohort.",https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629,EditCC BY-SA 3.0,Image,,1997,,,,,,"Cancer-no cancer per breast classification, Breast Cancer Detection, Cancer-no cancer per image classification","cancer-no-cancer-per-image-classification-on, cancer-no-cancer-per-breast-classification-on",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cbis-ddsm,Computer Vision,Cancer-no cancer per breast classification,Cancer-no cancer per breast classification

To push the boundaries of multimodal models, we present a new IR task: \textbf{Text2Mol}.

Given a text query and list of molecules without any reference textual information (represented, for example, as SMILES strings, graphs, or other equivalent representations) retrieve the molecule corresponding to the query. From a text description of a molecule, the model must incorporate the information in the description into a semantic representation which can be used to directly retrieve the molecule. This requires the integration of two very different types of information: the structured knowledge represented by text and the chemical properties present in molecular graphs. We assume there is only one correct (relevant) molecule for each description, so we consider two measures for this task: Hits@1 and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

CHiME-Home,CHiME-Home Dataset,"CHiME-Home is a dataset for sound source recognition in a domestic environment. It uses around 6.8 hours of domestic environment audio recordings. The recordings were obtained from the CHiME projects – computational hearing in multisource environments – where recording equipment was positioned inside an English Victorian semi-detached house. The recordings were selected from 22 sessions totalling 19.5 hours, with each session made between 7:30 in the morning and 20:00 in the evening. In the considered recordings, the equipment was placed in the lounge (sitting room) near the door opening onto a hallway, with the hallway opening onto a kitchen with no door. With the lounge door typically open, prominent sounds thus may originate from sources both in the lounge and kitchen.

The choice of permitted labels was motivated by the sources present in the considered acoustic environment: Human speakers (c,m,f); human activity (p); television (v); household appliances (b). Further labels o,S,U respectively relate to any other identifiable sounds, silence, unidentifiable sounds. Labels S,U may respectively only be assigned in isolation. Annotators were acquired to assign at least one label to a chunk, thus annotators may either assign one or more labels from the set {c,m,f,v,p,b,o}, or may alternatively ‘flag’ the chunk using a single label from the set {S,U}.",https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/chime-home-dataset-annotation-and-baseline-evaluation-code,EditUnknown,"Audio, Image",,,,,,,,"Audio Tagging, Multi-Label Classification",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/chime-home,Audio,Audio Tagging,Audio Tagging

CICIDS2017,CICIDS2017 Dataset,"Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017)
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are the most important defense tools against the sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to the lack of reliable test and validation datasets, anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches are suffering from consistent and accurate performance evolutions.

Our evaluations of the existing eleven datasets since 1998 show that most are out of date and unreliable. Some of these datasets suffer from the lack of traffic diversity and volumes, some do not cover the variety of known attacks, while others anonymize packet payload data, which cannot reflect the current trends. Some are also lacking feature set and metadata.

CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source, and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack (CSV files). Also available is the extracted features definition. 

Generating realistic background traffic was our top priority in building this dataset. We have used our proposed B-Profile system (Sharafaldin, et al. 2016) to profile the abstract behavior of human interactions and generates naturalistic benign background traffic. For this dataset, we built the abstract behaviour of 25 users based on the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and email protocols.

The data capturing period started at 9 a.m., Monday, July 3, 2017 and ended at 5 p.m. on Friday July 7, 2017, for a total of 5 days. Monday is the normal day and only includes the benign traffic. The implemented attacks include Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Heartbleed, Web Attack, Infiltration, Botnet and DDoS. They have been executed both morning and afternoon on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

In our recent dataset evaluation framework (Gharib et al., 2016), we have identified eleven criteria that are necessary for building a reliable benchmark dataset. None of the previous IDS datasets could cover all of the 11 criteria. In the following, we briefly outline these criteria:

Complete Network configuration: A complete network topology includes Modem, Firewall, Switches, Routers, and presence of a variety of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

Complete Traffic: By having a user profiling agent and 12 different machines in Victim-Network and real attacks from the Attack-Network.

Labelled Dataset: Section 4 and Table 2 show the benign and attack labels for each day. Also, the details of the attack timing will be published on the dataset document.

Complete Interaction: As Figure 1 shows, we covered both within and between internal LAN by having two different networks and Internet communication as well.

Complete Capture: Because we used the mirror port, such as tapping system, all traffics have been captured and recorded on the storage server.

Available Protocols: Provided the presence of all common available protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH and email protocols.

Attack Diversity: Included the most common attacks based on the 2016 McAfee report, such as Web based, Brute force, DoS, DDoS, Infiltration, Heart-bleed, Bot and Scan covered in this dataset.

Heterogeneity: Captured the network traffic from the main Switch and memory dump and system calls from all victim machines, during the attacks execution.

Feature Set: Extracted more than 80 network flow features from the generated network traffic using CICFlowMeter and delivered the network flow dataset as a CSV file. See our PCAP analyzer and CSV generator.

MetaData: Completely explained the dataset which includes the time, attacks, flows and labels in the published paper.

This project aims to generate a state-of-the-art dataset for profiling, behavioural analysis, and vulnerability testing of different IoT devices with different protocols such as IEEE 802.11, Zigbee-based and Z-Wave. The following illustrates the main objectives of the CIC-IoT dataset project:


Configure various IoT devices and analyze the behaviour exhibited.
Conduct manual and semi-automated experiments of various categories.
Further analyze the network traffic when the devices are idle for three minutes and when powered on for the first two minutes.
Generating different scenarios and analyzing the devices' behaviour in different situations.
Conducting and capturing the network terrific of devices undercurrent and important attacks in IoT environment.

Current CIC IoT dataset project and activities around it can be summarized in the following steps:

Network configuration
Our lab network configuration was configured with a 64-bit Window machine with two network interface cards - one is connected to the network gateway, and the other is connected to an unmanaged network switch. Simultaneously, Wireshark, the open-source network protocol analyzer, listens to both interfaces, captures and saves the output packet captured (pcap) files. Hence, IoT devices that require an Ethernet connection are connected to this switch. Additionally, a smart automation hub, Vera Plus is also connected to the unmanaged switch, which creates our wireless IoT environment to serve IoT devices compatible with Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Z-Wave and Bluetooth.



Dataset
For collecting the data, we captured the network traffic of the IoT devices coming through the gateway using Wireshark and dumpcap in six different types of experiments. The former was used for manual experiments, while the latter was used for semi-automated ones. All the experiments can be organized as follows:



Power:  In this experiment, we powered on all the devices in our lab individually and started a network traffic capture in isolation.



Idle:  In this experiment, we captured the whole network traffic from late in the evening to early in the morning, which we call idle time. In this period, the whole lab was completely evacuated and there were no human interactions involved.



Interactions:  In this experiment, all possible functionality on IoT devices has been extracted and the corresponding network activity and transmitted packets for each functionality/activity have been captured.



Scenarios:  In these experiments, we conducted six different types of scenario experiments using a combination of devices as simulations of the network activity inside a smart home. These experiments were done to see how devices behave while interacting with each other simultaneously.



Active:  In addition to the idle time, the whole network communications were also captured throughout the day. All fellow researchers during this period were allowed to enter the lab whenever they wanted. They might interact with devices and generate network traffic either passively or actively.



Attacks:  In this experiment, we performed two different attacks, Flood and RTSP- Brute Force, on some of our devices and captured their attack network traffic.



Case study – device identification
After generating the dataset, we performed a case study on the idea of transferability – training datasets in our lab and transferring the trained model to another lab for testing. We conducted 20 different experiments based on the number of sampled devices from the United States lab.

Forty-eight features were extracted from both the training dataset from our lab and the testing dataset from the other lab. Three classes of device types were used in this experiment: Audio, Camera and Home Automation. However, no labels were required for the test dataset since that was what was to be predicted but the training dataset required labels.

After training, the model is transferred to the other lab for testing on each device to predict the class of the device in question. For example, if Amazon Echo Dot is tested on the trained model, the classifier should be able to predict this device as belonging to device type Audio. How this works is by counting the prediction of the classifier based on the features for each device type. The device type with the highest count is predicted as the class for the device in question.

Dataset directory
The main dataset directory (CIC IoT Dataset) contains six subdirectories related to each experiment, namely:



Power:  In this directory, you will find the power experiment packet captures for each device, categorized by different device classes.



Idle:  In this directory, you will find idle experiment packet captures for 30 days, named and sorted by date.



Interactions:  In this directory, you will find the interactions experiments packet captures for each device, categorized by different device classes. Each interaction includes three packet captures.



Scenarios:  In this directory, you will find six sub-directories, each of which is related to one scenario. Each scenario includes three packet captures.



Active:  In this directory, you will find active experiment packet captures for 30 days, named and sorted by date.



Attacks:  In this directory, you will find two sub-directories, Flood and RTSP BruteForce, each for a specific attack performed on a few devices. The latter was performed using two different tools, Hydra and Nmap. Each attack includes three packet captures per device.

The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. There are 600 images per class. Each image comes with a ""fine"" label (the class to which it belongs) and a ""coarse"" label (the superclass to which it belongs). There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

The criteria for deciding whether an image belongs to a class were as follows:


The class name should be high on the list of likely answers to the question “What is in this picture?”
The image should be photo-realistic. Labelers were instructed to reject line drawings.
The image should contain only one prominent instance of the object to which the class refers.
The object may be partially occluded or seen from an unusual viewpoint as long as its identity is still clear to the labeler.",https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html,EditUnknown,"Audio, Graph, Image, Text",English,,Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf,600 images,training images and 100 testing images,100,"Variational Inference, class-incremental learning, Neural Architecture Search, Dataset Distillation - 1IPC, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, Bayesian Inference, Image Clustering, Classifier calibration, Small Data Image Classification, Image Classification with Label Noise, Data Free Quantization, Class Incremental Learning, Provable Adversarial Defense, Sparse Learning and binarization, Self-Supervised Learning, Transductive Zero-Shot Classification, Network Pruning, Image Classification, Adversarial Attack, Few-Shot Image Classification, Semi-Supervised Image Classification, Classification, Long-tail Learning, Novel Class Discovery, Out-of-Distribution Detection, Adversarial Defense, Binarization, Anomaly Detection, Personalized Federated Learning, Image Generation, Stochastic Optimization, Learning with coarse labels, Classification with Binary Weight Network, Zero-Shot Learning, Learning with noisy labels, Classification with Binary Neural Network, Non-exemplar-based Class Incremental Learning, Continual Learning, Knowledge Distillation, Adversarial Robustness, Incremental Learning, Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning, Conditional Image Generation","sparse-learning-and-binarization-on-cifar-100, conditional-image-generation-on-cifar-100, knowledge-distillation-on-cifar-100, class-incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-2, classification-with-binary-neural-network-on-2, long-tail-learning-on-cifar-100-lt-r-100, adversarial-robustness-on-cifar-100, incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-classes-3, anomaly-detection-on-unlabeled-cifar-10-vs, image-classification-with-label-noise-on-15, image-clustering-on-cifar-100, out-of-distribution-detection-on-cifar100, image-classification-on-cifar100, learning-with-noisy-labels-on-cifar-100, anomaly-detection-on-one-class-cifar-100, few-shot-image-classification-on-cifar100-5, dataset-distillation-1ipc-on-cifar-100, novel-class-discovery-on-cifar100, classifier-calibration-on-cifar-100, semi-supervised-image-classification-on-cifar-3, small-data-on-cifar-100-1000-labels-1, stochastic-optimization-on-cifar-100, class-incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-1, zero-shot-learning-on-cifar-100, classification-on-cifar-100, classification-on-cifar100, semi-supervised-image-classification-on-cifar-9, bayesian-inference-on-cifar100, continual-learning-on-cifar100-20-tasks, adversarial-attack-on-cifar-100, personalized-federated-learning-on-cifar-100, classification-with-binary-weight-network-on-2, variational-inference-on-cifar100, transductive-zero-shot-classification-on-8, incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-classes, learning-with-coarse-labels-on-cifar100, open-world-semi-supervised-learning-on-cifar-1, incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-classes-2, provable-adversarial-defense-on-cifar-100, semi-supervised-image-classification-on-cifar-8, binarization-on-cifar-100, semi-supervised-image-classification-on-cifar-2, adversarial-defense-on-cifar-100, image-generation-on-cifar-100, out-of-distribution-detection-on-cifar-100, class-incremental-learning-on-cifar100-1, class-incremental-learning-on-cifar100, data-free-quantization-on-cifar-100, few-shot-class-incremental-learning-on-cifar, neural-architecture-search-on-cifar-100-1, semi-supervised-image-classification-on-cifar-4, non-exemplar-based-class-incremental-learning, self-supervised-learning-on-cifar100, long-tail-learning-on-cifar-100-lt-r-10, incremental-learning-on-cifar-100-50-classes-1, self-supervised-learning-on-cifar-100, network-pruning-on-cifar-100, image-classification-on-cifar-100",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-100,Computer Vision,Variational Inference,Variational Inference

CIRR,CIRR Dataset,"Composed Image Retrieval (or, Image Retreival conditioned on Language Feedback) is a relatively new retrieval task, where an input query consists of an image and short textual description of how to modify the image. 

For humans, the advantage of a bi-modal query is clear: some concepts and attributes are more succinctly described visually, others through language. By cross-referencing the two modalities, a reference image can capture the general gist of a scene, while the text can specify finer details.

We identify a major challenge of this task as the inherent ambiguity in knowing what information is important (typically one object of interest in the scene) and what can be ignored (e.g., the background and other irrelevant objects).

Jigsaw sponsored this effort and extended annotation of this data by human raters for various toxic conversational attributes.

In the data supplied for this competition, the text of the individual comment is found in the comment_text column. Each comment in Train has a toxicity label (target), and models should predict the target toxicity for the Test data. This attribute (and all others) are fractional values which represent the fraction of human raters who believed the attribute applied to the given comment.

The data also has several additional toxicity subtype attributes. Models do not need to predict these attributes for the competition, they are included as an additional avenue for research. Subtype attributes are:


severe_toxicity
obscene
threat

We first manually construct the first class-level code generation benchmark ClassEval of 100 class-level Python code generation tasks with approximately 500 person-hours. Based on it, we then perform the first study of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. Based on our results, we have the following main findings. First, we find that all existing LLMs show much worse performance on class-level code generation compared to on standalone method-level code generation benchmarks like HumanEval; and the method-level coding ability cannot equivalently reflect the class-level coding ability among LLMs. Second, we find that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 still exhibit dominate superior than other LLMs on class-level code generation, and the second-tier models includes Instruct-Starcoder, Instruct-Codegen, and Wizardcoder with very similar performance. Third, we find that generating the entire class all at once (i.e. holistic generation strategy) is the best generation strategy only for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, while method-by-method generation (i.e. incremental and compositional) is better strategies for the other models with limited ability of understanding long instructions and utilizing the middle information.

CMMD,CMMD Dataset,"Breast carcinoma is the second largest cancer in the world among women. Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to increase the survival rate, thereby significantly increasing patients' lifespans. Mammography, a noninvasive imaging tool with low cost, is widely used to diagnose breast disease at an early stage due to its high sensitivity. The recent popularization of artificial intelligence in computer-aided diagnosis creates opportunities for advances in areas such as (1) Computer-aided detection for locating suspect lesions such as mass and microcalcification, leaving the classification to the radiologist; and (2) Computer-aided diagnosis for characterizing the suspicious region of lesion and/or estimate its probability of onset; and (3) Findings of predictive image-based biomarkers by applying the computational methods to mine the potential relationships between image representation and molecular subtype, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2 positive, and Triple-negative.

However, existing publicly available mammography databases are limited by small sample size, lack of diversity in patient populations, missing biopsy confirmations and unknown molecular sub-types.  To help fill the gap, we built a database conducted on 1,775 patients from China with benign or malignant breast disease who underwent mammography examination between July 2012 and January 2016. The database consists of 3,728 mammographies from these 1,775 patients, with biopsy confirmed type of benign or malignant tumors. For 749 of these patients (1,498 mammographies) we also include patients' molecular subtypes. Image data were acquired on a GE Senographe DS mammography system.

Coastal_Inundation_Maps_with_Floodwater_Depth_Valu,Coastal Inundation Maps with Floodwater Depth Values Dataset,"This dataset provides simulated flood inundation maps of Abu Dhabi's coast under 174 different shoreline protection scenarios. The maps were produced with a high-fidelity physics-based hydrodynamic simulator under a 0.5-meter sea level rise projection. The details of the hydrodynamic model are reported in [1].

The coastline was partitioned into 17 segments. The input protection scenarios were encoded as 17-dimensional binary vectors, with 1 indicating the placement of containments and 0 otherwise. The output inundation depth maps are named according to protection scenarios. Each map is a 1024x1024 matrix containing the estimated peak water level values (in meters) for selected 12066 locations along the coastline of Abu Dhabi. The mapping from gird indices to the original geographical coordinates of these locations is provided in a separate file (ad_grid_1024.npy). A Jupyter notebook with a sample Python code is included for visualizing the data entries (see Data_Visualization.ipynb).

CocoChorales,CocoChorales Dataset,"The CocoChorales Dataset
CocoChorales is a dataset consisting of over 1400 hours of audio mixtures containing four-part chorales performed by 13 instruments, all synthesized with realistic-sounding generative models. CocoChorales contains mixes, sources, and MIDI data, as well as annotations for note expression (e.g., per-note volume and vibrato) and synthesis parameters (e.g., multi-f0).

Dataset
We created CocoChorales using two generative models produced by Magenta: Coconet and MIDI-DDSP. The dataset was created in two stages. First, we used a trained Coconet model to generate a large set of four-part chorales in the style of J.S. Bach. The output of this first stage is a set of note sequences, stored as MIDI, to which we assign a tempo and add random timing variations to each note (for added realism).

In the second stage, we use MIDI-DDSP to synthesize these MIDI files into audio, resulting in audio clips that sound like the chorales were performed by live musicians. This MIDI-DDSP model was trained on URMP. We define a set of ensembles that consist of the following instruments, in Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass (SATB) order:

<ul>
  <li><strong>String Ensemble</strong>: Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello.</li>
  <li><strong>Brass Ensemble</strong>: Trumpet, French Horn, Trombone, Tuba.</li>
  <li><strong>Woodwind Ensemble</strong>: Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon.</li>
  <li><strong>Random Ensemble</strong>: Each SATB part is randomly assigned an instrument according to the following:
    <ul class=""nested"">
      <li><em>Soprano</em>: Violin, Flute, Trumpet, Clarinet, Oboe.</li>
      <li><em>Alto</em>: Violin, Viola, Flute, Clarinet, Oboe, Saxophone, Trumpet, French Horn.</li>
      <li><em>Tenor</em>: Viola, Cello, Clarinet, Saxophone, Trombone, French Horn.</li>
      <li><em>Bass</em>: Cello, Double Bass, Bassoon, Tuba.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


Each instrument in the ensemble is synthesized separately, with annotations for the high-level expressions used for each note (e.g., vibrato, note volume, note brightness, etc; all expressions shown here, and more details in Sections 3.2 and B.3 of the MIDI-DDSP paper) as well as detailed low-level annotations for synthesis parameters (e.g., f<sub>0</sub>’s, amplitudes of each harmonic, etc). Because the MIDI-DDSP model skews sharp, we randomly applied pitch augmentation to the f<sub>0</sub>’s (see Figure 2, here) to . All four audio clips for each instrument in the ensemble are then mixed together to produce an example in the dataset.

Because all of the data in CocoChorales originate from generative models, all of the annotations perfectly correspond to the audio data. All in all, the dataset contains 240,000 examples, 60,000 mixes from each one of the four ensemble types above. Each ensemble has its own train/validation/test split All of the audio is 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM data. Each example contains:

<ul>
  <li>A mixture</li>
  <li>Source audio for all four instruments
    <ul class=""nested"">
      <li>Gain applied to each source</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MIDI with tempo and precise timing</li>
  <li>The name of the ensemble with instrument names</li>
  <li>Note expression annotations for every note:
    <ul class=""nested"">
      <li>Volume, Volume Fluctuation, Volume Peak Position, Vibrato, Brightness, and Attack Noise used by MIDI-DDSP to synthesize every note (see Sections 3.2 and B.3 of the MIDI-DDSP paper for more details)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Synthesis parameters for every source (250 Hz):
    <ul class=""nested"">
      <li>Fundamental frequency (f<sub>0</sub>), amplitude, amplitude of all harmonics, filtered noise parameters</li>
      <li>Amount of pitch augmentation applied</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

This dataset provides causal questions that simulate common activities such as shopping, baking a cake, riding a bus, planting a tree, and going on a train ride. With approximately 9 million causal queries, the COLD dataset challenges LLMs to understand and reason about the causal relationships between events that are familiar and grounded in human experience.

Each query consists of a premise (an event) and a pair of choices representing possible causal effects. The goal of the model is to correctly identify which choice is the most plausible cause/effect of the given premise, testing the model's understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.

Key Features:
Activity Types: The dataset covers various everyday activities: shopping, cake baking, train ride, tree planting, and bus ride.
Causal Queries: Each query includes a premise and two possible causal events (choices). The model must decide which of the two choices is the more likely cause or effect.
Multiple-Choice Format: The queries can be formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQA), where the model must choose between two options.

The dataset provides a valuable test for causal reasoning in NLP models, focusing on realistic, daily-life scenarios.",https://huggingface.co/datasets/Exploration-Lab/COLD,EditUnknown,,,,,,,,,"Event Causality Identification, Commonsense Causal Reasoning",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cold-causal-reasoning-in-closed-daily,Methodology,Event Causality Identification,Event Causality Identification

The system detects the grammatical errors present in the input texts, and returns the corrected essays. The shared task in 2014 will require a participating system to correct all errors present in an essay (i.e., not restricted to just five error types in 2013). Also, the evaluation metric will be changed to F0.5, weighting precision twice as much as recall.

ContractNLI is the first dataset to utilize NLI for contracts and is also the largest corpus of annotated contracts (as of September 2021).

To generate this dataset, we place a camera sensor on the ego-vehicle in the Carla environment and set the parameters to those of the camera used to record the PIE dataset (i.e., 1920x1080, 110° FOV). Then, we compute bounding boxes for each pedestrian interacting with the ego vehicle as seen through the camera's field of view. We generated the data in two urban environments available in the CARLA simulator: Town02 and Town03.

The total number of simulated pedestrians is nearly 55k, equivalent to 14M bounding boxes samples. The critical point for each pedestrian is their first point of crossing the street (in case they will eventually cross) or the last bounding box coordinates of their path in the opposite case. The crossing behavior represents 25% of the total pedestrians. We balanced the training split of the dataset to obtain labeled sequences crossing/non-crossing in equal parts. We used sequence-flipping to augment the minority class (i.e., crossing behavior in our case) and then undersampled the rest of the dataset. The result is a total of nearly 50k pedestrian sequences.

Next, the pedestrian trajectory sequences were transformed into observation sequences of equal length (i.e., 0.5 seconds) with a 60% overlap for the training splits.

2.Continuing the intensive research on LFW with more realistic consideration on pose intra-class variation and fostering the research on cross-pose face verification in unconstrained situation. The challenge of CPLFW emphasizes pose difference to further enlarge intra-class variance. Also, negative pairs are deliberately selected to avoid different gender or race. CPLFW considers both the large intra-class variance and the tiny inter-class variance simultaneously.

CPSC2021,CPSC2021 Dataset,"Introduction
The 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021 (CPSC 2021) aims to encourage the development of algorithms for searching the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) events from dynamic ECG recordings.

ECG signal provides an important role in non-invasively monitoring and clinical diagnosis for cardiovascular disease (CVD). AF is the most frequent arrhythmia, but PAF often remains unrecognized[1, 2]. Early screening and early detection of paroxysmal AF are particularly important. It is of great value for AF surgery options, drug intervention, and the diagnosis and treatment of various clinical complications [3].

Although accurate detection of paroxysmal AF is very important, there is currently no algorithm that can efficiently measure the onsets and offsets of AF events in dynamic or wearable ECGs [4]. Previous AF detection algorithms usually focus on the classification of AF rhythm, such as entropy feature-based [5, 6] or machine learning-based methods [7, 8], without the location of onsets and offsets of AF events. Thus, the clinical significance for the personalized treatment and management of AF patients is limited. In clinical applications, other abnormal rhythms can significantly influence the accurate identification of AF rhythm. In this year’s challenge, we focus on the detection of paroxysmal AF events from dynamic ECGs. A new dynamic ECG database containing episodes with totally or partly AF rhythm, or non-AF rhythm was constructed, to encourage the development of the more efficient and robust algorithms for paroxysmal AF event detection.

Challenge Data
Data are recorded from 12-lead Holter or 3-lead wearable ECG monitoring devices. Challenge data provides variable-length ECG records fragments extracted from lead I and lead II of the long-term dynamic ECGs, each sampled at 200 Hz. In order to avoid ambiguity in annotation, an AF event is limited to contain no less than 5 heart beats.
The training set in the 1st stage consists of 730 records, extracted from the Holter records from 10 AF patients (5 PAF patients) and 39 non-AF patients (usually including other abnormal and normal rhythms).
The training set in the 2nd stage consists of 706 records from 37 AF patients (18 PAF patients) and 14 non-AF patients.
The test set comprises data from the same source as the training set as well as different data source. We ensure that at least one test subset was collected by a different ECG monitoring system compared with the training set. Same as in previous years, we are not planning to release the test set at any point.
All data is provided in WFDB format and the annotations are standardized according to PhysioBank Annotations (link: https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/annotations.shtml). The annotation includes the beat annotations (R peak location and beat type), the rhythm annotations (rhythm change flag and rhythm type) and the diagnosis of the global rhythm. Please refer to the example code entry (link: https://github.com/CPSC-Committee/cpsc2021-python-entry ) of the challenge for specific data and label load functions. Note that the flag of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (‘AFIB’ and ‘AFL’) in annotated information are seemed as the same type when scoring the method.

Five different authors performed the task for 20 different Flickr and Search-and-Rescue image-sets ( a sequence of 3 images) for a total of 100 items in the anthology. There are 300 unique Entity and Scene entries (single-image facets completed for each image), 200 unique Narrative entries (multi-image facets performed twice with two and then three images), and 100 unique Title entries (multi-image facets completed for three images). Thus, with each one assigned a title, there are 100 unique stories in the anthology all together.

We do not release the Flickr images in order to track the providence of the images. The Flickr images' authors and copyright information and usage are documented in the Flickr imageset license spreadsheet.

The second source of images came from a Search and Rescue (SAR) scenario.

Actors spoke from a selection of 12 sentences. The sentences were presented using one of six different emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, and Sad) and four different emotion levels (Low, Medium, High, and Unspecified).

Participants rated the emotion and emotion levels based on the combined audiovisual presentation, the video alone, and the audio alone. Due to the large number of ratings needed, this effort was crowd-sourced and a total of 2443 participants each rated 90 unique clips, 30 audio, 30 visual, and 30 audio-visual. 95% of the clips have more than 7 ratings.",https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D,EditUnknown,"Audio, Image, Text, Video",English,,,,12 sentences,,,"Audio Classification, Self-Supervised Learning, Talking Face Generation, Speech Emotion Recognition, Video Emotion Recognition, Few-Shot Audio Classification, Facial Expression Recognition (FER)","self-supervised-learning-on-crema-d, video-emotion-recognition-on-crema-d, facial-expression-recognition-on-crema-d, speech-emotion-recognition-on-crema-d, audio-classification-on-crema-d, talking-face-generation-on-crema-d, few-shot-audio-classification-on-crema-d",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/crema-d,Audio,Audio Classification,Audio Classification
CREMI,CREMI Dataset,"MICCAI Challenge on Circuit Reconstruction from Electron Microscopy Images.

About
The goal of this challenge is to evaluate algorithms for automatic reconstruction of neurons and neuronal connectivity from serial section electron microscopy data. The comparison is performed not only by evaluating the quality of neuron segmentations, but also by assessing the accuracy of detecting synapses and identifying synaptic partners. The challenge is carried out on three large and diverse datasets from adult Drosophila melanogaster brain tissue, comprising neuron segmentation ground truth and annotations for synaptic connections. A successful solution would demonstrate its efficiency and generalizability, and carry great potential to reduce the time spent on manual reconstruction of neural circuits in electron microscopy volumes.

Description
We provide three datasets, each consisting of two (5 μm)3 volumes (training and testing, each 1250 px × 1250 px × 125 px) of serial section EM of the adult fly brain. Each volume has neuron and synapse labelings and annotations for pre- and post-synaptic partners.",https://cremi.org/,EditUnknown,"3D, Image",,,,,,,,"3D Instance Segmentation, Brain Image Segmentation",brain-image-segmentation-on-cremi,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cremi,Computer Vision,3D Instance Segmentation,3D Instance Segmentation

CriticBench,CriticBench Dataset,"CriticBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and rectify their reasoning across various tasks. It encompasses five reasoning domains:


Mathematical
Commonsense
Symbolic
Coding
Algorithmic

CriticBench compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. By utilizing CriticBench, researchers evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning (referred to as GQC reasoning). Notable findings include:


A linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training significantly enhancing performance.
Task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction.
GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases.
An intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models excel at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models surprisingly surpass stronger ones in self-critique.

DDXPlus,DDXPlus Dataset,"There has been a rapidly growing interest in Automatic Symptom Detection (ASD) and Automatic Diagnosis (AD) systems in the machine learning research literature, aiming to assist doctors in telemedicine services. These systems are designed to interact with patients, collect evidence about their symptoms and relevant antecedents, and possibly make predictions about the underlying diseases. Doctors would review the interactions, including the evidence and the predictions, collect if necessary additional information from patients, before deciding on next steps. Despite recent progress in this area, an important piece of doctors' interactions with patients is missing in the design of these systems, namely the differential diagnosis. Its absence is largely due to the lack of datasets that include such information for models to train on. In this work, we present a large-scale synthetic dataset of roughly 1.3 million patients that includes a differential diagnosis, along with the ground truth pathology, symptoms and antecedents for each patient. Unlike existing datasets which only contain binary symptoms and antecedents, this dataset also contains categorical and multi-choice symptoms and antecedents useful for efficient data collection. Moreover, some symptoms are organized in a hierarchy, making it possible to design systems able to interact with patients in a logical way. As a proof-of-concept, we extend two existing AD and ASD systems to incorporate the differential diagnosis, and provide empirical evidence that using differentials as training signals is essential for the efficiency of such systems or for helping doctors better understand the reasoning of those systems.",https://github.com/bruzwen/ddxplus,EditUnknown,,,,,,,,,Medical Diagnosis,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ddxplus,Medical,Medical Diagnosis,Medical Diagnosis

DEEP-VOICE__DeepFake_Voice_Recognition,DEEP-VOICE: DeepFake Voice Recognition Dataset,"DEEP-VOICE: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion
This dataset contains examples of real human speech, and DeepFake versions of those speeches by using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion. 

Can machine learning be used to detect when speech is AI-generated?

Introduction
There are growing implications surrounding generative AI in the speech domain that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to another. This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. 

To address the above emerging issues, we are introducing the DEEP-VOICE dataset. DEEP-VOICE is comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.

For each speech, the accompaniment (""background noise"") was removed before conversion using RVC. The original accompaniment is then added back to the DeepFake speech:



(Above: Overview of the Retrieval-based Voice Conversion process to generate DeepFake speech with Ryan Gosling's speech converted to Margot Robbie. Conversion is run on the extracted vocals before being layered on the original background ambience.)

Dataset
There are two forms to the dataset that are made available. 

First, the raw audio can be found in the ""AUDIO"" directory. They are arranged within ""REAL"" and ""FAKE"" class directories. The audio filenames note which speakers provided the real speech, and which voices they were converted to. For example ""Obama-to-Biden"" denotes that Barack Obama's speech has been converted to Joe Biden's voice. 

Second, the extracted features can be found in the ""DATASET-balanced.csv"" file. This is the data that was used in the below study. The dataset has each feature extracted from one-second windows of audio and are balanced through random sampling.

Note:  All experimental data is found within the ""KAGGLE"" directory. The ""DEMONSTRATION"" directory is used for playing cropped and compressed demos in notebooks due to Kaggle's limitations on file size.

A potential use of a successful system could be used for the following: 



(Above: Usage of the real-time system. The end user is notified when the machine learning model has processed the speech audio (e.g. a phone or conference call) and predicted that audio chunks contain AI-generated speech.)

The driven route with cities along the road is shown on the right. In total, 100k Objekts were labeled with accurate 2D and 3D bounding boxes. The main contributions of this dataset are:
- We provide a proving ground for a broad range of algorithms covering signal enhancement, domain adaptation, object detection, or multi-modal sensor fusion, focusing on the learning of robust redundancies between sensors, especially if they fail asymmetrically in different weather conditions.
- The dataset was created with the initial intention to showcase methods, which learn of robust redundancies between the sensor and enable a raw data sensor fusion in case of asymmetric sensor failure induced through adverse weather effects.
- In our case we departed from proposal level fusion and applied an adaptive fusion driven by measurement entropy enabling the detection also in case of unknown adverse weather effects. This method outperforms other reference fusion methods, which even drop in below single image methods.

This work is accepted by ACL findings 2021. You may find the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06762.pdf.

If you want to use our dataset, please cite our paper. 

Dialogue Data
We collect dialogue data for DialogSum from three public dialogue corpora, namely Dailydialog (Li et al., 2017), DREAM (Sun et al., 2019) and MuTual (Cui et al., 2019), as well as an English speaking practice website. 
These datasets contain face-to-face spoken dialogues that cover a wide range of daily-life topics, including schooling, work, medication, shopping, leisure, travel.
Most conversations take place between friends, colleagues, and between service providers and customers.

Compared with previous datasets, dialogues from DialogSum have distinct characteristics: 
* Under rich real-life scenarios, including more diverse task-oriented scenarios;
* Have clear communication patterns and intents, which is valuable to serve as summarization sources;
* Have a reasonable length, which comforts the purpose of automatic summarization.

Summaries
We ask annotators to summarize each dialogue based on the following criteria:
* Convey the most salient information;
* Be brief;
* Preserve important named entities within the conversation;
* Be written from an observer perspective;
* Be written in formal language.

Topics
In addition to summaries, we also ask annotators to write a short topic for each dialogue, which can be potentially useful for future work, e.g. generating summaries by leveraging topic information.",https://github.com/cylnlp/DialogSum,EditMIT,Text,English,2021,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06762.pdf,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06762.pdf,,,,"Abstractive Text Summarization, Text Summarization, Dialogue Generation",text-summarization-on-dialogsum,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/dialogsum,Natural Language Processing,Abstractive Text Summarization,Abstractive Text Summarization
Dialogue_State_Tracking_Challenge,Dialogue State Tracking Challenge Dataset,"The Dialog State Tracking Challenges 2 & 3 (DSTC2&3) were research challenge focused on improving the state of the art in tracking the state of spoken dialog systems. State tracking, sometimes called belief tracking, refers to accurately estimating the user's goal as a dialog progresses. Accurate state tracking is desirable because it provides robustness to errors in speech recognition, and helps reduce ambiguity inherent in language within a temporal process like dialog.
In these challenges, participants were given labelled corpora of dialogs to develop state tracking algorithms. The trackers were then evaluated on a common set of held-out dialogs, which were released, un-labelled, during a one week period.

The corpus was collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and consists of dialogs in two domains: restaurant information, and tourist information. Tourist information subsumes restaurant information, and includes bars, cafés etc. as well as multiple new slots. There were two rounds of evaluation using this data:

DSTC 2 released a large number of training dialogs related to restaurant search. Compared to DSTC (which was in the bus timetables domain), DSTC 2 introduces changing user goals, tracking 'requested slots' as well as the new restaurants domain. Results from DSTC 2 were presented at SIGDIAL 2014.
DSTC 3 addressed the problem of adaption to a new domain - tourist information. DSTC 3 releases a small amount of labelled data in the tourist information domain; participants will use this data plus the restaurant data from DSTC 2 for training.
Dialogs used for training are fully labelled; user transcriptions, user dialog-act semantics and dialog state are all annotated. (This corpus therefore is also suitable for studies in Spoken Language Understanding.)",https://github.com/matthen/dstc,EditUnknown,"Image, Text, Video",English,2014,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-4065.pdf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-4065.pdf,,,,"Dialogue State Tracking, Intent Detection, Spoken Language Understanding, Slot Filling, domain classification, Deblurring, Spoken Dialogue Systems","deblurring-on-second-dialogue-state-tracking, domain-classification-on-dialogue-state, intent-detection-on-dialogue-state-tracking, dialogue-state-tracking-on-second-dialogue, slot-filling-on-dialogue-state-tracking",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/dialogue-state-tracking-challenge,Computer Vision,Dialogue State Tracking,Dialogue State Tracking

The news articles are written in Italian and describe 11 types of crime events occurred in the province of Modena between the end of 2011 and 2021.

Moreover, the dataset includes data derived from the abovementioned components thanks to the application of Natural Language Processing techniques. 
Some examples are the place of the crime event occurrence (municipality, area, address and GPS coordinates), the date of the occurrence, and the type of the crime events described in the news article obtained by an automatic categorization of the text.

In the end, news articles describing the same crime events (duplciates) are detected by calculating the document  similarity.

Now, we are working on the application of question answering to extract the 5W+1H and we plan to extend the current dataset with the obtained data.

1. Signet ring cell dataset
Signet ring cell carcinoma is a type of rare adenocarcinoma with poor prognosis. Early detection of such cells leads to huge improvement of patients' survival rate. However, there is no existing public dataset with annotations for studying the problem of signet ring cell detection.

This dataset has positive samples and negative samples. Training positive samples contain 77 images from 20 WSIs, with cell bounding boxes written in xml. Training negative samples contain 378 images from 79 WSIs.These negative WSIs have no signet ring, but could contain other kinds of tumor cells. Each signet ring cell is labeled by experienced pathologists with a rectangle bounding box tightly surrounding the cell. Each image is of size 2000X2000. The training images are from 2 organs, including gastric mucosa and intestine. Because of the difficulty of manual annotation, there exist some signet ring cells who are missed by pathologists. In other words, this dataset is  a noisy dataset with its positive images not fully annotated. 

All whole slide images were stained by hematoxylin and eosin and scanned at X40. 

2. Colonoscopy tissue segment dataset
Colonoscopy pathology examination can find cells of early-stage colon tumor from small tissue slices. Pathologists need to daily examine hundreds of tissue slices, which is a time consuming and exhausting work. Here we propose a challenge task on automatic colonoscopy tissue segmentation and screening, aiming at automatic lesion segmentation and classification of the whole tissue (benign vs. malignant).

This dataset has positive samples and negative samples. Training positive samples contain 250 images of tissue from 93 WSIs, with pixel-level annotation in jpg format, where 0 means background and 255 for foreground (malignant lesion). You could simply get binary mask by a threshold 128. Training negative samples contain 410 images of tissue from 231 WSI. This negative images have no annotation because they don't have any malignant lesion.

The average size of all images are of 5000x5000 pixels, some of them are extremely huge. We will also provide another 152 patients' 212 tissues as the testing set, in which 90 images from 65 patients contain lesion. All whole slide images were stained by hematoxylin and eosin and scanned at X20.

Because different corpora, languages and frameworks use different guidelines for segmentation, the shared task is meant to promote design of flexible methods for dealing with various guidelines, and help to push forward the discussion of standards for discourse units.

DOLPHINS outperforms current datasets in six dimensions: temporally-aligned images and point clouds from both vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) enabling both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based collaborative perception; 6 typical scenarios with dynamic weather conditions make the most various interconnected autonomous driving dataset; meticulously selected viewpoints providing full coverage of the key areas and every object; 42376 frames and 292549 objects, as well as the corresponding 3D annotations, geo-positions, and calibrations, compose the largest dataset for collaborative perception; Full-HD images and 64-line LiDARs construct high-resolution data with sufficient details; well-organized APIs and open-source codes ensure the extensibility of DOLPHINS. We also construct a benchmark of 2D detection, 3D detection, and multi-view collaborative perception tasks on DOLPHINS.

DRIFT,DRIFT Dataset,"The DRIFT dataset includes 25k image patches collected in five European countries sourced from aerial and nanosatellite image archives. Each image patch is associated with three target variables to predict: 


Canopy height: average height value for pixels containing woody vegetation. 
Tree count: number of overstory (visible from an overhead perspective) trees in the images. 
Tree cover fraction: percentage of the image being covered by overstory tree crowns.

The DRIFT dataset includes significant shifts between label and visual distributions due to sensor and area differences. Furthermore, vegetation tends to grow to fit the local climate, therefore introducing concept drift in the data: same tree species may appear differently in different subsets. The label distribution also varies among different subsets (countries).

The dataset is a good choice for:

DrugBank,DrugBank Dataset,"Abstract:
First released in 2006, DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com) has grown to become the 'gold standard' knowledge resource for drug, drug-target and related pharmaceutical information. DrugBank is widely used across many diverse biomedical research and clinical applications, and averages more than 30 million views/year. Since its last update in 2018, we have been actively enhancing the quantity and quality of the drug data in this knowledgebase. In this latest release (DrugBank 6.0), the number of FDA approved drugs has grown from 2646 to 4563 (a 72% increase), the number of investigational drugs has grown from 3394 to 6231 (a 38% increase), the number of drug-drug interactions increased from 365 984 to 1 413 413 (a 300% increase), and the number of drug-food interactions expanded from 1195 to 2475 (a 200% increase). In addition to this notable expansion in database size, we have added thousands of new, colorful, richly annotated pathways depicting drug mechanisms and drug metabolism. Likewise, existing datasets have been significantly improved and expanded, by adding more information on drug indications, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions and many other relevant data types for 11 891 drugs. We have also added experimental and predicted MS/MS spectra, 1D/2D-NMR spectra, CCS (collision cross section), RT (retention time) and RI (retention index) data for 9464 of DrugBank's 11 710 small molecule drugs. These and other improvements should make DrugBank 6.0 even more useful to a much wider research audience ranging from medicinal chemists to metabolomics specialists to pharmacologists.

Drunkard_s_Dataset,Drunkard's Dataset Dataset,"Estimating camera motion in deformable scenes poses a complex and open research challenge. Most existing non-rigid structure from motion techniques assume to observe also static scene parts besides deforming scene parts in order to establish an anchoring reference. However, this assumption does not hold true in certain relevant application cases such as endoscopies. To tackle this issue with a common benchmark, we introduce the Drunkard’s Dataset, a challenging collection of synthetic data targeting visual navigation and reconstruction in deformable environments. This dataset is the first large set of exploratory camera trajectories with ground truth inside 3D scenes where every surface exhibits non-rigid deformations over time. Simulations in realistic 3D buildings lets us obtain a vast amount of data and ground truth labels, including camera poses, RGB images and depth, optical flow and normal maps at high resolution and quality.",https://davidrecasens.github.io/TheDrunkard'sOdometry/,EditMIT License,"3D, Image, Time Series, Video",,,,,,,,"3D Pose Estimation, Pose Estimation, Visual Tracking, Real-Time Visual Tracking, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, Pose Tracking, Pose Prediction, 6D Pose Estimation using RGBD, Drone Pose Estimation, 6D Pose Estimation, Single-View 3D Reconstruction, 3D Reconstruction, Visual Odometry, Monocular Visual Odometry, 6D Pose Estimation using RGB",6d-pose-estimation-using-rgbd-on-drunkard-s,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/drunkard-s-dataset,Computer Vision,3D Pose Estimation,3D Pose Estimation

There is limited availability of large, annotated public databases for the training and testing of algorithms for lung nodule classification.

Methods: Screening chest CT scans done between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2021 at Duke University Health System were considered for this study. Efficient nodule annotation was performed semi-automatically by using a publicly available deep learning nodule detection algorithm trained on the LUNA16 dataset to identify initial candidates, which were then accepted based on nodule location in the radiology text report or manually annotated by a medical student and a fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologist.

Results: The dataset contains 1613 CT volumes with 2487 annotated nodules. Radiologist spot-checking confirmed the semi-automated annotation had an accuracy rate of >90%.

Conclusions: The Duke Lung Nodule Dataset is the first large dataset for CT screening for lung cancer reflecting the use of current CT technology.

Earth_on_Canvas,Earth on Canvas Dataset,"A Zero-Shot Sketch-based Inter-Modal Object Retrieval Scheme for Remote Sensing Images

WITH the advancement in sensor technology, huge amounts of data are being collected from various satellites. Hence, the task of target-based data retrieval and acquisition has become exceedingly challenging. Existing satellites essentially scan a vast overlapping region of the Earth using various sensing techniques, like multi-spectral, hyperspectral, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), video, and compressed sensing, to name a few. With increasing complexity and different sensing techniques at our disposal, it has become our primary interest to design efficient algorithms to retrieve data from multiple data modalities, given the complementary information that is captured by different sensors. This type of problem is referred to as inter-modal data retrieval. In remote sensing (RS), there are primarily two important types of problems, i.e., land-cover classification and object detection. In this work, we focus on the target-based object retrieval part, which falls under the realm of object detection in RS. Object retrieval essentially requires high-resolution imagery for objects to be distinctly visible in the image. The main challenge with the conventional retrieval approach using large-scale databases is that, quite often, we do not have any query image sample of the target class at our disposal. The target of interest solely exists as a perception to the user in the form of an imprecise sketch. In such situations where a photo query is absent, it can be immensely useful if we can promptly make a quick hand-made sketch of the target. Sketches are a highly symbolic and hieroglyphic representation of data. One can exploit the notion of this minimalistic representative of sketch queries for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) framework. While dealing with satellite images, it is imperative to collect as many samples of images as possible for each object class for object recognition with a high success rate. However, in general, there exists a considerable number of classes for which we seldom have any training data samples. Therefore, for such classes, we can use the zero-shot learning (ZSL) strategy. The ZSL approach aims to solve a task without receiving any example of that task during the training phase. This makes the network capable of handling an unseen class (new class) sample obtained during the inference phase upon deployment of the network. Hence, we propose the aerial sketch-image dataset, namely Earth on Canvas dataset.

EC-FUNSD,EC-FUNSD Dataset,"EC-FUNSD is introduced in  [arXiv:2402.02379] as a benchmark of semantic entity recognition (SER) and entity linking (EL), designed for the entity-centric robustness evaluation of pre-trained text-and-layout models (PTLMs).

In practical applications of document intelligence, PTLMs (e.g. the LayoutLM series) generally serve as the encoder of document layouts, similar to the role played by pre-trained contextualized language models (e.g. the BERT series) in NLP tasks.
Conventionally, information extraction (IE) ability of PTLMs is evaluated via SER and EL, esp. in a sequence-labeling manner. 
The performance of PTLMs on these tasks reflects the capacity of their layout embeddings to facilitate downstream IE tasks.
However, the prevailing benchmarks do not fully conform to the aforementioned evaluation pipeline, thereby diminishing the reliability of the assessment. Take FUNSD as an example, its block-level annotation falsely couples the annotations of segment and entity, which does not adequately represent semantic-driven entities and hinder the fair evaluation. 

The propose of EC-FUNSD aims to provide a fair and unbiased evaluation benchmark of IE ability of PTLMs. 
The construction of this dataset includes the revision of layout and IE annotations from FUNSD. 
First, the original layout annotation of FUNSD is cleaned, and multiple-row blocks are split into row-wise segments.
Second, the semantic entities are re-annotated together with their linking relationships, with the segment order preserved to ensure that each entity is represented as a continuous word span within layout, making the form of this dataset suitable for sequence-labeling models. 
The final dataset consists of 199 document samples including the image, layout annotation of segments and words, and labeled entities of 3 categories. 
For the detailed annotation process and statistics, please refer to the original paper.",https://github.com/chongzhangFDU/ROOR-Datasets,EditCC-BY-4.0,,,,[arXiv:2402.02379],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02379,,,3,"Semantic entity labeling, Entity Linking","semantic-entity-labeling-on-ec-funsd, entity-linking-on-ec-funsd",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ec-funsd,Methodology,Semantic entity labeling,Semantic entity labeling
ECB_,ECB+ Dataset,"The ECB+ corpus is an extension to the EventCorefBank (ECB, Bejan and Harabagiu, 2010). A newly added corpus component consists of 502 documents that belong to the 43 topics of the ECB but that describe different seminal events than those already captured in the ECB. All corpus texts were found through Google Search and were annotated with mentions of events and their times, locations, human and non-human participants as well as with within- and cross-document event and entity coreference information. The 2012 version of annotation of the ECB corpus (Lee et al., 2012) was used as a starting point for re-annotation of the ECB according to the ECB+ annotation guideline.

The major differences with respect to the 2012 version of annotation of the ECB are:

(a) five event components are annotated in text:

actions (annotation tags starting with ACTION and NEG)
times (annotation tags starting with TIME)
locations (annotation tags starting with LOC)
human participants (annotation tags starting with HUMAN)
non-human participants (annotation tags starting with NON_HUMAN)

(b) specific action classes and entity subtypes are distinguished for each of the five main event components resulting in a total tagset of 30 annotation tags based on ACE annotation guidelines (LDC 2008), TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003 and Sauri et al., 2005)
(c) intra- and cross-document coreference relations between mentions of the five event components were established:

INTRA_DOC_COREF tag captures within document coreference chains that do not participate in cross-document relations; within document coreference was annotated by means of the CAT tool (Bartalesi et al., 2012)
CROSS_DOC_COREF tag indicates cross-document coreference relations created in the CROMER tool (Girardi et al., 2014); all coreference branches refer by means of relation target IDs to the so called TAG_DESCRIPTORS, pointing to human friendly instance names (assigned by coders) and also to instance_id-s

(d) events are annotated from an “event-centric” perspective, i.e. annotation tags are assigned depending on the role a mention plays in an event (for more information see ECB+ references).",http://www.newsreader-project.eu/results/data/the-ecb-corpus/,EditCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licens,Text,English,2010,,,502 documents,,,"Coreference Resolution, Event Cross-Document Coreference Resolution, Entity Cross-Document Coreference Resolution, Event Coreference Resolution","entity-cross-document-coreference-resolution, event-cross-document-coreference-resolution",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ecb,Natural Language Processing,Coreference Resolution,Coreference Resolution

Usage
The dataset can be used for uni- and multivariate analysis. 

To read a uni-variate time series with pandas do:

```python
import pandas as pd

Example of loading ams-feg/co2-1.csv
data = pd.read_csv('./ams-feg/co2-1.csv')
print(data.head())

```

To read the data for a whole subsystem (e.g. AMS-FEG) as a multivariate time series:
```python
import pandas as pd
import glob

SUBSYSTEM = 'ams-feg'

combined_df = pd.DataFrame()
for i, file in enumerate(glob.glob(f'./{SUBSYSTEM}/*.csv')):
    df = pd.read_csv(file, header=0, usecols=[0, 1])
    if i == 0:
        combined_df = df
    else:
        combined_df = pd.merge(combined_df, df, on='time')

combined_df = combined_df.sort_values(by='time').reset_index(drop=True)

print(combined_df)

EDGE-IIOTSET,EDGE-IIOTSET Dataset,"ABSTRACT 
In this project, we propose a new comprehensive realistic cyber security dataset of IoT and IIoT applications, called Edge-IIoTset, which can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in two different modes, namely, centralized and federated learning. Specifically, the proposed testbed is organized into seven layers, including, Cloud Computing Layer, Network Functions Virtualization Layer, Blockchain Network Layer, Fog Computing Layer, Software-Defined Networking Layer, Edge Computing Layer, and IoT and IIoT Perception Layer. In each layer, we propose new emerging technologies that satisfy the key requirements of IoT and IIoT applications, such as, ThingsBoard IoT platform, OPNFV platform, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Digital twin, ONOS SDN controller, Mosquitto MQTT brokers, Modbus TCP/IP, ...etc. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, ...etc.). However, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes.

The approach to collection is designed to uphold rigorous privacy and ethics standards with consenting participants and robust de-identification procedures where relevant. Ego4D dramatically expands the volume of diverse egocentric video footage publicly available to the research community. Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event. Furthermore, a host of new benchmark challenges are presented, centered around understanding the first-person visual experience in the past (querying an episodic memory), present (analyzing hand-object manipulation, audio-visual conversation, and social interactions), and future (forecasting activities). By publicly sharing this massive annotated dataset and benchmark suite, the aim is to push the frontier of first-person perception.

EgoExoLearn,EgoExoLearn Dataset,"EgoExoLearn is a fascinating dataset designed to bridge the gap between egocentric and exocentric views of procedural activities. 



What Is EgoExoLearn?   EgoExoLearn is a large-scale dataset that emulates how humans learn by observing others. It focuses on the process of asynchronous demonstration following. Participants in the dataset record egocentric videos as they perform tasks. These videos are guided by exocentric-view demonstration videos. In simpler terms, imagine someone watching a demonstration video (from an external perspective) and then replicating the same task while recording their own point-of-view video.



Dataset Details:
EgoExoLearn dataset spans 120 hours and covers scenarios from daily life and specialized laboratories. It contains:


Egocentric videos: These are recorded by individuals executing tasks.
Demonstration videos: These show the same tasks from an external viewpoint.
Gaze data: High-quality gaze information accompanies the videos.
Multimodal annotations: Detailed annotations provide context and insights.



Applications and Benchmarks:
The EgoExoLearn dataset serves as a playground for modeling the human ability and thus provides a playground to bridge asynchronous procedural actions from different viewpoints.
It enables new benchmarks such as:


Cross-view association: Linking actions observed from different perspectives.
Cross-view action planning: Anticipating and planning actions based on both ego and exo views.
Cross-view referenced skill assessment: Evaluating skills across viewpoints. Using Exo-view demonstrations as guidance for better ego-view skill assessment.



Why Is It Important?


Understanding how we map others' activities into our own point of view is a fundamental human skill.
EgoExoLearn paves the way for creating AI agents capable of seamlessly learning by observing humans in the real world.

EigenWorms,EigenWorms Dataset,"Caenorhabditis elegans is a roundworm commonly used as a model organism in the study of genetics. The movement of these worms is known to be a useful indicator for understanding behavioural genetics. Brown {\em et al.}[1] describe a system for recording the motion of worms on an agar plate and measuring a range of human-defined features[2]. It has been shown that the space of shapes Caenorhabditis elegans adopts on an agar plate can be represented by combinations of six base shapes, or eigenworms. Once the worm outline is extracted, each frame of worm motion can be captured by six scalars representing the amplitudes along each dimension when the shape is projected onto the six eigenworms. Using data collected for the work described in[1], we address the problem of classifying individual worms as wild-type or mutant based on the time series. The data were extracted from the C. elegans behavioural database [3]. We have 259 cases, which we split 131 train and 128 test. We have truncated each series to the shortest usable. Each series has 17984 observations. Each worm is classified as either wild-type (the N2 reference strain) or one of four mutant types: goa-1; unc-1; unc-38 and unc-63. [1] A. Brown, E. Yemini, L.

Data Set Information:
This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).
Notes:


(global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3.
The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1,25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.

Attribute Information:

date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
time: time in format hh:mm:ss
global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

ENRICH,ENRICH Dataset,"A new synthetic, multi-purpose dataset - called ENRICH - for testing photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms. Compared to existing datasets, ENRICH offers higher resolution images also rendered with different lighting conditions, camera orientation, scales, and field of view. Specifically, ENRICH is composed of three sub-datasets: ENRICH-Aerial, ENRICH-Square, and ENRICH-Statue, each exhibiting different characteristics. The proposed dataset is useful for several photogrammetry and computer vision-related tasks, such as the evaluation of hand-crafted and deep learning-based local features, effects of ground control points (GCPs) configuration on the 3D accuracy, and monocular depth estimation.

Each zip file in the root is relative to a specific dataset:


ENRICH-Aerial, is an aerial image block of the city of Launceston, Australia. The acquisition is performed by simulating a typical oblique aerial camera with five views (nadir and four oblique views).
ENRICH-Square, is a ground-level dataset of a square captured by four cameras, each one moving on a different path with different focal length, orientation, and lighting conditions.
ENRICH-Statue, is a ground-level dataset portraying a statue (placed in the center of the ENRICH-Square scene), acquired using four cameras moving on different paths with different focal lengths, orientations, and lighting conditions.

Epilepsy_seizure_prediction,Epilepsy seizure prediction Dataset,"The original dataset from the reference consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person. Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points. Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds.

We divided and shuffled every 4097 data points into 23 chunks, each chunk contains 178 data points for 1 second, and each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So now we have 23 x 500 = 11500 pieces of information(row), each information contains 178 data points for 1 second(column), the last column represents the label y {1,2,3,4,5}.

The response variable is y in column 179, the Explanatory variables X1, X2, ..., X178

y contains the category of the 178-dimensional input vector. Specifically y in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

Ethics__per_ethics_,Ethics (per ethics) Dataset,"Ethics (per ethics) dataset is created to test the knowledge of the basic concepts of morality. The task is to predict human ethical judgments about diverse text situations in a multi-label classification setting. The main objective of the task is to evaluate the positive or negative implementation of five concepts in normative with ‘yes’ and ‘no’ ratings. The included concepts are as follows: virtue, law, moral, justice, and utilitarianism.

Motivation

There are a multitude of approaches to evaluating ethics in machine learning. The Ethics dataset for Russian is created from scratch for the first time, relying on the design compatible with (Hendrycks et al., 2021).

Our Ethics dataset would go through community validation and discussion as it is the first ethics dataset for Russian based on the established methodology. We acknowledge that the work (Hendrycks et al., 2021) has flaws; thus, we do not reproduce the generative approach. We construct the dataset using a similar annotation scheme: we avoid the direct question of whether the deed is good or bad. Instead, we make annotations according to five criteria that describe the aspects of the annotators' attitude to the deed.

An example in English for illustration purposes:

Each training episode in the dataset corresponds to seven test variations, including the original test data and six adversarial test sets, acquired through the modification of the original test through the following text perturbations:


ButterFingers: randomly adds noise to data by mimicking spelling mistakes made by humans through character swaps based on their keyboard distance
Emojify: replaces the input words with the corresponding emojis, preserving their original meaning
EDAdelete: randomly deletes tokens in the text
EDAswap: randomly swaps tokens in the text

Introduction:
EUCA dataset is for modelling personalized or interactive explainable AI. It contains 309 data points of 32 end-users' preferences on 12 forms of explanation (including feature-, example-, and rule-based explanations). The data were collected from a user study on 32 layperson participants in the Greater Vancouver city area in 2019-2020. In the user study, the participants (P01-P32) were presented with AI-assisted critical tasks on house price prediction, health status prediction, purchasing a self-driving car, and studying for a biological exam 1. Within each task and for its given explanation goal 2, the participants selected and rank the explanatory forms 3 that they saw the most suitable.

More Context for EUCA Dataset
1 Critical tasks
There are four tasks. Task label and their corresponding task titles are:
house - Selling your house 
car - Buying an autonomous driving vehicle
health - Personal health decision
bird - Learning bird species

Please refer to EUCA quantatative data analysis report for the storyboard of the tasks and explanation goals presented in the user study.

2  Explanation goal
End-users may have different goals/purposes to check an explanation from AI. The EUCA dataset includes the following 11 explanation goals, with its [label] in the dataset, full name and description


[trust] Calibrate trust: trust is a key to
   establish human-AI decision-making partnership. Since users can
   easily distrust or overtrust AI, it is important to calibrate the
   trust to reflect the capabilities of AI systems.

[safe] Ensure safety: users need to ensure
   safety of the decision consequences.



[bias] - Detect bias: users need to ensure the
   decision is impartial and unbiased.



[unexpect] Resolve disagreement with AI: the AI
   prediction is unexpected and there are
   disagreements between users and AI. 



[expected] - Expected: the AI's prediction is
    expected and aligns with users'
    expectations.



[differentiate] Differentiate similar instances: due to
   the consequences of wrong decisions, users sometimes need to discern
   similar instances or outcomes. For example, a doctor differentiates
   whether the diagnosis is a benign or malignant tumor.



[learning] Learn: users need to gain knowledge,
   improve their problem-solving skills, and discover new knowledge



[control] Improve: users seek causal factors to
   control and improve the predicted outcome.



[communicate] Communicate with stakeholders: many
   critical decision-making processes involve multiple stakeholders,
   and users need to discuss the decision with them.



[report] Generate reports: users need to utilize
    the explanations to perform particular tasks such as report
    production. For example, a radiologist generates a medical report on
    a patient's X-ray image.



[multi] Trade-off multiple objectives: AI may be
    optimized on an incomplete objective while the users seek to fulfill
    multiple objectives in real-world applications. For example, a
    doctor needs to ensure a treatment plan is effective as well as has
    acceptable patient adherence. Ethical and legal requirements may
    also be included as objectives.



3 Explanatory form
The following 12 explanatory forms are end-user-friendly, i.e.: no technical knowledge is required for the end-user to interpret the explanation.


Feature-Based Explanation
Feature Attribution - fa    
Note: for tasks that has image as input data, the feature attribution is denoted by the following two cards:
ir:  important regions (a.k.a. heat map or saliency map)
irc: important regions with their feature contribution percentage

Example-Based Explanation


Similar Example - se
Typical Example - te

Counterfactual Example - ce


Note: for contractual example, there were two visual variations used in the user study:
cet:  counterfactual example with transition from one example to the counterfactual one
ceh:  counterfactual example with the contrastive feature highlighted



Rule-Based Explanation


Rule - rt
Decision Tree - dt

Decision Flow - df

Europarl,Europarl Dataset,"A corpus of parallel text in 21 European languages from the proceedings of the European Parliament.

The Europarl parallel corpus is extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament (1996-2011). It includes versions in 21 European languages: Romanic (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian), Germanic (English, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish), Slavik (Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, Slovene), Finni-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian), and Greek. Parallel sentence counts are in the range 400K-2M, depending on the language combination.

The goal of the extraction and processing was to generate sentence aligned text for statistical machine translation systems. For this purpose we extracted matching items and labeled them with corresponding document IDs. Using a preprocessor we identified sentence boundaries. We sentence aligned the data using a tool based on the Church and Gale algorithm.

The Europarl corpus was collected mainly to aid research in statistical machine translation (training, evaluation), but it has been used for many other natural language problems: word sense disambiguation, anaphora resolution, information extraction, etc.

Monolingual datasets are also available for 9 languages. These are supersets of the parallel versions. Monolingual word counts are in the range 7M-54M, depending on the language.

Test Sets: Several test sets have been released for the Europarl corpus. In general, the Q4/2000 portion of the data (2000-10 to 2000-12) should be reserved for testing.

FABSA,FABSA Dataset,"FABSA, An aspect-based sentiment analysis dataset in the Customer Feedback space (Trustpilot, Google Play and Apple Store reviews).

A professionally annotated dataset released by Chattermill AI, with 8 years of experience in leveraging advanced ML analytics in the customer feedback space for high-profile clients such as Amazon and Uber.

Two annotators possess extensive experience in developing human-labeled ABSA datasets for commercial companies, while the third annotator holds a PhD in computational linguistics.

There has been a lack of high-quality ABSA datasets covering broad domains and addressing real-world applications. Academic progress has been confined to benchmarking on domain-specific, toy datasets such as restaurants and laptops, which are limited in size (e.g., SemEval Task ABSA or SentiHood).

This dataset is part of the FABSA paper, and we release it hoping to advance academic progress as tools for ingesting and analyzing customer feedback at scale improve significantly, yet evaluation datasets continue to lag. FABSA is a new, large-scale, multi-domain ABSA dataset of feedback reviews, consisting of approximately 10,500 reviews spanning 10 domains (Fashion, Consulting, Travel Booking, Ride-hailing, Banking, Trading, Streaming, Price Comparison, Information Technology, and Groceries).

Financial_Dynamic_Knowledge_Graph,Financial Dynamic Knowledge Graph Dataset,"FinDKG: The Global Financial Dynamic Knowledge Graph Dataset
FinDKG is an open-source dataset focused on creating a temporally-resolved Financial Dynamic Knowledge Graph. Designed to bridge the gap in industry-specific knowledge graphs, particularly in the financial sector, FinDKG provides a high-touch, temporally-aware representation of global economic and market dynamics. This repository includes comprehensive details about the dataset, methodology, and schema, aiming to facilitate academic research and actionable insights in global financial markets.

Background
While general-purpose knowledge graphs are abundant, industry-specific ones are comparatively rare, especially in the financial sector. FinDKG aims to fill this void by offering a resource for researchers and professionals looking to leverage knowledge graph technology in finance.

FinDKG Dataset
The dataset's foundation lies in an extensive news corpus curated to capture both qualitative and quantitative indicators in the financial landscape. We utilized the Wayback Machine to amass a dataset comprising global financial news. 

Dataset Structure

Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) with daily-resolved event triplets
Event triplets are tagged with specific timestamps corresponding to their release dates
Training, validation, and test splits organized chronologically
Weekly aggregation of event triplets as the basic unit of time

Data Format
/FinDKG is the default study dataset folder including the graph dataset and the corresponding data splits. The graph dataset is organized in the following structure:



'train.txt', 'valid.txt', and 'test.txt': The first four columns correspond to subject, relation, object, and time. The fifth column is ignored.



'stat.txt': The first two columns correspond to the number of entities and relations, respectively.



Test set is held-out for evaluating the model performance. This should match the results of the original paper regarding the Temporal Link Prediction evaluation.

/FinDKG-full: The full dataset including a larger size of the event triplets. This graph dataset adopts the same format as /FinDKG while is left for future extended research.


'time2id.txt': This time mapping table further provided the mapping from time ID to realistic date for real-world application.

Usage
The dataset is designed for graph-based AI methods aiming to generate actionable insights in the financial domain. It is freely available for academic and research purposes. Refer details to our designated FinDKG website.

FOR-instance,FOR-instance Dataset,"The challenge of accurately segmenting individual trees from laser scanning data hinders the assessment of crucial tree parameters necessary for effective forest management, impacting many downstream applications. While dense laser scanning offers detailed 3D representations, automating the segmentation of trees and their structures from point clouds remains difficult. The lack of suitable benchmark datasets and reliance on small datasets have limited method development. The emergence of deep learning models exacerbates the need for standardized benchmarks. Addressing these gaps, the FOR-instance data represent a novel benchmarking dataset to enhance forest measurement using dense airborne laser scanning data, aiding researchers in advancing segmentation methods for forested 3D scenes.

In this repository, users will find forest laser scanning point clouds from unamnned aerial vehicle (using Riegl sensors) that are manually segmented according to the individual trees (1130 trees) and semantic classes. The point clouds are subdivided into five data collections representing different forests in Norway, the Czech Republic, Austria, New Zealand, and Australia. 

These data are meant to be used either for developement of new methods (using the dev data) or for testing of exisitng methods (test data). The data splits are provided in the data_split_metadata.csv file.

As a natural progression following the successful Inaugural Challenge FS#1, the FEARLESS STEPS Challenge Phase-#2 focuses on the development of single-channel supervised learning strategies. This FS#2 provides 80 hours of ground-truth data through Training and Development sets, with an additional 20 hours of blind-set Evaluation data. Based on feedback from the Fearless Steps participants, additional Tracks for streamlined speech recognition and speaker diarization have been included in the FS#2. The results for this Challenge will be presented at the ISCA INTERSPEECH-2020 Special Session. We encourage participants to explore any and all research tasks of interest with the Fearless Steps Corpus – with suggested Task Domains listed below. Research participants can, however, also utilize the FS#2 corpus to explore additional problems dealing with naturalistic data, which we welcome as part of the special session.

This collaboration integrated the expertise at both sites toward the goal of identifying cancer biomarkers that can be used to identify genetically defined subsets of patients most likely to respond to cancer therapies.

We screened >1000 genetically characterized human cancer cell lines with a wide range of anti-cancer therapeutics. These compounds included cytotoxic chemotherapeutics as well as targeted therapeutics from commercial sources, academic collaborators, and the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.

The sensitivity patterns of the cell lines were correlated with extensive genomic and expression data to identify genetic features that are predictive of sensitivity. This large collection of cell lines enabled us to capture much of the genomic heterogeneity that underlies human cancer, and which appears to play a critical role in determining the variable response of patients to treatment with specific agents.",https://www.cancerrxgene.org/,EditThe data files are experimental and academic in nature and are not licensed or certified by any regulatory body.

The dataset consists of three parts: Original Samples, Deepfakes, and the Fidelity Score Dataset.

The dataset is accessible via Box.com, which offers high availability worldwide and allows for access tracking.

Dataset Statistics:
Number of folder (or videos):
- Original : 675 (673k frames with 3 frame sizes each)
- Fake (DFL) : 26,085 (5.0M frames)
- Fake (Adaptive - DFL) : 7,215 (1.3M frames)
- Fake (FSGAN) : 25,433 (4.6M frames)
- Fake (LIA) : 25,662 (5.0M frames)

DFL quantized ready-to-use models : 60

Fidelity Score Dataset:
- Fake : 49,603 videos (32 frames each, 1.35M frames total)
- Real : 816 videos (32 frames each, 22k frames total)

Human evaluation dataset: 200 videos

Original Samples
While the paper focuses on 8 challenges, we collected 13 in total, which we share in full. The data is provided as frames extracted from raw HD videos recorded at 60 fps. We downsample the frames to approximately 10 fps for ease of use without any expected loss in generation fidelity. The images inside each zip file are face-only. We provide three convenient sizes: 224 x 224, 512 x 512, and 1024 x 1024 pixels.

Each zip file contains folders numbered according to the following challenges/tasks:


The camera moves around for about two minutes, capturing the face from different angles while the participant sits still.
The participant rotates their head from side to side, then looks up and down. Each side should be held for about 5 seconds, rotating as comfortably as possible, totaling around 25 seconds.
The participant covers their eyes with a hand, followed by covering the left half, the right half, and finally, the lower half of the face.
The participant puts on the provided sunglasses and then takes them off.
The participant wears the provided clear glasses, ensuring they reflect a lamp light shining. After setting up the reflection, recording starts. Finally, the participant removes the glasses.
The participant moves a green cloth in front of their face
The participant puts on a face mask and counts from 1 to 10 out loud. Then, they remove the facemask.
The participant presses a finger against a cheek.
The participant sticks out a (small) portion of their tongue.
The participant laughs for 10 seconds, then frowns, as if angry, for another 10 seconds.
The participant slowly stands up and then sits back down.
The participant counts from 1 to 50 with distinct breaks between each utterance.
The room light is dimmed, and a flashing light is kept on the face for 10 seconds.

TODO: Verify each challenge index above corresponds to that challenge in the zips.

Note: A few challenges are missing from a handful of participants. 

Fakes
Using 47 participants, we create deepfakes between all 2,209 (47 x 47) combinations (including self deepfake), using three deepfake generators — DeepFaceLab, FSGANv2, and LIA. 



DFL (DeepFaceLab): Notorious for generating hyper-realistic deepfakes, this pipeline serves as a baseline for in-the-wild deepfake videos. For our study, we trained individual DFL deepfake generators for each participant using their `no challenge' videos. These videos records the participants in a range of frontal angles while they sit naturally, aiming to mimic the kind of data readily accessible online for non-celebrity individuals. Training continued until convergence for approximately around 300,000 iterations. 

DFL (Adaptive Adversary): We utilized heavily trained celebrity deepfake generators provided by the community as an adaptive adversary. Such models are trained on upwards of 2M iterations.

The DFL models trained by us and the ones provided by the community  are available under dfm_models folder, including the hyperparameters in states.dat file. The models can be loaded directly into Deepfacelive to generate deepfakes.



FSGAN (Face Swapping Generative Adversarial Network): This corresponds to the second version of FSGAN. Similar to LIA, this model is also target-agnostic, hence we utilized a pre-trained model made available by the authors for our study. Access its release at https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/fsgan


LIA (Latent Image Animator): This pipeline is a facial reenactment method outlined in. Given its target-agnostic nature—meaning it does not require specific target data during inference—we employed a pre-trained model for our experiments. Access its release at https://github.com/wyhsirius/LIA

As a rule of thumb, An imposter outer face and target is the inner face, in case of faceswaps. 

While Box offers quick zipping of multiple files, we have placed the files into zips (<10 GB each), for convenient access. Each zip under fakes (except Adaptive Adversary) is organized in path : “target/challenge/imposter/.jpg”. For Adaptive Adversary, the order is opposite, i.e., “imposter/challenge/target/.jpg”

Fidelity Score Dataset (or a Snapshot of the full dataset)
The training subset contains the following subselections:


Original and deepfake videos with four challenges, one from each category and ‘no challenge’.
32 frames per sample,
35 out of 47 target identities, and
Deepfake videos created using only DFL.

The validation dataset consists of the remaining 12 out of 47 target identities, while test one includes the celebrity deepfakes. The dataset is the smallest snapshot of the full dataset.

Numerical Variation refers to altering the numerical data or its types, including 3 subcategories: Numerical Substitution, Digit Expansion, and Integer-decimal-fraction Conversion.
Arithmetic Variation refers to reversing or introducing additional operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to math problems, including 2 subcategories: Adding Operation and Reversing Operation.
Problem Understanding refers to rephrasing the text description of the math problems.
Distractor Insertion refers to inserting topic-related but useless sentences to the problems.
Critical Thinking focuses on question or doubt ability when the question lacks necessary statements.

To this end, we propose a method to create a unified dataset for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. Our method produces annotations of the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, along with their interaction labels for each frame. Our dataset, called H2O (2 Hands and Objects), provides synchronized multi-view RGB-D images, interaction labels, object classes, ground-truth 3D poses for left & right hands, 6D object poses, ground-truth camera poses, object meshes and scene point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that enables the study of first-person actions with the use of the pose of both left and right hands manipulating objects and presents an unprecedented level of detail for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. We further propose the method to predict interaction classes by estimating the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, jointly from RGB images. Our method models both inter- and intra-dependencies between both hands and objects by learning the topology of a graph convolutional network that predicts interactions.

HARPER,HARPER Dataset,"We introduce HARPER, a novel dataset for 3D body pose estimation and forecast in dyadic interactions between users and \spot, the quadruped robot manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The key-novelty is the focus on the robot's perspective, i.e., on the data captured by the robot's sensors. These make 3D body pose analysis challenging because being close to the ground captures humans only partially. The scenario underlying HARPER includes 15 actions, of which 10 involve physical contact between the robot and users. The Corpus contains not only the recordings of the built-in stereo cameras of Spot, but also those of a 6-camera OptiTrack system (all recordings are synchronized). This leads to ground-truth skeletal representations with a precision lower than a millimeter. In addition, the Corpus includes reproducible benchmarks on 3D Human Pose Estimation, Human Pose Forecasting, and Collision Prediction, all based on publicly available baseline approaches. This enables future HARPER users to rigorously compare their results with those we provide in this work.

HatEval,HatEval Dataset,"Hate Speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristics. Given the huge amount of user-generated contents on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, and therefore possibly limit the Hate Speech diffusion, is becoming fundamental, for instance for fighting against misogyny and xenophobia.

The proposed task consists in Hate Speech detection in Twitter but featured by two specific different targets, immigrants and women, in a multilingual perspective, for Spanish and English. The task will be articulated around two related subtasks for each of the involved languages: a basic task about Hate Speech, and another one where fine-grained features of hateful contents will be investigated in order to understand how existing approaches may deal with the identification of especially dangerous forms of hate, i.e. those where the incitement is against an individual rather than against a group of people, and where an aggressive behavior of the author can be identified as a prominent feature of the expression of hate. Participants will be asked to identify, on the one hand, if the target of hate is a single human or a group of persons, on the other hand, if the message author intends to be aggressive, harmful, or even to incite, in various forms, to violent acts against the target.


TASK A - Hate Speech Detection against Immigrants and Women: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to predict whether a tweet in English or in Spanish with a given target (women or immigrants) is hateful or not hateful.
TASK B - Aggressive behavior and Target Classification: where systems are asked first to classify hateful tweets for English and Spanish (e.g., tweets where Hate Speech against women or immigrants has been identified) as aggressive or not aggressive, and second to identify the target harassed as individual or generic (i.e. single human or group).",https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19935,EditCC-BY-NC-4.0,"Audio, Image",,,,,,,,Hate Speech Detection,hate-speech-detection-on-hateval,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hateval,Speech,Hate Speech Detection,Hate Speech Detection

Until now, most studies have focused on solving this problem of negativity in the English language, though the problem is much more than just harmful content. Furthermore, it is multilingual as well. Thus, we have constructed a Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (HopeEDI) containing user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with 28,451, 20,198 and 10,705 comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as containing hope speech or not.

Or where household objects or continual learning are of interest.

Our dataset contains 150,795 unique synthetic images using 25 different household categories with 925 3D models in total. For each of those categories, we generated about 6000 RGB images. In addition, we also provide a corresponding depth, segmentation, and normal image.

The dataset was created with BlenderProc [Denninger et al. (2019)], a procedural pipeline to generate images for deep learning.
This tool created a virtual room with randomly textured floors, walls, and a light source with randomly chosen light intensity and color. After that, a 3D model is placed in the resulting room. This object gets customized by randomly assigning materials, including different textures, to achieve a diverse dataset. Moreover, each object might be deformed with a random
displacement texture.
We use 774 3D models from the ShapeNet dataset [A. X. Chang et al. (2015)] and the other models from various internet sites. Please note that we had to manually fix and filter most of the models with Blender before using them in the pipeline!

For continual learning (CL), we provide two different loading schemes:
- Five sequences with five categories each
- Twelve sequences with three categories in the first and two in the other sequences.

In addition to the RGB, depth, segmentation, and normal images, we also provide the calculated features of the RGB images (by ResNet50) as used in our RECALL paper.
In those two loading schemes, ten percent of the images are used for validation, where we ensure that an object instance is either in the training or the validation set, not in both. This avoids learning to recognize certain instances by heart.

We recommend using those loading schemes to compare your approach with others.

IBM_Transactions_for_Anti_Money_Laundering,IBM Transactions for Anti Money Laundering Dataset,"Money laundering is a multi-billion dollar issue. Detection of laundering is very difficult. Most automated algorithms have a high false positive rate: legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as laundering. The converse is also a major problem -- false negatives, i.e. undetected laundering transactions. Naturally, criminals work hard to cover their tracks.

Access to real financial transaction data is highly restricted -- for both proprietary and privacy reasons. Even when access is possible, it is problematic to provide a correct tag (laundering or legitimate) to each transaction -- as noted above. This synthetic transaction data from IBM avoids these problems.

The data provided here is based on a virtual world inhabited by individuals, companies, and banks. Individuals interact with other individuals and companies. Likewise, companies interact with other companies and with individuals. These interactions can take many forms, e.g. purchase of consumer goods and services, purchase orders for industrial supplies, payment of salaries, repayment of loans, and more. These financial transactions are generally conducted via banks, i.e. the payer and receiver both have accounts, with accounts taking multiple forms from checking to credit cards to bitcoin.

Some (small) fraction of the individuals and companies in the generator model engage in criminal behavior -- such as smuggling, illegal gambling, extortion, and more. Criminals obtain funds from these illicit activities, and then try to hide the source of these illicit funds via a series of financial transactions. Such financial transactions to hide illicit funds constitute laundering. Thus, the data available here is labelled and can be used for training and testing AML (Anti Money Laundering) models and for other purposes.

The data generator that created the data here not only models illicit activity, but also tracks funds derived from illicit activity through arbitrarily many transactions -- thus creating the ability to label laundering transactions many steps removed from their illicit source. With this foundation, it is straightforward for the generator to label individual transactions as laundering or legitimate.",https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml,"EditCommunity Data License Agreement – Sharing, Version 1.0",Image,,,,,,,,Fraud Detection,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering,Computer Vision,Fraud Detection,Fraud Detection
ICASSP_2021_Acoustic_Echo_Cancellation_Challenge,ICASSP 2021 Acoustic Echo Cancellation Challenge Dataset,"The ICASSP 2021 Acoustic Echo Cancellation Challenge is intended to stimulate research in the area of acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), which is an important part of speech enhancement and still a top issue in audio communication and conferencing systems. Many recent AEC studies report good performance on synthetic datasets where the train and test samples come from the same underlying distribution. However, the AEC performance often degrades significantly on real recordings. Also, most of the conventional objective metrics such as echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) do not correlate well with subjective speech quality tests in the presence of background noise and reverberation found in realistic environments. In this challenge, we open source two large datasets to train AEC models under both single talk and double talk scenarios. These datasets consist of recordings from more than 2,500 real audio devices and human speakers in real environments, as well as a synthetic dataset. We open source two large test sets, and we open source an online subjective test framework for researchers to quickly test their results. The winners of this challenge will be selected based on the average Mean Opinion Score (MOS) achieved across all different single talk and double talk scenarios.",https://github.com/microsoft/AEC-Challenge,EditUnknown,Audio,,2021,,,,,,Acoustic echo cancellation,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/icassp-2021-acoustic-echo-cancellation,Audio,Acoustic echo cancellation,Acoustic echo cancellation

ImageNet-1k_vs_NINCO,ImageNet-1k vs NINCO Dataset,"The NINCO (No ImageNet Class Objects) dataset is introduced in the ICML 2023 paper In or Out? Fixing ImageNet Out-of-Distribution Detection Evaluation. The images in this dataset are free from objects that belong to any of the 1000 classes of ImageNet-1K (ILSVRC2012), which makes NINCO suitable for evaluating out-of-distribution detection on ImageNet-1K .

The NINCO main dataset consists of 64 OOD classes with a total of 5879 samples. These OOD classes were selected to have no categorical overlap with any classes of ImageNet-1K. Each sample was inspected individually by the authors to not contain ID objects.

Besides NINCO, included are (in the same .tar.gz file) truly OOD versions of 11 popular OOD datasets with in total 2715 OOD samples.

Further included are 17 OOD unit-tests, with 400 samples each.

Code for loading and evaluating on each of the three datasets is provided at https://github.com/j-cb/NINCO.

Adversarial patches are optimized contiguous pixel blocks in an input image that cause a machine-learning model to misclassify it. However, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. To overcome these issues, we propose ImageNet-Patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against adversarial patches. It consists of a set of patches, optimized to generalize across different models, and readily applicable to ImageNet data after preprocessing them with affine transformations. This process enables an approximate yet faster robustness evaluation, leveraging the transferability of adversarial perturbations.",https://github.com/pralab/ImageNet-Patch,EditUnknown,Image,English,,,,,,,"Adversarial Robustness, Image Classification",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet-patch,Adversarial,Adversarial Robustness,Adversarial Robustness

InaGVAD contains 277 1-minute-long annotated recordings, partitioned into a 1h development and 3h37 test subset, allowing fair and reproducible system evaluation. Evaluation scripts provided with the corpus provide performance estimates in the same conditions as the 6 VAD and 3 SGS systems presented in the associated paper. Recordings were collected from 10 French radio and 18 TV channels categorized into 4 groups associated to diverse acoustic conditions : generalist radio, music radio, news TV, and generalist TV.

InaGVAD provides an extended VAD and SGS annotation scheme, allowing to describe systems diverse abilities based on :
* Speaker Traits categories
 3 Genders : Female, Male, I Don't Know (IDK)
 3 Age groups : Young (prepubescent), Adult, Ederly (Senior)
* 3 Speech Qualities : standard, interjections (ah, oh, eg, aie), atypical (crying, laughing or shouted speech, ill person voice, artificially distorted voices, vocal performance, monster voice...)
10 Non-Speech event categories : Applause, environmental noise, hubbub, jingle, foreground music, background music, respiration, non-intelligible laughers, other, empty

InBreast,InBreast Dataset,"Rationale and objectives: Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed in the past two decades to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on breast imaging exams, thus providing a second opinion. Mammographic databases play an important role in the development of algorithms aiming at the detection and diagnosis of mammary lesions. However, available databases often do not take into consideration all the requirements needed for research and study purposes. This article aims to present and detail a new mammographic database.

Materials and methods: Images were acquired at a breast center located in a university hospital (Centro Hospitalar de S. João [CHSJ], Breast Centre, Porto) with the permission of the Portuguese National Committee of Data Protection and Hospital's Ethics Committee. MammoNovation Siemens full-field digital mammography, with a solid-state detector of amorphous selenium was used.

Results: The new database-INbreast-has a total of 115 cases (410 images) from which 90 cases are from women with both breasts affected (four images per case) and 25 cases are from mastectomy patients (two images per case). Several types of lesions (masses, calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions) were included. Accurate contours made by specialists are also provided in XML format.

Conclusion: The strengths of the actually presented database-INbreast-relies on the fact that it was built with full-field digital mammograms (in opposition to digitized mammograms), it presents a wide variability of cases, and is made publicly available together with precise annotations. We believe that this database can be a reference for future works centered or related to breast cancer imaging.",,EditUnknown,Image,,,,,410 images,,,"Cancer-no cancer per breast classification, Suspicous (BIRADS 4,5)-no suspicous (BIRADS 1,2,3) per image classification","cancer-no-cancer-per-breast-classification-on-1, suspicous-birads-45-no-suspicous-birads-123",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/inbreast,Computer Vision,Cancer-no cancer per breast classification,Cancer-no cancer per breast classification

The dataset contains features derived from IoT (machine log) and enterprise data including labels for escalation from a fleet of thousands of customers of high-end medical devices. 

The dataset accompanies the publication ""System Design for a Data-driven and Explainable Customer Sentiment Monitor"" (submitted). We provide an anonymized version of data collected over a period of two years.

The dataset should fuel the research and development of new machine learning algorithms to better cope with real-world data challenges including sparse and noisy labels, and concept drifts. Additional challenges are the optimal fusion of enterprise and log-based features for the prediction task. Thereby, the interpretability of designed prediction models should be ensured in order to have practical relevancy.

However, the AEC performance often degrades significantly on real recordings. Also, most of the conventional objective metrics such as echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) do not correlate well with subjective speech quality tests in the presence of background noise and reverberation found in realistic environments. In this challenge, we open source two large datasets to train AEC models under both single talk and double talk scenarios. These datasets consist of recordings from more than 5,000 real audio devices and human speakers in real environments, as well as a synthetic dataset.

IoT_ENVIRONMENT_DATASET,IoT ENVIRONMENT DATASET Dataset,"ABSTRACT
Recently, the technology of the fourth revolution has given the characteristics of things constantly expanding, and everything, including people, things, people, and the environment, is connected based on the Internet. In particular, the network structure is connected to various IoT devices and is changing from wired to wireless. Unlike users who operated each device, other devices can now be operated through gateways inside and outside the smart home. However, these changes have created an environment vulnerable to external attacks, and when an attacker accesses a gateway, he can attempt various attacks, including Port scans, OS&Service detection, and DoS attacks on IoT devices. Therefore, we disclose the dataset below to promote security research on IoT.

1. DATASET
We provide IoT environment datasets which include Port Scan, OS & Service Detection, and HTTP Flooding Attack. After setting up the environment of IoT devices, we captured packets using Wireshark.

1.3 COMPARISON WITH IoT NETWORK INTRUSION DATASET
This dataset has similarities with our other IoT dataset (IoT Network Intrusion Dataset), so we summarized the difference of two datasets as below.

This dataset contains traffic of more various IoT devices: two security cameras, two AI speakers and a smart light hub as described in 1.1. Configuration of IoT Environment.

IoT Network Intrusion Dataset only contains traffic of two IoT devices: SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P).

There are less attack scenarios in this dataset; IoT Network Intrusion Dataset includes MITM, flooding attacks besides HTTP flooding, and telnet bruteforce, which are not in this dataset.

Also, HTTP flooding attacks are in both datasets, but have different attackers and targets.

In the case of this dataset, the attacker is the laptop and the target is the IoT device (Google Home Mini).

In the case of IoT Network Intrusion Dataset, the attacker is the IoT device (assumed it is compromised by Mirai Botnet) and the target is a victim server.

We created various types of network attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) environment for academic purpose. Two typical smart home devices -- SKT NUGU (NU 100) and EZVIZ Wi-Fi Camera (C2C Mini O Plus 1080P) -- were used. All devices, including some laptops or smart phones, were connected to the same wireless network. The dataset consists of 42 raw network packet files (pcap) at different time points.



The packet files are captured by using monitor mode of wireless network adapter. The wireless headers are removed by Aircrack-ng.



All attacks except Mirai Botnet category are the packets captured while simulating attacks using tools such as Nmap. The case of Mirai Botnet category, the attack packets were generated on a laptop and then manipulated to make it appear as if it originated from the IoT device.



Revision History


Three more packet files of Mirai Botnet -- Host Discovery and Telnet Bruteforce -- were added on September 20, 2019.

IRIDIA-AF,IRIDIA-AF Dataset,"A large paroxysmal atrial fibrillation long-term electrocardiogram monitoring database
Abstract
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia in adults. Holter monitoring, a long-term 2-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), is a key tool available to cardiologists for AF diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown great capacity to automatically detect AF in ECG and their use as medical decision support tool is growing. Training these models rely on a few open and annotated databases. We present a new Holter monitoring database from patients with paroxysmal AF with 167 records from 152 patients, acquired from an outpatient cardiology clinic from 2006 to 2017 in Belgium. AF episodes were manually annotated and reviewed by an expert cardiologist and a specialist cardiac nurse. Records last from 19 hours up to 95 hours, divided into 24-hour files. In total, it represents 24 million seconds of annotated Holter monitoring, sampled at 200 Hz. This dataset aims at expanding the available options for researchers and offers a valuable resource for advancing ML and DL use in the field of cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis.

ISAdetect_dataset,ISAdetect dataset Dataset,"This repository holds two datasets: one with both the original binaries and the code sections extracted from them (“full dataset”), and one with only the code sections (“only code sections”). The code sections were extracted by carving out sections of the binary that were marked as executable. The binaries were scraped from Debian repositories.

There are also two CSV files available, one with full binaries and one with only code sections, which include the 293 features extracted from about 3000 binaries per architecture. These features can be used to train classifiers.

The dataset consists of thousands of binaries for the following 23 architectures: alpha, amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mips64el, mipsel, powerpc, powerpcspe, powerpc64, powerpc64el, riscv, s390, s390x, sh4, sparc, sparc64 and x32.

There are 98 500 binary files, about 27 gigabytes (uncompressed) of binary files and about 15 gigabytes (uncompressed) of only code sections from those binary files.

Both datasets hold the binaries in directories named by the architecture. The files inside the folders are named as MD5 hashes of the original binary files, and a hash file ending with “.code” contains only the concatenation of all code sections of the original binary file. Each architecture folder also holds a JSON file named after the architecture, e.g. amd64 holds amd64.json. The structure of the JSON file is as follows (described in a JSON Schema-like notation)

iSarcasm,iSarcasm Dataset,"iSarcasm is a dataset of tweets, each labelled as either sarcastic or non_sarcastic. Each sarcastic tweet is further labelled for one of the following types of ironic speech:


sarcasm: tweets that contradict the state of affairs and are critical towards an addressee;
irony: tweets that contradict the state of affairs but are not obviously critical towards an addressee;
satire: tweets that appear to support an addressee, but contain underlying disagreement and mocking;
understatement: tweets that undermine the importance of the state of affairs they refer to;
overstatement: tweets that describe the state of affairs in obviously exaggerated terms;
rhetorical question: tweets that include a question whose invited inference (implicature) is obviously contradicting the state of affairs.

For each sarastic tweet, there's also:


an explanation, in English sentences, as to why it is sarcastic, and
a rephrase that conveys the same meaning non-sarcastically. Both have been provided by the author of the tweet.

iSarcasm contains 4,484 tweets, out of which 777 are labelled as sarcastic and 3,707 as non-sarcastic. You'll find two files, isarcasm_train.csv and isarcasm_test.csv, each containing 80% and 20% of the examples chosen at random, respectively.

Following the MASSIVE NLU dataset, a pool of 70+ volunteers has been recruited to annotate the dataset. The volunteers were asked to record their voice while reading the utterances (the original text is available on MASSIVE dataset). Together with the audio, the volunteers were asked to provide a self-annotated description of the recording conditions (e.g., background noise, recording device). The audio recordings have also been validated and, in case of errors, re-recorded by the volunteers.

JAAD,JAAD Dataset,"JAAD is a dataset for studying joint attention in the context of autonomous driving. The focus is on pedestrian and driver behaviors at the point of crossing and factors that influence them. To this end, JAAD dataset provides a richly annotated collection of 346 short video clips (5-10 sec long) extracted from over 240 hours of driving footage. These videos filmed in several locations in North America and Eastern Europe represent scenes typical for everyday urban driving in various weather conditions.

Bounding boxes with occlusion tags are provided for all pedestrians making this dataset suitable for pedestrian detection.

Behavior annotations specify behaviors for pedestrians that interact with or require attention of the driver. For each video there are several tags (weather, locations, etc.) and timestamped behavior labels from a fixed list (e.g. stopped, walking, looking, etc.). In addition, a list of demographic attributes is provided for each pedestrian (e.g. age, gender, direction of motion, etc.) as well as a list of visible traffic scene elements (e.g. stop sign, traffic signal, etc.) for each frame.

Kaggle_EyePACS,Kaggle EyePACS Dataset,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

retina

The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 29.1 million people in the US have diabetes and the World Health Organization estimates that 347 million people have the disease worldwide. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with long-standing diabetes. Around 40% to 45% of Americans with diabetes have some stage of the disease. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or averted if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.

Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process that requires a trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina. By the time human readers submit their reviews, often a day or two later, the delayed results lead to lost follow up, miscommunication, and delayed treatment.

Clinicians can identify DR by the presence of lesions associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease. While this approach is effective, its resource demands are high. The expertise and equipment required are often lacking in areas where the rate of diabetes in local populations is high and DR detection is most needed. As the number of individuals with diabetes continues to grow, the infrastructure needed to prevent blindness due to DR will become even more insufficient.

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of DR screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. With color fundus photography as input, the goal of this competition is to push an automated detection system to the limit of what is possible – ideally resulting in models with realistic clinical potential. The winning models will be open sourced to maximize the impact such a model can have on improving DR detection.

Kitsune_Network_Attack_Dataset,Kitsune Network Attack Dataset Dataset,"Kitsune Network Attack Dataset
This is a collection of nine network attack datasets captured from a either an IP-based commercial surveillance system or a network full of IoT devices. Each dataset contains millions of network packets and diffrent cyber attack within it.

For each attack, you are supplied with:


A preprocessed dataset in csv format (ready for machine learning)
The corresponding label vector in csv format
The original network capture in pcap format (in case you want to engineer your own features)

We will now describe in detail what's in these datasets and how they were collected.

The Network Attacks
We have collected a wide variety of attacks which you would find in a real network intrusion. The following is a list of the cyber attack datasets avalaible:

<img src=""https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F827271%2F79e305668553e521b0709a2413323c45%2Fkaggle_dataset_table.png?generation=1598461684070844&alt=media"" alt=""image"" width=""100"">

For more details on the attacks themselves, please refer to our NDSS paper (citation below).

The Data Collection
The following figure presents the network topologies which we used to collect the data, and the corrisponding attack vectors at which the attacks were performed. The network capture took place at point 1 and point X at the router (where a network intrusion detection system could feasibly be placed).
For each dataset, clean network traffic was captured for the first 1 million packets, then the cyber attack was performed.

The Dataset Format
Each preprocessed dataset csv has m rows (packets) and 115 columns (features) with no header. The 115 features were extracted using our AfterImage feature extractor, described in our NDSS paper (see below) and available in Python here.
In summary, the 115 features provide a statistical snapshot of the network (hosts and behaviors) in the context of the current packet traversing the network. The AfterImage feature extractor is unique in that it can efficiently process millions of streams (network channels) in real-time, incrementally, making it suitable for handling network traffic.

KITTI-C is an evaluation benchmark heading toward robust and reliable 3D object detection in autonomous driving. With it, we probe the robustness of 3D detectors under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios against corruptions that occur in the real-world environment. Specifically, we consider natural corruptions happen in the following cases:


Adverse weather conditions, such as fog, wet ground, and snow;
External disturbances that are caused by motion blur or result in LiDAR beam missing;
Internal sensor failure, including crosstalk, possible incomplete echo, and cross-sensor scenarios.

KoNViD-1k,KoNViD-1k Dataset,"Subjective video quality assessment (VQA) strongly depends on semantics, context, and the types of visual distortions. A lot of existing VQA databases cover small numbers of video sequences with artificial distortions. When testing newly developed Quality of Experience (QoE) models and metrics, they are commonly evaluated against subjective data from such databases, that are the result of perception experiments. However, since the aim of these QoE models is to accurately predict natural videos, these artificially distorted video databases are an insufficient basis for learning. Additionally, the small sizes make them only marginally usable for state-of-the-art learning systems, such as deep learning. In order to give a better basis for development and evaluation of objective VQA methods, we have created a larger datasets of natural, real-world video sequences with corresponding subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) gathered through crowdsourcing.
​

L-Eval,L-Eval Dataset,"Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance for many language tasks, most of them can only handle texts a few thousand tokens long, limiting their applications on longer sequence inputs, such as books, reports, and codebases. Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs' long context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated memory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating long context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench, the first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench comprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese, with an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters (Chinese). These tasks cover key long-text application areas including single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. All datasets in LongBench are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Upon comprehensive evaluation of 8 LLMs on LongBench, we find that: (1) Commercial model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k) outperforms other open-sourced models, but still struggles on longer contexts. (2) Scaled position embedding and fine-tuning on longer sequences lead to substantial improvement on long context understanding. (3) Context compression technique such as retrieval brings improvement for model with weak ability on long contexts, but the performance still lags behind models that have strong long context understanding capability.

L3DAS22,L3DAS22 Dataset,"L3DAS22: MACHINE LEARNING FOR 3D AUDIO SIGNAL PROCESSING
This dataset supports the L3DAS22 IEEE ICASSP Gand Challenge. The challenge is supported by a Python API that facilitates the dataset download and preprocessing, the training and evaluation of the baseline models and the results submission.

Scope of the Challenge
The L3DAS22 Challenge aims at encouraging and fostering research on machine learning for 3D audio signal processing.
3D audio is gaining increasing interest in the machine learning community in recent years. The range of applications is incredibly wide, extending from virtual and real conferencing to autonomous driving, surveillance and many more. In these contexts, a fundamental procedure is to properly identify the nature of events present in a soundscape, their spatial position and eventually remove unwanted noises that can interfere with the useful signal. To this end, L3DAS22 Challenge presents two tasks: 3D Speech Enhancement and 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection, both relying on first-order Ambisonics recordings in reverberant office environments.
Each task involves 2 separate tracks: 1-mic and 2-mic recordings, respectively containing sounds acquired by one 1st order Ambisonics microphone and by an array of two ones. The use of two Ambisonics microphones represents one of the main novelties of the L3DAS22 Challenge. We expect higher accuracy/reconstruction quality when taking advantage of the dual spatial perspective of the two microphones. Moreover, we are very interested in identifying other possible advantages of this configuration over standard Ambisonics formats.
Interactive demos of our baseline models are available on Replicate.
Top 5 ranked teams can submit a regular paper according to the ICASSP guidelines.
Prizes will be awarded to the challenge winners thanks to the support of Kuaishou Technology.

Tasks
Tasks
The tasks we propose are:
  * 3D Speech Enhancement
The objective of this task is the enhancement of speech signals immersed in the spatial sound field of a reverberant office environment. Here the models are expected to extract the monophonic voice signal from the 3D mixture containing various background noises. The evaluation metric for this task is a combination of short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and word error rate (WER).
  * 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection
The aim of this task is to detect the temporal activities of a known set of sound event classes and, in particular, to further locate them in the space. Here the models must predict a list of the active sound events and their respective location at regular intervals of 100 milliseconds. Performance on this task is evaluated according to the location-sensitive detection error, which joins the localization and detection error metrics.

Dataset Info
The L3DAS22 datasets contain multiple-source and multiple-perspective B-format Ambisonics audio recordings. We sampled the acoustic field of a large office room, placing two first-order Ambisonics microphones in the center of the room and moving a speaker reproducing the analytic signal in 252 fixed spatial positions. Relying on the collected Ambisonics impulse responses (IRs), we augmented existing clean monophonic datasets to obtain synthetic tridimensional sound sources by convolving the original sounds with our IRs. We extracted speech signals from the Librispeech dataset and office-like background noises from the FSD50K dataset. We aimed at creating plausible and variegate 3D scenarios to reflect possible real-life situations in which sound and disparate types of background noises coexist in the same 3D reverberant environment. We provide normalized raw waveforms as predictors data and the target data varies according to the task.

The dataset is divided in two main sections, respectively dedicated to the challenge tasks.

The first section is optimized for 3D Speech Enhancement and contains more than 60000 virtual 3D audio environments with a duration up to 12 seconds. In each sample, a spoken voice is always present alongside with other office-like background noises. As target data for this section we provide the clean monophonic voice signals. For each subset we also provide a csv file, where we annotated the coordinates and spatial distance of the IR convolved with the target voice signals for each datapoint. This may be useful to estimate the delay caused by the virtual time-of-flight of the target voice signal and to perform a sample-level alignment of the input and ground truth signals.

The other sections, instead, is dedicated to the 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection task and contains 900 30-seconds-long audio files. Each data point contains a simulated 3D office audio environment in which up to 3 simultaneous acoustic events may be active at the same time. In this section, the samples are not forced to contain a spoken voice. As target data for this section we provide a list of the onset and offset time stamps, the typology class, and the spatial coordinates of each individual sound event present in the data-points.

We split both dataset sections into a training set and a development set, paying attention to create similar distributions. The train set of the SE section is divided in two partitions: train360 and train100, and contain speech samples extracted from the correspondent partitions of Librispeech (only the sample) up to 12 seconds. The train360 is split in 2 zip files for a more convenient download. All sets of the SELD section are divided in: OV1, OV2, OV3. These partitions refer to the maximum amount of possible overlapping sounds, which are 1, 2 or 3, respectively.

L3DAS22 Challenge Supporting API
The gitHub supporting API is aimed at downloading the dataset, pre-processing the sound files and the metadata, training and evaluating the baseline models and validating the final results. We provide easy-to-use instruction to produce the results included in our paper. Moreover, we extensively commented our code for easy customization.

LabPics,LabPics Dataset,"LabPics Chemistry Dataset

Dataset for computer vision for materials segmentation and classification in chemistry labs, medical labs, and any setting where materials are handled inside containers.
The Vector-LabPics dataset comprises 7900 images of materials in various phases and processes within mostly transparent vessels in chemistry labs, medical labs and hospitals, and other environments. The images are annotated for both the vessels and the individual material phases inside them, and each instance is assigned one or more classes (liquid, solid, foam, suspension, powder, gel, granular, vapor) . The fill level, labels, corks, and other parts of the vessel are also annotated. The material classes cover the main states of matter, including liquids, solids, vapors, foams, gels, and subcategories like powder, granular, and suspension. Relationships between materials, such as which material is immersed inside other materials, are annotated. The vessel class cover glassware, labware plates, bottles, and any other type of vessel that is used to contain or carry materials. The type of vessel (e.g., syringe, tube, cup, infusion bottle/bag), and the properties of the vessel (transparent, opaque) are annotated. In addition, vessel parts such as corks, labels, spikes, and valves are annotated. Relations and hierarchies between vessels and materials are also annotated, such as which vessel contains which material or which vessels are linked or contain each other. The images were collected from various contributors and covered most aspects of chemistry lab works as well as a variety of other fields where materials are handled in container vessels. Documents specifying annotation formats are available inside the dataset file. Version 1 contain 2200 images with simple instance and semantic annotations, and is relatively simple to use, it is described in the paper ""Computer Vision for Recognition of Materials and Vessels in Chemistry Lab Settings and the Vector-LabPics Data Set""

Format

The dataset contains annotated images for both material and vessels in chemistry labs, medical labs, and any area where liquids and solids are handled within vessels. There are two levels of annotation for each image. One annotation set for vessels and the second for the material phases inside these vessels. Vessels are defined as any container that can carry materials such as Jars, Erlenmayers, Tubes, Funnels, syringes, IV bags, and any other labware or glassware that can contain or carry materials. Material phases are any material contained within or on the vessel. For example, for two-phase separating liquids, each liquid phase is annotated as one instance. If there is foam above the liquid or a chunk of solid inside the liquid, the foam, liquid, and solid will be annotated as different phases. In addition, vessel parts like cork, labels, and valves are annotated as instances. For each instance, there is a list of all the classes it belongs to, and a list of its property. For vessels, the instance classes are the vessel type (Cup, jar, Separatory-funnel…) and the vessel properties (Transparent, Opaque…). For materials, the classes are the material types ( Liquid, solid, suspension, foam, powder…) and their properties (Scattered, On vessel surface…), and for parts, the part type (cork/label). In addition, the relations between instances are annotated. This includes which material instances are inside which vessels, which vessels are linked to each other or are inside each other (for vessels inside other vessels), and which material phase is immersed inside another material phase. In addition to instance segmentation maps, the dataset also includes semantic segmentation maps that give each pixel in the image all the classes to which it belongs. In other words, for each class (Liquid, Solid, Vessel, Foam), there is a map of all the regions in the image belonging to this class. Note that every pixel and every instance can have several classes. In addition, instances often overlap, like in the case of material inside the vessel, vessel inside the vessel, and material phase immersed inside other material (like solid inside liquid).",https://www.cs.toronto.edu/chemselfies/,EditCC0 1.0 Universal,"Graph, Image",,,,,7900 images,"valves are annotated.

⚠️  Disclaimer & Content Warning (from the authors)
Our filtering protocol only removed NSFW images detected as illegal, but the dataset still has NSFW content accordingly marked in the metadata. When freely navigating through the dataset, keep in mind that it is a large-scale, non-curated set crawled from the internet for research purposes, such that collected links may lead to discomforting and disturbing content. Therefore, please use the demo links with caution. You can extract a “safe” subset by filtering out samples drawn with NSFW or via stricter CLIP filtering.

There is a certain degree of duplication because we used URL+text as deduplication criteria. The same image with the same caption may sit at different URLs, causing duplicates. The same image with other captions is not, however, considered duplicated.

LAM_line-level_,LAM(line-level) Dataset,"Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is an open
problem at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural
Language Processing. The main challenges, when dealing with
historical manuscripts, are due to the preservation of the paper
support, the variability of the handwriting – even of the same
author over a wide time-span – and the scarcity of data from
ancient, poorly represented languages. With the aim of fostering
the research on this topic, in this paper we present the Ludovico
Antonio Muratori (LAM) dataset, a large line-level HTR dataset
of Italian ancient manuscripts edited by a single author over
60 years. The dataset comes in two configurations: a basic
splitting and a date-based splitting which takes into account the
age of the author. The first setting is intended to study HTR
on ancient documents in Italian, while the second focuses on
the ability of HTR systems to recognize text written by the
same writer in time periods for which training data are not
available. For both configurations, we analyze quantitative and
qualitative characteristics, also with respect to other line-level
HTR benchmarks, and present the recognition performance of
state-of-the-art HTR architectures. The dataset is available for

Large_COVID-19_CT_scan_slice_dataset,Large COVID-19 CT scan slice dataset Dataset,"""We built a large lung CT scan dataset for COVID-19 by curating data from 7 public datasets listed in the acknowledgements. These datasets have been publicly used in COVID-19 diagnosis literature and proven their efficiency in deep learning applications. Therefore, the merged dataset is expected to improve the generalization ability of deep learning methods by learning from all these resources together.

These datasets are made available in different formats. Our goal is to provide a large dataset of COVID-19, Normal, and CAP CT slices together with their corresponding metadata. Some of the datasets consist of categorized CT slices, and some include CT volumes with annotated lesion slices. Therefore, we used the slice-level annotations to extract axial slices from CT volumes. We then converted all the images to 8-bit to have a consistent depth.

To ensure the dataset quality, we have removed the closed lung normal slices that do not carry information about inside lung manifestations. Additionally, we did not include images lacking clear class labels or patient information. In total, we have gathered 7,593 COVID-19 images from 466 patients, 6,893 normal images from 604 patients, and 2,618 CAP images from 60 patients. All of our CAP images are from Afshar et al. dataset, in which 25 cases are already annotated. Our radiologist has annotated the remaining 35 CT scan volumes. This is the largest COVID-19 lung CT dataset so far, to the best of our knowledge."" - Source: A Robust Ensemble-Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis based on an Integrated CT Scan Images Database

LiDAR-MOS,LiDAR-MOS Dataset,"Tasks.
In moving object segmentation of point cloud sequences, one has to provide motion labels for each point of the test sequences 11-21. Therefore, the input to all evaluated methods is a list of coordinates of the three-dimensional points along with their remission, i.e., the strength of the reflected laser beam which depends on the properties of the surface that was hit. Each method should then output a label for each point of a scan, i.e., one full turn of the rotating LiDAR sensor. Here, we only distinguish between static and moving object classes.

Metric
To assess the labeling performance, we rely on the commonly applied Jaccard Index or intersection-over-union (mIoU) metric over moving parts of the environment. We map all moving-x classes of the original SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation benchmark to a single moving object class.

LIVE-ETRI,LIVE-ETRI Dataset,"The video deployed parameter space is continuously increasing to provide more realistic and immersive experiences to global streaming and social media viewers. However, increments in video parameters such as spatial resolution or frame rate are inevitably associated with larger data volumes. Transmitting increasingly voluminous videos through limited bandwidth networks in a perceptually optimal way is a present challenge affecting billions of viewers. One recent practice adopted by the video service providers is space-time resolution adaptation in conjunction with video compression. Consequently, it is important to understand how different levels of space-time subsampling and compression affect the perceptual quality of videos.
Towards making progress in this direction, we constructed a large new resource, called the ETRI-LIVE Space-Time Subsampled Video Quality (ETRI-LIVE-STSVQ) database, containing 437 videos generated by applying various levels of combined space-time subsampling and video compression on 15 diverse video contents. We also conducted a large-scale human study on the new dataset, collecting about 15,000 subjective judgments of video quality. The ETRI-LIVE STSVQ database is being made publicly and freely available with the desire to improve future research and development on topics such as video quality modeling and perceptual video coding.",https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/index.html,EditCC,Video,,,,,,,,Video Quality Assessment,video-quality-assessment-on-live-etri,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/live-etri,Methodology,Video Quality Assessment,Video Quality Assessment

Efficient and accurate video quality predictors are needed to monitor and guide the processing of billions of shared, often imperfect, user-generated content (UGC). Unfortunately, current NR models are limited in their prediction capabilities on real-world, ""in-the-wild"" UGC video data. To advance progress on this problem, we created the largest (by far) subjective video quality dataset, containing 39, 000 real-world distorted videos and 117, 000 space-time localized video patches (""v-patches""), and 5.5M human perceptual quality annotations. Using this, we created two unique NR-VQA models: (a) a local-to-global region-based NR VQA architecture (called PVQ) that learns to predict global video quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 UGC datasets, and (b) a first-of-a-kind space-time video quality mapping engine (called PVQ Mapper) that helps localize and visualize perceptual distortions in space and time.

LIVE-VQC,LIVE-VQC Dataset,"The great variations of videographic skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, communication and bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current no-reference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly.

LM,LM Dataset,"The LM (Linemod) dataset is a valuable resource introduced by Stefan Hinterstoisser and colleagues in their research on model-based training, detection, and pose estimation of texture-less 3D objects in heavily cluttered scenes¹. Let's delve into the details:


Purpose and Context:
The primary goal of the LM dataset is to facilitate the development and evaluation of methods for detecting and estimating the 6 degrees-of-freedom pose of texture-less 3D objects.

It specifically targets scenarios where objects lack distinctive textures and are embedded in complex backgrounds with occlusions.



Methodology:


The dataset builds upon the LINEMOD approach, which combines depth and color information to create templates representing different views of an object.
LINEMOD templates are learned from 3D models and serve as a basis for object detection.

The initial LINEMOD method had limitations, including online template learning and approximate pose estimation.



Improvements and Contributions:


Hinterstoisser et al. enhance LINEMOD by incorporating accurate 3D models of objects.
Their approach leverages the 3D model to address the shortcomings of the original LINEMOD.
Notable improvements include better pose estimation and reduced false positives.

The proposed framework is suitable for robotics applications, such as object manipulation.



Dataset Details:


The LM dataset consists of 15 registered video sequences, each containing over 1100 frames.
These sequences feature 15 different texture-less household objects.
Objects in the dataset exhibit discriminative color, shape, and size characteristics.
Researchers can use this dataset to evaluate and compare their methods for object detection and pose estimation.



In summary, the LM dataset provides a valuable benchmark for advancing the field of 6D object pose estimation, especially in scenarios where texture information is limited¹². Researchers can access this dataset to test and refine their algorithms, ultimately contributing to advancements in robotics and machine vision.

The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time.

Final state particles, which make up the leaf nodes of generated topologies, are drawn with replacement from the following masses: [1, 2, 3, 5, 12]. For each intermediate particle (including the root), we limit the minimum number of children to two, and the maximum five.
The dataset contains the resulting simulated particle physics decays, with information about the detected particle (leaves) to be used as input, and Lowest Common Ancestor Generations (LCAGs) to be used as training targets.

Tree topology creation to generate the dataset was as follows:
starting from the root particle a set of children are selected from the available intermediate and final state particles such that the sum of their masses totals less than the root, this process is then repeated for each child particle which is not a final state particle and so on until only final state particles remain.

The M4 dataset consists of time series of yearly, quarterly, monthly and other (weekly, daily and hourly) data, which are divided into training and test sets. The minimum numbers of observations in the training test are 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series. The participants were asked to produce the following numbers of forecasts beyond the available data that they had been given: six for yearly, eight for quarterly, 18 for monthly series, 13 for weekly series and 14 and 48 forecasts respectively for the daily and hourly ones.

The M4 dataset was created by selecting a random sample of 100,000 time series from the ForeDeCk database. The selected series were then scaled to prevent negative observations and values lower than 10, thus avoiding possible problems when calculating various error measures. The scaling was performed by simply adding a constant to the series so that their minimum value was equal to 10 (29 occurrences across the whole dataset). In addition, any information that could possibly lead to the identification of the original series was removed so as to ensure the objectivity of the results. This included the starting dates of the series, which did not become available to the participants until the M4 had ended.",https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods,EditUnknown,Time Series,,,,,,,,"Time Series Forecasting, Meta-Learning",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/m4,Time Series,Time Series Forecasting,Time Series Forecasting
M4Raw,M4Raw Dataset,"Recently, low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained renewed interest to promote MRI accessibility and affordability worldwide. The presented M4Raw dataset aims to facilitate methodology development and reproducible research in this field. The dataset comprises multi-channel brain k-space data collected from 183 healthy volunteers using a 0.3 Tesla whole-body MRI system, and includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with in-plane resolution of ~1.2 mm and through-plane resolution of 5 mm. Importantly, each contrast contains multiple repetitions, which can be used individually or to form multi-repetition averaged images. After excluding motion-corrupted data, the partitioned training and validation subsets contain 1024 and 240 volumes, respectively. To demonstrate the potential utility of this dataset, we trained deep learning models for image denoising and parallel imaging tasks and compared their performance with traditional reconstruction methods. This M4Raw dataset will be valuable for the development of advanced data-driven methods specifically for low-field MRI. It can also serve as a benchmark dataset for general MRI reconstruction algorithms.

MaNGA’s goal is to understand the “life history” of present-day galaxies from imprinted clues of their birth and assembly, through their ongoing growth via star formation and merging, to their death from quenching at late times.

The primary MaNGA data products are composed of 3-D calibrated data cubes produced by the DRP[89] and 2-D maps of derived quantities, such as emission line fluxes, gas and stellar kinematics, and stellar population properties, produced by the DAP[149] from those cubes. The 3-D data cubes are constructed from a few tens to a few thousands of individual spectra that have been combined onto a regular grid. The 2-D maps of derived quantities are constructed by analyzing individual or binned groups of spaxels and constructing maps of the quantities at the relevant on-sky location.",https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga,EditUnknown,Image,,,,,,,,"Hyperspectral image analysis, Astronomy",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/manga,Computer Vision,Hyperspectral image analysis,Hyperspectral image analysis

MIMI_dataset,MIMI dataset Dataset,"Nowadays, new branches of research are proposing the use of non-traditional data sources for the study of migration trends in order to find an original methodology to answer open questions about cross-border human mobility.
The Multi-aspect Integrated Migration Indicators (MIMI) dataset is a new dataset to be exploited in migration studies as a concrete example of this new approach. It includes both official data about bidirectional human migration (traditional flow and stock data) with multidisciplinary variables and original indicators, including economic, demographic, cultural and geographic indicators, together with the Facebook Social Connectedness Index (SCI).
It results from the process of gathering, embedding and integrating traditional and novel variables, resulting in this new multidisciplinary dataset that could significantly contribute to nowcast/forecast bilateral migration trends and migration drivers.

Thanks to this variety of knowledge, experts from several research fields (demographers, sociologists, economists) could exploit MIMI to investigate the trends in the various  indicators, and the relationship among them. Moreover, it could be possible to develop complex models based on these data, able to assess human migration by evaluating related interdisciplinary drivers, as well as models able to nowcast and predict traditional migration indicators in accordance with original variables, such as the strength of social connectivity. Here, the SCI could have an important role. It measures the relative probability that two individuals across two countries are friends with each other on Facebook, therefore it could be employed as a proxy of social connections across borders, to be studied as a possible driver of migration. 

All in all, the motivations for building and releasing the MIMI dataset lie in the need of new perspectives, methods and analyses that can no longer prescind from taking into account a variety of new factors. The heterogeneous and multidimensional sets of data present in MIMI offer an all-encompassing overview of the characteristics of human migration, enabling a better understanding and an original potential exploration of the relationship between migration and non-traditional sources of data.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6360651,EditCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,,,,,,Data Visualization,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mimi-dataset,Methodology,Data Visualization,Data Visualization

MIT_Indoor_Scenes,MIT Indoor Scenes Dataset,"Context
This is the Original data provided by MIT .

Indoor scene recognition is a challenging open problem in high level vision. Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g., bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information.

Content
The database contains 67 Indoor categories, and a total of 15620 images. The number of images varies across categories, but there are at least 100 images per category. All images are in jpg format. The images provided here are for research purposes only.

This study was intended to replicate measurements made previously for planning the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST). Deployment and operations for this study were done by HAO staff, and ISFF provided equipment and some data management support.

MM-OR,MM-OR Dataset,"Operating rooms (ORs) are complex, high-stakes environments requiring precise understanding of interactions among medical staff, tools, and equipment for enhancing surgical assistance, situational awareness, and patient safety. Current datasets fall short in scale, realism and do not capture the multimodal nature of OR scenes, limiting progress in OR modeling. To this end, we introduce MM-OR, a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal OR dataset, and the first dataset to enable multimodal scene graph generation. MM-OR captures comprehensive OR scenes containing RGB-D data, detail views, audio, speech transcripts, robotic logs, and tracking data and is annotated with panoptic segmentations, semantic scene graphs, and downstream task labels. Further, we propose MM2SG, the first multimodal large vision-language model for scene graph generation, and through extensive experiments, demonstrate its ability to effectively leverage multimodal inputs. Together, MM-OR and MM2SG establish a new benchmark for holistic OR understanding, and open the path towards multimodal scene analysis in complex, high-stakes environments.

It also provides a readily available source of data for fast validation of experimental results and for exploratory analyses. Finally, it is a shared resource that can be used to foster large-scale collaborations in sleep studies.

MASS is composed of cohorts themselves comprising subsets. Recordings within subsets is kept as homogeneous as possible, whereas it is more heterogeneous between subsets. To allow inter-study comparisons, researchers validating their results on MASS are encouraged to specify which portion of the database they used in their assessment (e.g., MASS-C1 for the whole cohort 1, MASS-C1/SS1-SS3 for subsets 1, 2 and 3 of cohort 1).

Currently, the first MASS cohort available is described in O’Reilly, C., et al. (2014) J Seep Res, 23(6):628-635.

MoNuSAC,MoNuSAC Dataset,"Different types of cells play a vital role in the initiation, development, invasion, metastasis and therapeutic response of tumors of various organs.

Thus, accurate identification and segmentation of nuclei of multiple cell-types is important for AI enabled characterization of tumor and its microenvironment.

In this challenge, participants will be provided with H&E stained tissue images of four organs with annotations of multiple cell-types including epithelial cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Participants will use the annotated dataset to develop computer vision algorithms to recognize these cell-types from the tissue images of unseen patients released in the testing set of the challenge. Additionally, all cell-types will not have equal number of annotated instances in the training dataset which will encourage participants to develop algorithms for learning from imbalanced classes in a few shot learning paradigm. 

H&E staining of human tissue sections is a routine and most common protocol used by pathologists to enhance the contrast of tissue sections for tumor assessment (grading, staging, etc.) at multiple microscopic resolutions.

Morph_Call,Morph Call Dataset,"Morph Call is a suite of 46 probing tasks for four Indo-European languages that fall under different morphology: Russian, French, English, and German. The tasks are designed to explore the morphosyntactic content of multilingual transformers which is a less studied aspect at the moment.

The tasks are divided into four groups:


Morphosyntactic Features: probe the encoder for the occurrence of the morphosyntactic properties.
Masked Token: analogous to Morphosyntactic Features with the exception that the target word is replaced with a tokenizer-specific mask token.
Morphosyntactic Values: is a group of k-way classification tasks for each feature where k is the number of values that the feature can take.
Perturbations: tasks test the encoder sensitivity to syntactic and inflectional sentence perturbations.

Probing Methods

Supervised probing involves training a Logistic Regression classifier to predict a property. The performance is used as a proxy to evaluate the model knowledge.
Neuron-level Analysis [Durrani et al., 2020] allows retrieving a group of individual neurons that are most relevant to predict a linguistic property.
Contextual Correlation Analysis [Wu et al., 2020] is a representation-level similarity measure that allows identifying pairs of layers of similar behavior. 

Usage
We provide an example of the experiment on Masked Token task (Case, German).

Real spacecraft and curiosity rover anomalies for anomaly detection
Indications of telemetry anomalies can be found within previously mentioned ISA reports. All telemetry channels discussed in an individual ISA were reviewed to ensure that the anomaly was evident in the associated telemetry data, and specific anomalous time ranges were manually labeled for each channel. If multiple anomalous sequences and channels closely resembled each other, only one was kept for the experiment in order to create a diverse and balanced set. Anomalies were classified into two categories, point and contextual, to distinguish between anomalies that would likely be identified by properly set alarms or distance-based methods that ignore temporal information (point anomalies) and those that require more complex methodologies such as LSTMs or Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) approaches to detect (contextual anomalies)

MSP-IMPROV,MSP-IMPROV Dataset,"We present the MSP-IMPROV corpus, a multimodal emotional database, where the goal is to have control over lexical content and emotion while also promoting naturalness in the recordings. Studies on emotion perception often require stimuli with fixed lexical content, but that convey different emotions. These stimuli can also serve as an instrument to understand how emotion modulates speech at the phoneme level, in a manner that controls for coarticulation. Such audiovisual data are not easily available from natural recordings. A common solution is to record actors reading sentences that portray different emotions, which may not produce natural behaviors. We propose an alternative approach in which we define hypothetical scenarios for each sentence that are carefully designed to elicit a particular emotion. Two actors improvise these emotion-specific situations, leading them to utter contextualized, non-read renditions of sentences that have fixed lexical content and convey different emotions. We describe the context in which this corpus was recorded, the key features of the corpus, the areas in which this corpus can be useful, and the emotional content of the recordings. The paper also provides the performance for speech and facial emotion classifiers. The analysis brings novel classification evaluations where we study the performance in terms of inter-evaluator agreement and naturalness perception, leveraging the large size of the audiovisual database.",https://ecs.utdallas.edu/research/researchlabs/msp-lab/MSP-Improv.html,EditAcademic License,"Audio, Image",,,Academic License,https://ecs.utdallas.edu/research/researchlabs/msp-lab/publications/AcademicLicense-MSP-IMPROV.pdf,,,,"Emotion Classification, Dominance Estimation, Speech Emotion Recognition, Emotion Recognition, Arousal Estimation, Valence Estimation","speech-emotion-recognition-on-msp-improv, arousal-estimation-on-msp-improv",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/msp-improv,Computer Vision,Emotion Classification,Emotion Classification

MultiQ,MultiQ Dataset,"MultiQ is a multi-hop QA dataset for Russian, suitable for general open-domain question answering, information retrieval, and reading comprehension tasks.

Motivation

Question-answering has been an essential task in natural language processing and information retrieval. However, certain areas in QA remain quite challenging for modern approaches, including the multi-hop one, which is traditionally considered an intersection of graph methods, knowledge representation, and SOTA language modeling.

Multi-hop reasoning has been the least addressed QA direction for Russian. The task is represented by the MuSeRC dataset (Fenogenova et al., 2020) and only a few dozen questions in SberQUAD (Efimov et al., 2020) and RuBQ (Rybin et al., 2021). In response, we have developed a semi-automatic pipeline for multi-hop dataset generation based on Wikidata.

An example in English for illustration purposes:

```{

raw data: includes the original data with no additional sampling
 - episodes: data is split into evaluation episodes and includes several perturbations of test for robustness evaluation Test and train data sets are disjoint with respect to individual  - questions, but may include overlaps in support and main texts.

Test Perturbations

Each training episode in the dataset corresponds to seven test variations, including the original test data and six adversarial test sets, acquired through the modification of the original test through the following text perturbations:


ButterFingers: randomly adds noise to data by mimicking spelling mistakes made by humans through character swaps based on their keyboard distance
Emojify: replaces the input words with the corresponding emojis, preserving their original meaning
EDAdelete: randomly deletes tokens in the text
EDAswap: randomly swaps tokens in the text
BackTranslation: generates variations of the context through back-translation (ru -> en -> ru)

The existing action detection benchmarks are limited in aspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or low-level atomic actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset of spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first analyze the important ingredients of constructing a realistic and challenging dataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three criteria: (1) multi-person scenes and motion dependent identification, (2) with well-defined boundaries, (3) relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. Based on these guidelines, we build the dataset of MultiSports v1.0 by selecting 4 sports classes, collecting 3200 video clips, and annotating 37701 action instances with 902k bounding boxes. Our dataset is characterized with important properties of high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. Our MultiSports, with its realistic setting and detailed annotations, exposes the intrinsic challenges of spatio-temporal action detection.

It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and texture categories. Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects.

There are two common metrics: Detection AUROC and Segmentation (or pixelwise) AUROC

Detection (or, classification) methods output single float (anomaly score) per input test image. 

Segmentation methods output anomaly probability for each pixel. 
""To assess segmentation performance, we evaluate the relative per-region overlap of the segmentation with the ground truth. To get an additional performance measure that is independent of the determined threshold, we compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). We define the true positive rate as the percentage of pixels that were correctly classified as anomalous"" [1]
Later segmentation metric was improved to balance regions with small and large area, see PRO-AUC and other in [2]

Myket_Android_Application_Install,Myket Android Application Install Dataset,"This dataset contains information on application install interactions of users in the Myket android application market. The dataset was created for the purpose of evaluating interaction prediction models, requiring user and item identifiers along with timestamps of the interactions. Hence, the dataset can be used for interaction prediction and building a recommendation system. Furthermore, the data forms a dynamic network of interactions, and we can also perform network representation learning on the nodes in the network, which are users and applications.

Data Creation
The dataset was initially generated by the Myket data team, and later cleaned and subsampled by Erfan Loghmani a master student at Sharif University of Technology at the time. The data team focused on a two-week period and randomly sampled 1/3 of the users with interactions during that period. They then selected install and update interactions for three months before and after the two-week period, resulting in interactions spanning about 6 months and two weeks.

We further subsampled and cleaned the data to focus on application download interactions. We identified the top 8000 most installed applications and selected interactions related to them. We retained users with more than 32 interactions, resulting in 280,391 users. From this group, we randomly selected 10,000 users, and the data was filtered to include only interactions for these users. The detailed procedure can be found in here.

Data Structure
The dataset has two main files.


myket.csv: This file contains the interaction information and follows the same format as the datasets used in the ""JODIE: Predicting Dynamic Embedding Trajectory in Temporal Interaction Networks"" (ACM SIGKDD 2019) project. However, this data does not contain state labels and interaction features, resulting in associated columns being all zero.
app_info_sample.csv: This file comprises features associated with applications present in the sample. For each individual application, information such as the approximate number of installs, average rating, count of ratings, and category are included. These features provide insights into the applications present in the dataset.

Dataset Details

Total Instances: 694,121 install interaction instances
Instances Format: Triplets of user_id, app_name, timestamp
10,000 users and 7,988 android applications
Item features for 7,606 applications

For a detailed summary of the data's statistics, including information on users, applications, and interactions, please refer to the Python notebook available at summary-stats.ipynb. The notebook provides an overview of the dataset's characteristics and can be helpful for understanding the data's structure before using it for research or analysis.

| Reddit          | 10,000 | 984             | 672,447       | 67.2                          | 7.9                           |
| Wikipedia       | 8,227            | 1,000           | 157,474       | 19.1                          | 2.2                           |
| MOOC            | 7,047            | 97              | 411,749       | 58.4                          | 25.3                          |

The Myket dataset stands out by having an ample number of both users and items, highlighting its relevance for real-world, large-scale applications. Unlike LastFM, Reddit, and Wikipedia datasets, where users exhibit repetitive item interactions, the Myket dataset contains a comparatively lower amount of repetitive interactions. This unique characteristic reflects the diverse nature of user behaviors in the Android application market environment.

NEMO-Corpus,NEMO-Corpus Dataset,"Named Entity (NER) annotations of the Hebrew Treebank (Haaretz newspaper) corpus, including: morpheme and token level NER labels, nested mentions, and more.
We publish the NEMO corpus in the TACL paper ""Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO^2)"" [1], where we use it in extensive experiments and analyses, showing the importance of morphological boundaries for neural modeling of NER in morphologically rich languages. Code for these models and experiments can be found in the NEMO code repo.

Main features:

Morpheme, token-single and token-multi sequence labels. Morpheme labels provide exact boundaries, token-multi provide partial sub-word morphological but no exact boundaries, token-single provides only token-level information. 
All annotations are in BIOSE format (B=Begin, I=Inside, O=Outside, S=Singleton, E=End).
Widely-used OntoNotes entity category set: GPE (geo-political entity), PER (person), LOC (location), ORG (organization), FAC (facility), EVE (event), WOA (work-of-art), ANG (language), DUC (product).
NEMO includes NER annotations for the two major versions of the Hebrew Treebank, UD (Universal Dependency) and SPMRL. These can be aligned to the other morphosyntactic information layers of the treebank using bclm
We provide nested mentions. Only the first, widest, layer is used in the NEMO^2 paper. We invite you to take on this challenge!
Guidelines used for annotation are provided here.
Corpus was annotated by two native Hebrew speakers of academic education, and curated by the project manager. We provide the original annotations made by the annotators as well to promote work on learning with disagreements.
Annotation was performed using WebAnno (version 3.4.5)

    abstract = ""{Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental NLP task, commonly formulated as classification over a sequence of tokens. Morphologically rich languages (MRLs) pose a challenge to this basic formulation, as the boundaries of named entities do not necessarily coincide with token boundaries, rather, they respect morphological boundaries. To address NER in MRLs we then need to answer two fundamental questions, namely, what are the basic units to be labeled, and how can these units be detected and classified in realistic settings (i.e., where no gold morphology is available). We empirically investigate these questions on a novel NER benchmark, with parallel token- level and morpheme-level NER annotations, which we develop for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically rich-and-ambiguous language. Our results show that explicitly modeling morphological boundaries leads to improved NER performance, and that a novel hybrid architecture, in which NER precedes and prunes morphological decomposition, greatly outperforms the standard pipeline, where morphological decomposition strictly precedes NER, setting a new performance bar for both Hebrew NER and Hebrew morphological decomposition tasks.}"",

NeoRL-2,NeoRL-2 Dataset,"NeoRL-2 includes new task scenarios that better reflect real-world task properties and includes traditional control methods as the data-collecting method. In summary, our contributions are as follows:



Tasks in NeoRL-2 cover a wider range of application domains, including robotics, aircraft, industrial pipelines, controllable nuclear fusion, healthcare, etc., encompassing key features such as delays, external factors, and safety constraints.



The data-collecting method in NeoRL-2 better aligns with real-world scenarios, employing deterministic methods for sampling. In some specific tasks, classical feedback controllers, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, are introduced.



We conducted experiments on these tasks using state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline RL algorithms and found that in most tasks, the trained policy of the current offline RL algorithms did not significantly outperform the behavior policy.



By extending near real-world tasks in NeoRL-2, we hope that the development and implementation of RL in real-world scenarios can take into account these challenges and tackle more realistic domains.",https://github.com/polixir/NeoRL2,EditCC BY 4.0,,,,,,,,,Offline RL,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/neorl2,Methodology,Offline RL,Offline RL

NERDS_360,NERDS 360 Dataset,"We present a large-scale dataset for 3D urban scene understanding. Compared to existing datasets, our dataset consists of 75 outdoor urban scenes with diverse backgrounds, encompassing over 15,000 images. These scenes offer 360◦ hemispherical views, capturing diverse foreground objects illuminated under various lighting conditions. Additionally, our dataset encompasses scenes that are not limited to forward-driving views, addressing the limitations of previous datasets such as limited overlap and coverage between camera
views. The closest pre-existing dataset for generalizable evaluation is DTU [2] (80 scenes) which comprises mostly indoor objects and does not provide multiple foreground objects or background scenes.

We use the Parallel Domain synthetic data generation to render high-fidelity 360◦ scenes. We select 3 different maps i.e. SF 6thAndMission, SF GrantAndCalifornia and SF VanNessAveAndTurkSt and sample 75 different scenes across all 3 maps as our backgrounds (All 75 scenes across 3 maps are significantly different road scenes from each other, captured at different viewpoints in the city). We select 20 different cars in 50 different textures for training and randomly sample from 1 to 4 cars to render in a scene. We refer to this dataset as NeRDS 360: NeRF for Reconstruction, Decomposition and Scene Synthesis of 360◦ outdoor scenes. In total, we generate 15k renderings by sampling 200 cameras in a 
 hemispherical dome at a fixed distance from the center of cars. We held out 5 scenes with 4 different cars and different backgrounds for testing, comprising 100 cameras distributed uniformly sampled in the upper hemisphere, different from the camera distributions used for training. We use the diverse validation camera distribution to test our approach’s ability to generalize to unseen viewpoints as well as unseen scenes during training. Our dataset and the corresponding task is extremely challenging due to occlusions, diversity of backgrounds, and rendered objects with various lightning and shadows. 

Our task entails reconstructing 360◦ hemispherical views of complete scenes using a handful of observations i.e. 1 to 5 as shown by red cameras whereas evaluating using all 100 hemispherical views, hence our task requires strong priors for novel view synthesis of outdoor scenes.

Niko_Chord_Progression_Dataset,Niko Chord Progression Dataset Dataset,"Introduction
The Niko Chord Progression Dataset is used in AccoMontage2. It contains 5k+ chord progression pieces, labeled with styles. There are four styles in total: Pop Standard, Pop Complex, Dark and R&B. Some progressions have an 'Unknown' style. Some statistics are provided below.

|                            | Mean  | Variance |
| -------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Note Pitch                 | 57    | 167.70   |
| Note Velocity              | 79.05 | 457.89   |
| Note Duration (in seconds) | 1.38  | 1.62     |

Data Formats
You can access the Niko Chord Progression Dataset in two formats: MIDI format and the quantized note matrix format. 

MIDI (dataset.zip)
Each chord progression piece is stored as a single MIDI file.

Quantized Note Matrix (dataset.pkl)
A python dictionary with format like the following. nmatis an 2-d matrix, each row represent a quantized note: [start, end, pitch, velocity]. <u>Each note is quantized at the eighth note level. eg., start=2 means the note begins at the third eighth note.</u> root is also an 2-d matrix. It labels the roots of the chords using an eighth note sample rate. Each row of the root represents a bar. Each element is an integer ranged from 0 (C note) to 11 (B note).

```python
{'piece name': 
    {'nmat': [[0, 3, 60, 60], ...],    # 2-d matrix: note matrix
     'root': [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], ...], # 2-d matrix: root label
     'style': 'some style',            # pop_standard, pop_complex, dark, r&b, unknown
     'mode': 'some mode',              # M, m
     'tonic': 'some tonic'             # C, Db, ... B
    }, 
 ...
}

load the dataset using pickle

    dataset = pickle.load(file)
```

Supplementary description
Original Dataset
The Niko Chord Progression Dataset is a re-organized version of the original Niko Dataset. The original Niko Dataset have duplicate progressions and unnecessary labels, it was thus processed and converted to this version.

Style Mapping
The style label was mapped from the original dataset to the new dataset. The style label in the original dataset is stored as folder names, and thus the style can be obtained from the file path. The following shows a detailed description of the style mapping function.

Ninapro_DB5,Ninapro DB5 Dataset,"The 5th Ninapro database includes 10 intact subjects recorded with two Thalmic Myo (https://www.myo.com/) armbands.
The database can be used to test the Myo armbands separately as well.
The 5th Ninapro database is thoroughly described in the paper: ""Stefano Pizzolato, Luca Tagliapietra, Matteo Cognolato, Monica Reggiani, Henning Müller, Manfredo Atzori, Comparison of six electromyography acquisition setups on hand movement classification tasks, PLOS One, 2017""

Acquisition Protocol
The subjects have to repeat several movements represented by movies that are shown on the screen of a laptop.
The experiment is divided in three exercises:


Basic movements of the fingers
Isometric, isotonic hand configurations and basic wrist movements
Grasping and functional movements

During the acquisition, the subjects were asked to repeat the movements with the right hand. Each movement repetition lasted 5 seconds and was followed by 3 seconds of rest.
The protocol includes 6 repetitions of 52 different movements (plus rest) performed by 10 intact subjects. The movements were selected from the hand taxonomy as well as from hand robotics literature.

Acquisition Setup
The muscular activity is gathered using 2 Thalmic Myo armbands. The database can be used to test the Myo armbands separately as well.
The subjects in this database wore two Myo armbands one next to the other, including 16 active single–differential wireless electrodes. The top Myo armband is placed closed to the elbow with the first sensor placed on the radio humeral joint, as in the standard Ninapro configuration for the equally spaced electrodes; the second Myo armband is placed just after the first, nearer to the hand, tilted of 22.5 degrees. This configuration provides an extended uniform muscle mapping at an extremely affordable cost. The Myo sensors do not require the arm to be shaved and after few minutes the armband tighten very firmly to the arm of the subject.
The sEMG signals are sampled at a rate of 200 Hz.",http://ninapro.hevs.ch/DB5_DoubleMyo,EditCreative Commons Attribution No Derivatives 4.0 International,Image,,2017,,,,,,EMG Gesture Recognition,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ninapro-db5,Computer Vision,EMG Gesture Recognition,EMG Gesture Recognition
NINCO,NINCO Dataset,"The NINCO (No ImageNet Class Objects) dataset is introduced in the ICML 2023 paper In or Out? Fixing ImageNet Out-of-Distribution Detection Evaluation. The images in this dataset are free from objects that belong to any of the 1000 classes of ImageNet-1K (ILSVRC2012), which makes NINCO suitable for evaluating out-of-distribution detection on ImageNet-1K .

The NINCO main dataset consists of 64 OOD classes with a total of 5879 samples. These OOD classes were selected to have no categorical overlap with any classes of ImageNet-1K. Each sample was inspected individually by the authors to not contain ID objects.

Besides NINCO, included are (in the same .tar.gz file) truly OOD versions of 11 popular OOD datasets with in total 2715 OOD samples.

Further included are 17 OOD unit-tests, with 400 samples each.

OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1)
Dataset Description

Homepage: https://www.open-assistant.io/
Repository: https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07327

Dataset Summary
In an effort to democratize research on large-scale alignment, we release OpenAssistant 
Conversations (OASST1), a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation 
corpus consisting of 161,443 messages in 35 different languages, annotated with 461,292 
quality ratings, resulting in over 10,000 fully annotated conversation trees. The corpus 
is a product of a worldwide crowd-sourcing effort involving over 13,500 volunteers.

Please refer to our paper for further details.

Dataset Structure
This dataset contains message trees. Each message tree has an initial prompt message as the root node, 
which can have multiple child messages as replies, and these child messages can have multiple replies. 

All messages have a role property: this can either be ""assistant"" or ""prompter"". The roles in 
conversation threads from prompt to leaf node strictly alternate between ""prompter"" and ""assistant"".

This version of the dataset contains data collected on the open-assistant.io website until April 12 2023.

JSON Example: Message
For readability, the following JSON examples are shown formatted with indentation on multiple lines.
Objects are stored without indentation (on single lines) in the actual jsonl files.

Please refer to oasst-data for
details about the data structure and Python code to read and write jsonl files containing oasst data objects.

If you would like to explore the dataset yourself you can find a 
getting-started 
notebook in the notebooks/openassistant-oasst1 folder of the LAION-AI/Open-Assistant
github repository.

Main Dataset Files
Conversation data is provided either as nested messages in trees (extension .trees.jsonl.gz) 
or as a flat list (table) of messages (extension .messages.jsonl.gz).

Ready For Export Trees
2023-04-12_oasst_ready.trees.jsonl.gz       10,364 trees with 88,838 total messages
2023-04-12_oasst_ready.messages.jsonl.gz    88,838 messages
Trees in ready_for_export state without spam and deleted messages including message labels.
The oasst_ready-trees file usually is sufficient for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) & reward model (RM) training.

All Trees
2023-04-12_oasst_all.trees.jsonl.gz         66,497 trees with 161,443 total messages
2023-04-12_oasst_all.messages.jsonl.gz     161,443 messages
All trees, including those in states prompt_lottery_waiting (trees that consist of only one message, namely the initial prompt),
aborted_low_grade (trees that stopped growing because the messages had low quality), and halted_by_moderator.

Supplemental Exports: Spam & Prompts
2023-04-12_oasst_spam.messages.jsonl.gz
These are messages which were deleted or have a negative review result (""review_result"": false).
Besides low quality, a frequent reason for message deletion is a wrong language tag.

2023-04-12_oasst_prompts.messages.jsonl.gz
These are all the kept initial prompt messages with positive review result (no spam) of trees in ready_for_export or prompt_lottery_waiting state.

Using the Huggingface Datasets
While HF datasets is ideal for tabular datasets, it is not a natural fit for nested data structures like the OpenAssistant conversation trees.
Nevertheless, we make all messages which can also be found in the file 2023-04-12_oasst_ready.trees.jsonl.gz available in parquet as train/validation splits. 
These are directly loadable by Huggingface Datasets.

To load the oasst1 train & validation splits use:

python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset(""OpenAssistant/oasst1"")
train = ds['train']      # len(train)=84437 (95%)
val = ds['validation']   # len(val)=4401 (5%)

The messages appear in depth-first order of the message trees.

Full conversation trees can be reconstructed from the flat messages table by using the parent_id 
and message_id properties to identify the parent-child relationship of messages. The message_tree_id 
and tree_state properties (only present in flat messages files) can be used to find all messages of a message tree or to select trees by their state.

Languages
OpenAssistant Conversations incorporates 35 different languages with a distribution of messages as follows:

Task 1 (Groupings) is evaluated via six metrics: number of solved walls, number of correct groups (max. four per wall), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Fowlkes Mallows Score (FMS), and Wasserstein Distance (WD), normalized to (0, 1) range, between predicted and ground-truth labels.

Task 2 (Connections) is evaluated with three metrics: exact string matching, ROUGE-1 F1, and BERTScore F1.

Baseline results with pre-trained language models and with few-shot In-context Learning (ICL) with LLMs such as GPT-4 are available here:

ODAQ contains 240 audio samples and corresponding quality scores. Each audio sample is rated by 26 listeners. The audio samples are stereo audio signals sampled at 44.1 or 48 kHz and are processed by a total of 6 method classes, each operating at different quality levels. The processing method classes are designed to generate quality degradations possibly encountered during audio coding and source separation, and the quality levels for each method class span the entire quality range. The diversity of the processing methods, the large span of quality levels, the high sampling frequency, and the pool of international listeners make ODAQ particularly suited for further research into subjective and objective audio quality.

ODDS,ODDS Dataset,"Outliers or anomalies are instances that do not conform to the norm of a dataset. Outlier detection is an important data mining problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and applications domains such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, unusual event detection, disease condition detection etc.

The exact notion of an outlier is different for different application domains. Hence, applying a technique developed for one domain to another is not straightforward. Moreover, availability of labeled data for training/validation of outlier detection methods is scarce and often noise contained in data tends to be similar to outliers, thus makes it difficult to distinguish them. Because of these challenges outlier detection is not an easy problem to solve. Furthermore, research on outlier detection has been held back by the lack of good benchmark datasets with ground truths. Existing benchmarks are typically either proprietary or else very artificial. Moreover, existing real-world outlier/anomaly detection datasets lack the availability of ground truth.

In ODDS, we openly provide access to a large collection of outlier detection datasets with ground truth (if available). Our focus is to provide datasets from different domains and present them under a single platform for the research community. As such, we arrange the datasets based on their types into different tables in ODDS library.

The ODDS library is being actively developed since summer 2016 and is growing as a result of our research pursuits in outlier/anomaly mining and also to help the corresponding research community. Researchers are welcome to share their datasets with us to include in ODDS library by emailing srayana@cs.stonybrook.edu.",http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/,EditUnknown,"Image, Time Series",,2016,,,,,,"Anomaly Detection, Time Series Anomaly Detection",anomaly-detection-on-odds,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/odds,Computer Vision,Anomaly Detection,Anomaly Detection

OLIVES_Dataset,OLIVES Dataset Dataset,"Clinical diagnosis of the eye is performed over multifarious data modalities including scalar clinical labels, vectorized biomarkers, two-dimensional fundus images, and three-dimensional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. While the clinical labels, fundus images and OCT scans are instrumental measurements, the vectorized biomarkers are interpreted attributes from the other measurements. Clinical practitioners use all these data modalities for diagnosing and treating eye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). Enabling usage of machine learning algorithms within the ophthalmic medical domain requires research into the relationships and interactions between these relevant data modalities. Existing datasets are limited in that: (i) they view the problem as disease prediction without assessing biomarkers, and (ii) they do not consider the explicit relationship among all four data modalities over the treatment period. In this paper, we introduce the Ophthalmic Labels for Investigating Visual Eye Semantics (OLIVES) dataset that addresses the above limitations. This is the first OCT and fundus dataset that includes clinical labels, biomarker labels, and time-series patient treatment information from associated clinical trials. The dataset consists of 1268 fundus eye images each with 49 OCT scans, and 16 biomarkers, along with 3 clinical labels and a disease diagnosis of DR or DME. In total, there are 96 eyes' data averaged over a period of at least two years with each eye treated for an average of 66 weeks and 7 injections.

OpenStreetView-5M,OpenStreetView-5M Dataset,"OpenStreetView-5M establishes a new open benchmark for geolocation by providing a large, open, and clean dataset. As detailed below, OpenStreetView-5M improves upon several limitations of current geolocation datasets.

Deep neural networks have historically been selected over other machine learning methods because they benefit from larger amounts of data. OSV-5M consists of 4,894,685 training and 210,122 test images, with a height of $512$ pixels and an average width of $792\pm127$  pixels.

Many geolocation datasets are restricted to a few cities or are significantly biased towards the Western world . In contrast, OpenStreetView-5M images are uniformly sampled on the globe, covering 70k cities and 225 countries and territories. The distribution of test images across countries has a normalized entropy of $0.78$~\cite[Eq. 19]{wilcox1967indices}, suggesting high diversity. Our train set has a normalized entropy of $0.67$, which is comparable to the entropy of the distribution of the countries' area ($0.71$).

OpenStreetView-5M is based on the crowd-sourced street view images of Mapillary  which follow the CC-BY-SA license: free of use with attribution.

We estimate through manual inspection of 4500 images that 96.1\% (±0.57\%) of the images in the OpenStreetView-5M dataset are localizable, with a 95\% confidence level. Among the weakly or non-localizable images, $70$\% ($2.7$\% total) are low-quality: under- or over-exposed, blurry, or rotated; $30$\% ($1.2$\% total) are poorly framed, indoor, or in tunnels.

Without carefully enforcing the spatial separation between train and test images, geolocation can reduce to place-recognition. As our goal is to assess the capacity of models to learn robust geographical representations, we ensure that no image in the OSV-5M training set lies within a $1$km radius of any image in the test set.

Street-view images are typically acquired by a limited number of camera sensors mounted on the top or front of a small fleet of vehicles assigned to a given region. This correlation between location, cars, and sensors can be exploited to simplify the geolocation task. Notoriously, players of the web-based geolocation game GeoGuessr  can locate images from Ghana by spotting a piece of duct tape placed on the corner of the roof rack of the Google Street View car . OpenStreetView-5M tries to avoid this pitfall by ensuring that no image sequence (a continuous series of images acquired by the same user) appears in both training and test sets. While this might not prevent images taken with the same vehicle on different days from being in both sets, it limits such occurrences.

Rich metadata beyond geographical coordinates can improve the robustness and versatility of geolocation models. Each image in our dataset is associated with four tiers of administrative data: country, region (\eg, state), area (\eg, county), and the nearest city. Note that areas are not defined for one-third of the dataset.

We also associate each image with a set of additional information: land cover, climate, soil type, the driving side, and distance to the sea where the image was taken.",https://huggingface.co/datasets/osv5m/osv5m,EditCC-BY-SA,,,,,,5M images,"training and 210,122 test images",,Photo geolocation estimation,photo-geolocation-estimation-on,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/openstreetview-5m,Methodology,Photo geolocation estimation,Photo geolocation estimation

Existing open-vocabulary tasks focus on object classes, whereas research on object attributes is limited due to the lack of a reliable attribute-focused evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces the Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection (OVAD) task and the corresponding OVAD benchmark. The objective of the novel task and benchmark is to probe object-level attribute information learned by vision-language models. To this end, we created a clean and densely annotated test set covering 117 attribute classes on the 80 object classes of MS COCO. It includes positive and negative annotations, which enables open-vocabulary evaluation. Overall, the benchmark consists of 1.4 million annotations. For reference, we provide a first baseline method for open-vocabulary attribute detection. Moreover, we demonstrate the benchmark's value by studying the attribute detection performance of several foundation models.",https://ovad-benchmark.github.io/,EditCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License,"Image, Text",English,,Open-vocabulary Attribute Detection,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12914v1.pdf,,,,"Language Modelling, Open Vocabulary Object Detection, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Open Vocabulary Attribute Detection","open-vocabulary-attribute-detection-on-ovad-1, visual-question-answering-vqa-on-ovad, open-vocabulary-attribute-detection-on-ovad",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ovad-benchmark,Computer Vision,Language Modelling,Language Modelling
OVIC_Datasets,OVIC Datasets Dataset,"Due to the free-form nature of the open vocabulary image classification task, special annotations are required for image sets used for evaluation purposes. Three such image datasets are presented here:


World: 272 images of which the grand majority are originally sourced (have never been on the internet) from 10 countries by 12 people, with an active focus on covering as wide and varied concepts as possible, including unusual, deceptive and/or indirect representations of objects,
Wiki: 1000 Wikipedia lead images sampled from a scraped pool of 18K,
Val3K: 3000 images from the ImageNet-1K validation set, sampled uniformly across the classes.

It is not in general possible to exhaustively annotate ground truth classification labels for open vocabulary image sets, as this would require annotations for every possible correct object noun in the English language for every visible entity in every part of every image. It is possible however, to annotate the thousands of predictions that have been made across the image sets by open vocabulary models trained thus far. All three image datasets presented here have been individually annotated by both human and multimodal LLM annotators for the object nouns that were predicted by trained models. The annotations specify whether each classification is correct, close, or incorrect, and for the human annotations, whether it relates to a primary or secondary element of the image. It is customary to use the suffixes -H and -L to clearly specify which annotations are being referred to at any time, e.g. Wiki-H is the Wiki dataset with corresponding human annotations. All three datasets together contain a total of 17.4K human and 112K LLM class annotations.

Paderbone_University_Bearing_Fault_Benckmark,Paderbone University Bearing Fault Benckmark Dataset,"This paper presents a benchmark data set for condition monitoring of rolling bearings in combination with an extensive description of the corresponding bearing damage, the data set generation by experiments and results of datadriven classifications used as a diagnostic method. The diagnostic method uses the motor current signal of an electromechanical drive system for bearing diagnostic. The advantage of this approach in general is that no additional sensors are required, as current measurements can be performed in existing frequency inverters. This will help to reduce the cost of future condition monitoring systems. A particular novelty of the present approach is the monitoring of damage in external bearings which are installed in the drive system but outside the electric motor. Nevertheless, the motor current signal is used as input for the detection of the damage. Moreover, a wide distribution of bearing damage is considered for the benchmark data set. The results of the classifications show that the motor current signal can be used to identify and classify bearing damage within the drive system. However, the classification accuracy is still low compared to classifications based on vibration signals. Further, dependency on properties of those bearing damage that were used for the generation of training data are observed, because training with data of artificially generated and real bearing damages lead to different accuracies. Altogether a verified and systematically generated data set is presented and published online for further research",https://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2015/phmec_16_003.pdf,EditUnknown,"Image, Time Series",,,Homepage,https://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2015/phmec_16_003.pdf,,,,"Fault localization, Time Series Analysis, Time Series Anomaly Detection, Fault Detection",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/paderbone-university-bearing-fault-benckmark,Computer Vision,Fault localization,Fault localization

PBC,PBC Dataset,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. Progression is slow but inexhortable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver decompensation. The condition has been recognised since at least 1851 and was named ""primary biliary cirrhosis"" in 1949. Because cirrhosis is a feature only of advanced disease, a change of its name to ""primary biliary cholangitis"" was proposed by patient advocacy groups in 2014.

This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival. Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.

PCFG_SET,PCFG SET Dataset,"The Probabilistic Context Free Grammar String Edit Task (PCFG SET) dataset is a dataset with sequence to sequence problems specifically designed to test different aspects of compositional generalisation. In particular, the dataset contains splits to test for systematicity, productivity, substitutivity, localism and overgeneralisation.

The input alphabet of PCFG SET contains three types of words: words for unary and binary functions that represent \emph{string edit operations} (e.g. $\texttt{append}, \texttt{copy}, \texttt{reverse})$, elements to form the string sequences that these functions can be applied to (e.g. $\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{A1}, \texttt{B1}$), and a separator to separate the arguments of a binary function ($\texttt{,}$). The input sequences that are formed with this alphabet are sequences describing how a series of such operations are to be applied to a string argument. For instance:


$\texttt{repeat A B C }$ 
$\texttt{echo remove_first D K , E F}$ 
$\texttt{append swap F G H , repeat I J}$ 

The input sequences are generated with a PCFG, whose production probabilities are learned with EM to match the depth and length distributions in a corpus with English sentences.

The output of a PCFG SET sequence, representing its meaning, is constructed by recursively applying the string edit operations specified in the sequence. For instance: 


$\texttt{repeat A B C }$  &  $\rightarrow$  &  $\texttt{A B C A B C}$ 
$\texttt{echo remove_first D K , E F}$  & $\rightarrow$ & $\texttt{E F F}$
$\texttt{append swap F G H , repeat I J}$  & $\rightarrow$ & $\texttt{H G F I J I J }$

The string alphabet used for the construction of the dataset has 520 distinct elements, the length of the string arguments to a functions is limited to 5.The dataset contains around 100 thousand examples in total.

PeopleSansPeople,PeopleSansPeople Dataset,"In recent years, person detection and human pose estimation have made great strides, helped by large-scale labeled datasets. However, these datasets had no guarantees or analysis of human activities, poses, or context diversity. Additionally, privacy, legal, safety, and ethical concerns may limit the ability to collect more human data. An emerging alternative to real-world data that alleviates some of these issues is synthetic data. However, creation of synthetic data generators is incredibly challenging and prevents researchers from exploring their usefulness. Therefore, we release a human-centric synthetic data generator PeopleSansPeople which contains simulation-ready 3D human assets, a parameterized lighting and camera system, and generates 2D and 3D bounding box, instance and semantic segmentation, and COCO pose labels. Using PeopleSansPeople, we performed benchmark synthetic data training using a Detectron2 Keypoint R-CNN variant [1]. We found that pre-training a network using synthetic data and fine-tuning on target real-world data (few-shot transfer to limited subsets of COCO-person train [2]) resulted in a keypoint AP of 60.37±0.48 (COCO test-dev2017) outperforming models trained with the same real data alone (keypoint AP of 55.80) and pre-trained with ImageNet (keypoint AP of 57.50).

The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e., task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with inaccurate context (PhD-iac) or with incorrect context (PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, inaccurate / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.",https://github.com/jiazhen-code/PhD,EditUnknown,,,,,,,"valuation (VHE).

The data were partitioned into balanced training (n = 994), and test sets (n = 989).

The sleep stages of the subjects were annotated by clinical staff at the MGH according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual for the scoring of sleep. More specifically, the following six sleep stages were annotated in 30 second contiguous intervals: wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, rapid eye movement (REM), and undefined.

Certified sleep technologists at the MGH also annotated waveforms for the presence of arousals that interrupted the sleep of the subjects. The annotated arousals were classified as either: spontaneous arousals, respiratory effort related arousals (RERA), bruxisms, hypoventilations, hypopneas, apneas (central, obstructive and mixed), vocalizations, snores, periodic leg movements, Cheyne-Stokes breathing or partial airway obstructions.

The subjects had a variety of physiological signals recorded as they slept through the night including: electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG), and oxygen saturation (SaO2). Excluding SaO2, all signals were sampled to 200 Hz and were measured in microvolts.

The data for this Challenge are from multiple sources:
CPSC Database and CPSC-Extra Database
INCART Database
PTB and PTB-XL Database
The Georgia 12-lead ECG Challenge (G12EC) Database
Undisclosed Database
The first source is the public (CPSC Database) and unused data (CPSC-Extra Database) from the China Physiological Signal Challenge in 2018 (CPSC2018), held during the 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology in Nanjing, China. The unused data from the CPSC2018 is NOT the test data from the CPSC2018. The test data of the CPSC2018 is included in the final private database that has been sequestered. This training set consists of two sets of 6,877 (male: 3,699; female: 3,178) and 3,453 (male: 1,843; female: 1,610) of 12-ECG recordings lasting from 6 seconds to 60 seconds. Each recording was sampled at 500 Hz.

The second source set is the public dataset from St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. This database consists of 74 annotated recordings extracted from 32 Holter records. Each record is 30 minutes long and contains 12 standard leads, each sampled at 257 Hz.

The third source from the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) comprises two public databases: the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and the PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset. The first PTB database contains 516 records (male: 377, female: 139). Each recording was sampled at 1000 Hz. The PTB-XL contains 21,837 clinical 12-lead ECGs (male: 11,379 and female: 10,458) of 10 second length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.

The fourth source is a Georgia database which represents a unique demographic of the Southeastern United States. This training set contains 10,344 12-lead ECGs (male: 5,551, female: 4,793) of 10 second length with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.

The fifth source is an undisclosed American database that is geographically distinct from the Georgia database. This source contains 10,000 ECGs (all retained as test data).

All data is provided in WFDB format. Each ECG recording has a binary MATLAB v4 file (see page 27) for the ECG signal data and a text file in WFDB header format describing the recording and patient attributes, including the diagnosis (the labels for the recording). The binary files can be read using the load function in MATLAB and the scipy.io.loadmat function in Python; please see our baseline models for examples of loading the data. The first line of the header provides information about the total number of leads and the total number of samples or points per lead. The following lines describe how each lead was saved, and the last lines provide information on demographics and diagnosis. Below is an example header file A0001.hea:

Data Sources
The Challenge data include recordings from last year’s Challenge and many new recordings for this year’s Challenge:


CPSC Database and CPSC-Extra Database
INCART Database
PTB and PTB-XL Database
The Georgia 12-lead ECG Challenge (G12EC) Database
Augmented Undisclosed Database
Chapman-Shaoxing and Ningbo Database
The University of Michigan (UMich) Database

The Challenge data include annotated twelve-lead ECG recordings from six sources in four countries across three continents. These databases include over 100,000 twelve-lead ECG recordings with over 88,000 ECGs shared publicly as training data, 6,630 ECGs retained privately as validation data, and 36,266 ECGs retained privately as test data.



The first source is the China Physiological Signal Challenge in 2018 (CPSC 2018), which was held during the 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology in Nanjing, China. This source contains two databases: the data from CPSC 2018 (the CPSC Database) and unused data from CPSC 2018 (the CPSC-Extra Database). Together, these databases contain 13,256 ECGs (10,330 ECGs shared as training data, 1,463 retained as validation data, and 1,463 retained as test data). We shared the training set and an unused dataset from CPSC 2018 as training data, and we split the test set from CPSC 2018 into validation and test sets. Each recording is between 6 and 144 seconds long with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.



The second source is the St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. This source contains 74 annotated ECGs (all shared as training data) extracted from 32 Holter monitor recordings. Each recording is 30 minutes long with a sampling frequency of 257 Hz.



The third source is the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and includes two public datasets: the PTB and the PTB-XL databases. The source contains 22,353 ECGs (all shared as training data). Each recording is between 10 and 120 seconds long with a sampling frequency of either 500 or 1,000 Hz.



The fourth source is a Georgia database which represents a unique demographic of the Southeastern United States. This source contains 20,672 ECGs (10,344 ECGs shared as training data, 5,167 retained as validation data, and 5,161 retained as test data). Each recording is between 5 and 10 seconds long with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.



The fifth source is an undisclosed American database that is geographically distinct from the Georgia database. This source contains 10,000 ECGs (all retained as test data).



The sixth source is the Chapman University, Shaoxing People’s Hospital (Chapman-Shaoxing) and Ningbo First Hospital (Ningbo) database. This source contains 45,152 ECGS (all shared as training data). Each recording is 10 seconds long with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.



The seventh source is UMich Database from the University of Michigan. This source contains 19,642 ECGs (all retained as test data). Each recording is 10 seconds long with a sampling frequency of either 250 Hz or 500 Hz.



Like other real-world datasets, different databases may have different proportions of cardiac abnormalities, but all of the labels in the validation or test data are represented in the training data. Moreover, while this is a curated dataset, some of the data and labels are likely to have errors, and an important part of the Challenge is to work out these issues. In particular, some of the databases have human-overread machine labels with single or multiple human readers, so the quality of the labels varies between databases. You can find more information about the label mappings of the Challenge training data in this table.

The six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead validation data are reduced-lead versions of the twelve-lead validation data: the same recordings with the same header data but only with signal data for the relevant leads.

We are not planning to release the test data at any point, including after the end of the Challenge. Requests for the test data will not receive a response. We do not release test data to prevent overfitting on the test data and claims or publications of inflated performances. We will entertain requests to run code on the test data after the Challenge on a limited basis based on publication necessity and capacity. (The Challenge is largely staged by volunteers.)

Data Format
All data was formatted in WFDB format. Each ECG recording uses a binary MATLAB v4 file (see page 27) for the ECG signal data and a plain text file in WFDB header format for the recording and patient attributes, including the diagnosis, i.e., the labels for the recording. The binary files can be read using the load function in MATLAB and the scipy.io.loadmat function in Python; see our MATLAB and Python example code for working examples. The first line of the header provides information about the total number of leads and the total number of samples or time points per lead, the following lines describe how each lead was encoded, and the last lines provide information on the demographics and diagnosis of the patient.

For example, a header file A0001.hea may have the following contents:

```

PIQ23,PIQ23 Dataset,"Year after year, the demand for ever-better smartphone photos continues to grow, in particular in the domain of portrait photography. Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality assessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA process, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may degrade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, covering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23. Finally, we show through an extensive comparison with existing baselines that semantic information (image context) can be used to improve IQA predictions. The dataset along with the proposed statistical analysis and BIQA algorithms are available: https://github.com/DXOMARKResearch/PIQ2023",https://corp.dxomark.com/data-base-piq23/,"EditProvided that the User complies with the Terms of Use, the Provider grants a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access, download and use the Database for internal and research purposes only, during the specified term.

Existing synthetic datasets (FigureQA, DVQA) for reasoning over plots do not contain variability in data labels, real-valued data, or complex reasoning questions. Consequently, proposed models for these datasets do not fully address the challenge of reasoning over plots. In particular, they assume that the answer comes either from a small fixed size vocabulary or from a bounding box within the image. However, in practice this is an unrealistic assumption because many questions require reasoning and thus have real valued answers which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image.

PolyU,PolyU Dataset,"PolyU Dataset is a large dataset of real-world noisy images with reasonably obtained corresponding “ground truth” images. The basic idea is to capture the same and unchanged scene for many (e.g., 500) times and compute their mean image, which can be roughly taken as the “ground truth” image for the real-world noisy images. The rational of this strategy is that for each pixel, the noise is generated randomly larger or smaller than 0. Sampling the same pixel many times and computing the average value will approximate the truth pixel value and alleviate significantly the noise.",https://github.com/csjunxu/PolyU-Real-World-Noisy-Images-Dataset,EditUnknown,Image,,,Real-world Noisy Image Denoising: A New Benchmark,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02603.pdf,,,,"Image Denoising, Image Enhancement, Denoising",image-denoising-on-polyu-dataset,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/polyu-dataset,Computer Vision,Image Denoising,Image Denoising

PoPArt,PoPArt Dataset,"Throughout the history of art, the pose—as the holistic abstraction of the human body's expression—has proven to be a constant in numerous studies. However, due to the enormous amount of data that so far had to be processed by hand, its crucial role to the formulaic recapitulation of art-historical motifs since antiquity could only be highlighted selectively. This is true even for the now automated estimation of human poses, as domain-specific, sufficiently large data sets required for training computational models are either not publicly available or not indexed at a fine enough granularity. With the Poses of People in Art data set, we introduce the first openly licensed data set for estimating human poses in art and validating human pose estimators. It consists of 2,454 images from 22 art-historical depiction styles, including those that have increasingly turned away from lifelike representations of the body since the 19th century. A total of 10,749 human figures are precisely enclosed by rectangular bounding boxes, with a maximum of four per image labeled by up to 17 keypoints; among these are mainly joints such as elbows and knees. For machine learning purposes, the data set is divided into three subsets—training, validation, and testing—, that follow the established JSON-based Microsoft COCO format, respectively. Each image annotation, in addition to mandatory fields, provides metadata from the art-historical online encyclopedia WikiArt.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516229,EditCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,"3D, Image",,,,,454 images,"training computational models are either not publicly available or not indexed at a fine enough granularity.

PTB-XL,PTB-XL Dataset,"Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool to assess the cardiac condition of a patient. Automatic ECG interpretation algorithms as diagnosis support systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the basis of the number of ECGs that are routinely taken. However, the development of such algorithms requires large training datasets and clear benchmark procedures. In our opinion, both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by existing freely accessible ECG datasets.

The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21799 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18869 patients of 10 second length. The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements. To ensure comparability of machine learning algorithms trained on the dataset, we provide recommended splits into training and test sets.

The 1,073 full rare disease mention annotations (from 312 MIMIC-III discharge summaries) are in full_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv.

The data split:
* the first 400 rows are used for validation, validation_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv, and
* the last 673 rows are used for testing, test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_disch.csv.

The 198 rare disease mention annotations (from 145 MIMIC-III radiology reports) are in test_set_RD_ann_MIMIC_III_rad.csv. To note that radiology reports were only used for testing and not for validation.

To note: a row can only be consider a true phenotype of the patient only when the value of the column gold mention-to-ORDO label is 1.

Data sampling and annotation procedure


(i) Randomly sampled 500 discharge summaries (and 1000 radiology reports) from MIMIC-III



(ii) 312 of the 500 discharge summaries (and 145 of the 1000 radiology reports) have at least one positive UMLS mention linked to ORDO, as identified by SemEHR; there are altogether 1073 (and 198 in radiology reports) UMLS/ORDO mentions.



(iii) 3 medical informatics researchers (staff or PhD students) annotated the 1,073 mentions (and 2 medical informatics researchers annotated the 198 mentions in radiology reports), regarding whether they are the correct patient phenotypes matched to UMLS and ORDO. Contradictions in the annotations were then resolved by another research staff having biomedical background.

Note:
* These manual annotations are by no means to be perfect. There are hypothetical mentions which were difficult for the annotators to make a decision (see some notes in the raw annotations). Also, they are based on the output of SemEHR, which does not have 100% recall, so the annotations may not cover all rare diseases mentions from the sampled discharge summaries.
* In row 323 from the full set or the validation set, the mention nph is not in the document structure (due to error in mention extraction), thus the gold mention-to-UMLS label is -1.

REBUS,REBUS Dataset,"Recent advances in large language models have led to the development of multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), which take both image data and text as an input. Virtually all of these models
have been announced within the past year, leading to a significant need for benchmarks
evaluating the abilities of these models to reason truthfully and accurately on a diverse set
of tasks. When Google announced Gemini (Gemini Team et al., 2023), they showcased its
ability to solve rebuses—wordplay puzzles which involve creatively adding and subtracting
letters from words derived from text and images. The diversity of rebuses allows for a
broad evaluation of multimodal reasoning capabilities, including image recognition, multi-
step reasoning, and understanding the human creator’s intent.
We present REBUS: a collection of 333 hand-crafted rebuses spanning 13 diverse cate-
gories, including hand-drawn and digital images created by nine contributors. Samples are
presented in Table 1. Notably, GPT-4V, the most powerful model we evaluated, answered
only 24% of puzzles correctly, highlighting the poor capabilities of MLLMs in new and unex-
pected domains to which human reasoning generalizes with comparative ease. Open-source
models perform even worse, with a median accuracy below 1%. We notice that models
often give faithless explanations, fail to change their minds after an initial approach doesn’t

RefCOCO,RefCOCO Dataset,"The RefCOCO dataset is a referring expression generation (REG) dataset used for tasks related to understanding natural language expressions that refer to specific objects in images. Here are the key details about RefCOCO:



Collection Method:
The dataset was collected using the ReferitGame, a two-player game. In this game, the first player views an image with a segmented target object and writes a natural language expression referring to that object. The second player sees only the image and the referring expression and must click on the corresponding object. If both players perform correctly, they earn points and switch roles; otherwise, they receive a new object and image for description.



Dataset Variants:
RefCOCO: Contains 142,209 refer expressions for 50,000 objects across 19,994 images. RefCOCO+: Includes 141,564 expressions for 49,856 objects in 19,992 images. RefCOCOg: This variant has 25,799 images, 95,010 referring expressions, and 49,822 object instances.



Language and Restrictions:
RefCOCO allows any type of language in the referring expressions. RefCOCO+ disallows location words in expressions to focus purely on appearance-based descriptions (e.g., ""the man in the yellow polka-dotted shirt"") rather than viewer-dependent descriptions (e.g., ""the second man from the left"").

Refer-YouTube-VOS,Refer-YouTube-VOS Dataset,"There exist previous works [6, 10] that constructed referring segmentation datasets for videos. Gavrilyuk et al. [6] extended the A2D [33] and J-HMDB [9] datasets with natural sentences; the datasets focus on describing the ‘actors’ and ‘actions’ appearing in videos, therefore the instance annotations are limited to only a few object categories corresponding to the dominant ‘actors’ performing a salient ‘action’. Khoreva et al. [10] built a dataset based on DAVIS [25], but the scales are barely sufficient to learn an end-to-end model from scratch

Youtube-VOS has 4,519 high-resolution videos with 94 common object categories. Each video has pixel-level instance segmentation annotation at every 5 frames in 30-fps videos, and their durations are around 3 to 6 seconds.

We employed Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate referring expressions. To ensure the quality of the annotations, we selected around 50 turkers after a validation test. Each turker was given a pair of videos, the original video and the mask-overlaid one with the target object highlighted, and was asked to provide a discriminative sentence within 20 words that describes the target object accurately. We collected two kinds of annotations, which describe the highlighted object (1) based on a whole video (Full-video expression) and (2) using only the
first frame of the video (First-frame expression). After the initial annotation, we conducted verification and cleaning jobs for all annotations, and dropped objects if an object cannot be localized using language expressions only. 

The followings are the statistics and analysis of the two annotation types of the dataset after the verification.

Full-video expression: Youtube-VOS has 6,459 and 1,063 unique objects in train and validation split, respectively. Among them, we cover 6,388 unique objects in 3,471 videos (6, 388/6, 459 = 98.9%) with 12,913 expressions in train split and 1,063 unique objects in 507 videos (1, 063/1, 063 = 100%) with 2,096 expressions in validation split. On average, each video has 3.8 language expressions and each expression has 10.0 words. 

First-frame expression: There are 6,006 unique objects in 3,412 videos (6, 006 /6, 459 = 93.0%) with 10,897 expressions in train split and 1,030 unique objects in 507 videos (1, 030/1, 063 = 96.9%) with 1,993 expressions in validation split. The number of annotated objects is lower than that of the full-video expressions because using only the first frame makes annotation more ambiguous and inconsistent and we dropped more annotations during the verification.

each video has 3.2 language expressions and each expression has 7.5 words.",https://youtube-vos.org/dataset/rvos/,EditCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License,"Image, Video",,,,,,,,"Referring Expression Segmentation, Referring Video Object Segmentation","referring-expression-segmentation-on-refer-1, referring-video-object-segmentation-on-refer, referring-expression-segmentation-on-refer",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/refer-youtube-vos,Computer Vision,Referring Expression Segmentation,Referring Expression Segmentation

Referring_Expressions_for_DAVIS_2016___2017,Referring Expressions for DAVIS 2016 & 2017 Dataset,"Our task is to localize and provide a pixel-level mask of an object on all video frames given a language referring expression obtained either by looking at the first frame only or the full video. To validate our approach we employ two popular video object segmentation datasets, DAVIS16 [38] and DAVIS17 [42]. These two datasets introduce various challenges, containing videos with single or multiple salient objects, crowded scenes, similar looking instances, occlusions, camera view changes, fast motion, etc.

DAVIS16 [38] consists of 30 training and 20 test videos of diverse object categories with all frames annotated with pixel-level accuracy. Note that in this dataset only a single object is annotated per video. For the multiple object video segmentation task we consider DAVIS17. Compared to DAVIS16, this is a more challenging dataset, with multiple objects annotated per video and more complex scenes with more distractors, occlusions, smaller objects, and fine structures. Overall, DAVIS17 consists of a training set with 60 videos, and a validation/test-dev/test-challenge set with 30 sequences each. 

As our goal is to segment objects in videos using language specifications, we augment all objects annotated with mask labels in DAVIS16 and DAVIS17 with non-ambiguous referring expressions. We follow the work of [34] and ask the annotator to provide a language description of the object, which has a mask annotation, by looking only at the
first frame of the video. Then another annotator is given the first frame and the corresponding description, and asked to identify the referred object. If the annotator is unable to correctly identify the object, the description is corrected to remove ambiguity and to specify the object uniquely. We have collected two referring expressions per target
object annotated by non-computer vision experts (Annotator 1, 2).

However, by looking only at the 1st frame, the obtained referring expressions may potentially be invalid for an entire video. (We actually quantified that only∼ 15% of the
collected descriptions become invalid over time and it does not affect strongly segmentation results as temporal consistency step helps to disambiguate some of such cases, see the supp. material for details.) Besides, in many applications, such as video editing or video-based advertisement, the user has access to a full video. Providing a language
query which is valid for all frames might decrease the editing time and result in more coherent predictions. Thus, on DAVIS17 we asked the workers to provide a description of the object by looking at the full video. We have collected one expression of the full video type per target object. Future work may choose to use either setting.

The average length for the first frame/full video expressions is 5.5/6.3 words. For DAVIS17 first frame annotations we notice that descriptions given by Annotator 1 are longer than the ones by Annotator 2 (6.4 vs. 4.6 words). We evaluate the effect of description length on the grounding performance in §5. Besides, the expressions relevant to a full video mention verbs more often than the first frame descriptions (44% vs. 25%). This is intuitive, as referring to an object which changes its appearance and position over time may require mentioning its actions. Adjectives are present in over 50% for all annotations. Most of them refer to colors (over 70%), shapes and sizes (7%) and spatial/ordering words (6% first frame vs. 13% full video expressions). The full video expressions also have a higher number of adverbs and prepositions, and overall are more complex than the ones provided for the first frame.

The world faces considerable challenges in terms of eye care, including inequalities in the coverage and quality of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Early detection and diagnosis of ocular pathologies would enable forestall of visual impairment. One challenge that limits the adoption of a computer-aided diagnosis tool by the ophthalmologist is, the sight-threatening rare pathologies such as central retinal artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and others are usually ignored. In the past two decades, many publicly available datasets of color fundus images have been collected with a primary focus on diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, and few other frequent pathologies.

RETWEET,RETWEET Dataset,"RETWEET is a dataset of tweets and overall predominant sentiment of their replies.

SUMMARY
WHAT: Message-level Polarity Classification.

GOAL: To predict the predominant sentiment among (potential) first-order replies to a given tweet.

IDEA: Mitigate the problem of lacking labeled training data wi treating the unsupervised nature of the problem as a supervised learning case.

APPROACH:

Train a tweet classifier. 
Automatically label the replies using the classifier trained in the first part.
Choose a final label representing the general predominant sentiment of the replies of every tweet.

DATA COLLECTION
To download all of the replies to a tweet, the Search API should be used. However, the Search API is limited to 75000 requests per hour, which causes the mining and downloading process to be slow.
Furthermore, using the Twitter API, there is no possibility of downloading absolute random data. Therefore, we try to make the procedure as random as possible by utilizing two different strategies for data downloading and using them in an intermixed manner.



Our first strategy is based on a sample of English tweets obtained by filtering the Twitter stream via a list of cultural keywords. This list consists of 147 words that are deemed to play a ""pivotal role in discussions of culture and society"", covering diverse words such as aesthetics, environment, feminism, power, tourism, or youth. We extracted all tweets in 2019 that have a minimum of 20 first-order replies in the dataset. The data come with an obvious caveat: Both the source tweet as well as all the replies must contain at least one word from the list of keywords. Therewith, it is highly unlikely that the list of replies for any given source is exhaustive, i.e. there might be many more first-order replies to the source tweet that are not in the dataset.



As our second approach, we use the GetOldTweets3 library to download all the replies corresponding to every tweet. We define few restrictions to add randomization to the process. Firstly, every tweet and also every reply should contain at least 20 strings. This is due to the fact that our automatic tweet classifier, explsined in the paper, is optimized based on the message-level classification paradigm. Therefore, it operates optimal when the input contains at least a sufficient number of words. The second constraint is that every tweet should contain at least 20 first-order replies. In order to increase randomness, in this strategy, instead of referencing to a list of keywords, we manually choose some keywords, which are most likely to include long discussions, such as Coronavirus and football or the ones, which are most likely to include strong opinions such as birthday, war, or racism in order to account for the easy-to-guess examples. 



MANUAL ANNOTATIONS FOR THE RETWEET (TEST GOLD DATASET)
5,015 tweets with their corresponding replies, collected as a combination of the two different collection strategies, were given to three different students. Each of them had to read all the replies corresponding to every tweet, without observing the original tweet in order to avoid having a prior knowledge, and decide on ONE final sentiment for the replies. The assigned sentiment can only be one of the positive, negative, or neutral labels.

Considering the fact that this is a really challenging task for the machine, to prevent human mistakes, we correlated the results of the three annotators and only chose the tweets, in which all of the annotators had the same opinion on the labels, as the final gold standard test data. Therefore, we finally, ended up with a test set consisting of 1,519 human labeled tweets, with the labels being the sentiment of the replies of a tweet and not the tweet itself.

Overview
This repository contains data for paper ReviewRobot: Explainable Paper Review Generation based on Knowledge Synthesis. [Dataset]

Dataset
There are three folders: Raw_data, IE_result, and KGs. 

Raw_data folder
The Raw_data has two parts: Background Corpus and Paper-review Corpus. 

We create the Background Corpus by selecting machine learning related pappers from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. It contains papers with their titles and abstracts published from the year of 1965 to 2019 (included).

The Paper-review Corpus contains parsed paper pdfs and their corresponding reviews. The paper-review pairs of acl_2017 and iclr_2017 folders come from PeerRead dataset. We fetched the rest from OpenReview and NeruIPS. We parsed those pdfs using GROBID. In each folder, metadata.txt contains all human reviews, and the txt/ folder contains all processed papers.

IE_result folder
The IE_result folder contains information extraction results from SciIE. In each group, the *_json/ contains tokenized texts, and the *_output/ contains IE results of tokenized texts.

The Background_IE contains two folders from one group for all paper abstracts from 1965 to 2019.

The Paper-review_IE contains four folders from two groups. The first group: iclrnipsabs_json and iclrnipsabs_output contain IE results for abstracts of Paper-review Corpus. The second group: iclrnips_json and iclrnips_output contain IE results for rest of papers in Paper-review Corpus.

KGs
The KGs folder contains the knowledge graphs built on the IE_result. 

back_kg
The back_kg contains the background KGs built up to a certain year. For each year, there are three files. 

Take 2012 as an example:
*   2012.pkl contains the background knowledge graph up to (include) 2012. It contains a dictionary of 6 fields: num_doc is the number of papers up to that year, cluster2entity is a mapping from the entity to its mentions, entity2cluster is a mapping from the mention to its corresponding entity, cluster2type is a mapping from the entity to its type, entity refers to all mentions in current KG, and relations refers to all relations in current KG. 
*   2012_key.pkl contains the mappings from knowledge elements to paper ids. It has two fields: cluster is the mapping from an entity to its corresponding paper ids, and relation is the mapping from a relation to the corresponding paper ids.
*   2012_paper contains the mappings from paper id to its paper title.

idea_kg
The idea_kg folder contains idea KGs constructed from paper abstracts and conclusions. Each line is a paper in the venue and has the following fields: id for the paper id, abs_num for the number of abstract sentences, sent for all sentences related to  idea_kg, entity for all mentions in current KG, cluster2sent for the corresponding sentence ids for a specific entity, entity2num for the occurence of a specific mention, relation2num for the occurence of a specific relation, cluster2entity for a mapping from the entity to its mentions, entity2type conains a mapping from the mention to the type, relations for all relations in current KG, relation2sent for corresponding sentence ids for a specific relation, and entity2cluster for a mapping from the mention to its corresponding entity. 

related_kg
The related_kg contains related KGs constructed from related work for each venue. It is of the same structure as idea_kg.

contribute_kg
The contribute_kg contains contribute KGs constructed from paper contribution section (under introduction section) and experiment section. It contains a dictionary of 4 fields:  id for the paper id,  total for the number of entities covered in the contribution section, covered for the number of entities covered in the experiment section, sents related sentences that covered those entities from both sections.

future_kg
The future_kg contains future KGs constructed from future work for each venue. It is of the same structure as idea_kg.

Review-annotation
The Review-annotation folder contains human annotations for review category and paper-review sentence pairs. The review.txt contains annotation for review category including 236 sentences for ""SUMMARY"", 33 sentences for ""NOVELTY"", 174 sentences for ""SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS"", 16 sentences for ""MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON"", and 14 sentences for ""IMPACT"". The pair.txt   contains 2,535 review-paper pairs. For each pair, the first slot is the review sentence; the second slot is the paper sentence, the third slot is the label where 0 indicates two sentences are not related and 1 indicates they are related.

RF100,RF100 Dataset,"The evaluation of object detection models is usually performed by optimizing a single metric, e.g. mAP, on a fixed set of datasets, e.g. Microsoft COCO and Pascal VOC. Due to image retrieval and annotation costs, these datasets consist largely of images found on the web and do not represent many real-life domains that are being modelled in practice, e.g. satellite, microscopic and gaming, making it difficult to assert the degree of generalization learned by the model.

We introduce the Roboflow-100 (RF100) consisting of 100 datasets, 7 imagery domains, 224,714 images, and 805 class labels with over 11,170 labelling hours. We derived RF100 from over 90,000 public datasets, 60 million public images that are actively being assembled and labelled by computer vision practitioners in the open on the web application Roboflow Universe. By releasing RF100, we aim to provide a semantically diverse, multi-domain benchmark of datasets to help researchers test their model's generalizability with real-life data.

RFUND,RFUND Dataset,"RFUND is a relabeled version of FUNSD and XFUND datasets, tackling the following issues in their original annotations:


Entity (block) level OCR results. Real-world OCR engines usually produce line-level results, while the annotations in FUNSD and XFUND are at the entity (block) level. Text lines within the same entity are aggregated and serialized in human reading order, simplifying the task scope and failing to reflect real-world challenges.
Inconsistent labelling granularity. In FUNSD, while most contents are annotated at the entity level, multi-line entities with first-line indentation are annotated separately, in which the first line is split out and the rest are aggregated. XFUND exhibits variable granularity in annotations, with some contents labelled at the entity level and others at the line level. Such inconsistent labelling standards can hinder model training.
Erroneous category annotations. Entities in FUNSD/XFUND are categorized as ""header"", ""question"", ""answer"" and ""other"". We observed that certain entities in both FUNSD and XFUND have category labels that differ from human understanding. In the following example, the answer entity “Client confirmed agreement ...” was labelled as other, while the other entity “CONFIDENTIAL” was labelled as the question.",https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/RFUND,EditUnknown,,,,,,,,,Key-value Pair Extraction,key-value-pair-extraction-on-rfund-en,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/rfund,Methodology,Key-value Pair Extraction,Key-value Pair Extraction

The dataset also includes various environmental challenges such as rainy conditions, nighttime scenes, cold and hot weather scenarios. To analyze the performance of different tracking algorithms based on specific attributes, the RGBT234 dataset annotates 12 attributes and provides baseline trackers, including both deep learning and non-deep learning methods like structured SVM, sparse representation, and correlation filter-based trackers.

The database was collected by asking volunteers to write handwritten letters in exchange of gift vouchers. Volunteer were given a fictional identity (same sex as the real one) and up to 5 scenarios. Each scenario has been chosen among 9 realistic following themes : change of personal information (address, bank account), information request, opening and closing (customer account), modification of contract or order, complaint (bad service quality…), payment difficulties (asking for a delay, tax exemption…), reminder letter, damage declaration with further circumstances and a destination (administrations or service providers (telephone, power, bank, insurances). The volunteers composed a letter with those pieces of information using their own words. The layout was free and it was only asked to use white paper and to write in a readable way with black ink.

The collect was a success with more than 1,300 people who have participated to the RIMES database creation by writing up to 5 mails.

RoomEnv-v0,RoomEnv-v0 Dataset,"The Room environment - v0


We have released a challenging Gymnasium compatible
environment. The best strategy for this environment is to have both episodic and semantic
memory systems. See the paper for more information.

Prerequisites

A unix or unix-like x86 machine
python 3.10 or higher.
Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up with the system python.
This env is added to the PyPI server. Just run: pip install room-env

Data collection
Data is collected from querying ConceptNet APIs. For simplicity, we only collect triples
whose format is (head, atlocation, tail). Here head is one of the 80 MS COCO
dataset categories. This was kept in mind so that later on we can use images as well.

If you want to collect the data manually, then run below:

python collect_data.py

How does this environment work?
The Gymnasium-compatible Room environment is one big room with
N<sub>people</sub> number of people who can freely move
around. Each of them selects one object, among
N<sub>objects</sub>, and places it in one of the
N<sub>locations</sub> locations.
N<sub>agents</sub> number of agent(s) are also in this
room. They can only observe one human placing an object, one at a time;
x<sup>(t)</sup>. At the same time, they are given one question
about the location of an object; q<sup>(t)</sup>.
x<sup>(t)</sup> is given as a quadruple,
(h<sup>(t)</sup>,r<sup>(t)</sup>,t<sup>(t)</sup>,t),
For example, &lt;James’s laptop, atlocation, James’s desk, 42&gt; accounts
for an observation where an agent sees James placing his laptop on his
desk at t = 42. q<sup>(t)</sup> is given as a double,
(h,r). For example, &lt;Karen’s cat, atlocation&gt; is asking where
Karen’s cat is located. If the agent answers the question correctly, it
gets a reward of  + 1, and if not, it gets 0.

The reason why the observations and questions are given as
RDF-triple-like format is two folds. One is that this structured format
is easily readable / writable by both humans and machines. Second is
that we can use existing knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet .

To simplify the environment, the agents themselves are not actually
moving, but the room is continuously changing. There are several random
factors in this environment to be considered:



With the chance of p<sub>commonsense</sub>,
   a human places an object in a commonsense location (e.g., a laptop
   on a desk). The commonsense knowledge we use is from ConceptNet.
   With the chance of
   1 − p<sub>commonsense</sub>, an object is
   placed at a non-commonsense random location (e.g., a laptop on the
   tree).



With the chance of
   p<sub>new_location</sub>, a human changes
   object location.



With the chance of p<sub>new_object</sub>, a
   human changes his/her object to another one.



With the chance of
   p<sub>switch_person</sub>, two people
   switch their locations. This is done to mimic an agent moving around
   the room.



All of the four probabilities account for the Bernoulli distributions.

Consider there is only one agent. Then this is a POMDP, where S<sub>t</sub> = (x<sup>(t)</sup>, q<sup>(t)</sup>), A<sub>t</sub> = (do something with x<sup>(t)</sup>, answer q<sup>(t)</sup>), and R<sub>t</sub> ∈ {0, 1}.

Currently there is no RL trained for this. We only have some heuristics. Take a look at the paper for more details.

RoomEnv-v0
```python
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make(""room_env:RoomEnv-v0"")
(observation, question), info = env.reset()
rewards = 0

while True:
    (observation, question), reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(""This is my answer!"")
    rewards += reward
    if done:
        break

print(rewards)
```

Every time when an agent takes an action, the environment will give you an observation
and a question to answer. You can try directly answering the question,
such as env.step(""This is my answer!""), but a better strategy is to keep the
observations in memory systems and take advantage of the current observation and the
history of them in the memory systems.

Take a look at this repo for an actual
interaction with this environment to learn a policy.

ROOR,ROOR Dataset,"ROOR is a reading order prediction (ROP) benchmark which annotates layout reading order as ordering relations. 

Layout reading order is typically formulated as a permutation of layout elements, i.e. a sequence containing all the layout elements. 
However, multiple cases have reflected that this formulation does not adequately convey the complete reading order information in the layout, which may negatively affect the utilization of this signal in downstream VrD tasks. 

Therefore, this work investigate the properties of layout reading order, conceptualizing it with terms Immediate Succession During Reading(ISDR) and Generalized Succession During Reading(GSDR), and formulate each of which as an ordering relation over layout elements. 
Then, ROOR provides the annotation of the ISDR relationship over layout segments, based on the layout annotation of EC-FUNSD. 
Overall, ROOR comprises 199 samples including 10,662 segments, 31,297 words and 10,967 annotated reading order linking pairs.
We hope the construction of this benchmark could facilitate the development of automated ROP methods of the improved task form.",https://github.com/chongzhangFDU/ROOR-Datasets,EditCC-BY-4.0,"Graph, Image",,,,,199 samples,,,"Relation Extraction, Reading Order Detection",reading-order-detection-on-roor,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/roor,Computer Vision,Relation Extraction,Relation Extraction

RUSSE,RUSSE Dataset,"WiC: The Word-in-Context Dataset A reliable benchmark for the evaluation of context-sensitive word embeddings.

Depending on its context, an ambiguous word can refer to multiple, potentially unrelated, meanings. Mainstream static word embeddings, such as Word2vec and GloVe, are unable to reflect this dynamic semantic nature. Contextualised word embeddings are an attempt at addressing this limitation by computing dynamic representations for words which can adapt based on context.

RuWorldTree,RuWorldTree Dataset,"RuWorldTree is a QA dataset with multiple-choice elementary-level science questions, which evaluate the understanding of core science facts.

Motivation

The WorldTree dataset starts the triad of the Reasoning and Knowledge tasks. The data includes the corpus of factoid utterances of various kinds, complex factoid questions and a corresponding causal chain of facts from the corpus resulting in a correct answer.

The WorldTree design was originally proposed in (Jansen et al., 2018).

An example in English for illustration purposes:

```{
    'question': 'A bottle of water is placed in the freezer. What property of water will change when the water reaches the freezing point? (A) color (B) mass (C) state of matter (D) weight', 

'answer': 'C',

'exam_name': 'MEA',

'school_grade': 5,

'knowledge_type': 'NO TYPE',

'perturbation': 'ru_worldtree',

'episode': [18, 10, 11]

Data Fields


text: a string containing the sentence text
answer: a string with a candidate for the coreference resolution
options: a list of all the possible candidates present in the text
reference: a string containing an anaphor (a word or phrase that refers back to an earlier word or phrase)
homonymia_type: a float corresponding to the type of the structure with syntactic homonymy
label: an integer, either 0 or 1, indicating whether the homonymy is resolved correctly or not
perturbation: a string containing the name of the perturbation applied to text. If no perturbation was applied, the dataset name is used
episode: a list of episodes in which the instance is used. Only used for the train set

Data Splits

The set would then be presented as a challenge for AI programs, along the lines of the Turing test. The strengths of the challenge are that it is clear-cut, in that the answer to each schema is a binary choice; vivid, in that it is obvious to non-experts that a program that fails to get the right answers clearly has serious gaps in its understanding; and difficult, in that it is far beyond the current state of the art.

SAGC-A68,SAGC-A68 Dataset,"The analysis of building models for usable area, building safety, and energy efficiency requires accurate classification data of spaces and space elements. To reduce input model preparation effort and errors, automated classification of spaces and space elements is desirable. Although existing space function classifiers use space adjacency or connectivity graphs as input, the application of Graph Deep Learning (GDL) to space layout element classification has not been extensively researched due to the lack of suitable datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a dataset named SAGC-A68, which comprises access graphs automatically generated from 68 digital 3D models of space layouts of apartment buildings designed or built between 1952 and 2019 in 13 countries. Each access graph contains nodes representing spaces and space elements and edges representing the connection between them. Nodes are uniquely identified and characterized by 16 features including “Position X”, “Position Y”, “Position Z”, “Width”, “Height”, “Depth”, “Area”, “Volume”, “Is_internal”, “Door_opening_quantity”, “Window_quantity”, “Max_door_width”,” Encloses_ws”, “Is_contained_in_ws”, ”bounding_box”, and “Label” (28 identified labels are shown in bold type in Table 1). Edges are identified by a unique ID and characterized by three features, including “Z_angle”, “Delta_z”, and “Length”. In total, the dataset comprises 4871 nodes and 4566 edges, including disconnected nodes representing shafts.

The sub tasks can be categorised into two main categories: acoustic consistency and semantic-acoustic alignment. In semantic consistency, the positive sample is a real recording and the negative one is with the same spoken content but an acoustic feature (e.g. speaker) changes mid recording. In the alignment sub-task, the positive recording is one where the text matches the acoustic element (e.g sentiment) and the negative is where they don't.

SBS_Figures,SBS Figures Dataset,"Building a large-scale figure QA dataset requires a considerable amount of work, from gathering and selecting figures to extracting attributes like text, numbers, and colors, and generating QAs. Although recent developments in LLMs have led to efforts to synthesize figures, most of these focus primarily on QA generation. Additionally, creating figures directly using LLMs often encounters issues such as code errors, similar-looking figures, and repetitive content in figures. To address this issue, we present SBSFigures (Stage-by-Stage Synthetic Figures), a dataset for pre-training figure QA. Our proposed pipeline enables the creation of chart figures with complete annotations of the visualized data and dense QA annotations without any manual annotation process. Our stage-by-stage pipeline makes it possible to create diverse topic and appearance figures efficiently while minimizing code errors. Our SBSFigures demonstrate a strong pre-training effect, making it possible to achieve efficient training with a limited amount of real-world chart data starting from our pre-trained weights.",https://omron-sinicx.github.io/SBSFiguresPage/,EditUnknown,Text,English,,,,,,,"Chart Understanding, Chart Question Answering",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sbsfigures,Natural Language Processing,Chart Understanding,Chart Understanding

SCG,SCG Dataset,"Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained traction in transportation, bioinformatics, language and image processing, but research on their application to supply chain management remains limited. Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical ML and other deep learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13652826,EditMIT,"Graph, Image, Time Series",,,,,,,,"Product Relation Classification, Production Forecasting, Demand Forecasting, Product Categorization, Product Relation Detection","product-categorization-on-scg, product-relation-classification-on-scg, production-forecasting-on-scg, demand-forecasting-on-scg, product-relation-detection-on-scg",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/scg,Computer Vision,Product Relation Classification,Product Relation Classification

Each sample in ScFiGraphQA consists of a scientific graph image sourced from papers on ArXiv, accompanied by rich textual context including the paper's title, abstract, figure caption, and a paragraph from the paper referencing the figure. Using this comprehensive context, the dataset employs a  to produce multi-turn question-answer dialogues aimed at explaining the given graph in an interactive, conversational format. On average, each sample contains 2-3 turns of question-answer exchange.

The key motivation behind SciGraphQA is providing a large-scale resource to support research and development of multi-modal AI systems that can engage in informative, open-ended conversations about graphs and data visualizations. The multi-turn dialogue format presents a more natural and interactive setting compared to standard visual question answering datasets that use fixed sets of standalone questions.

Potential use cases of SciGraphQA include pre-training and benchmarking multi-modal conversational models for scientific graph comprehension, building AI assistants that can discuss data insights, and developing aids to help individuals understand complex figures and diagrams interactively.

SD-Eval,SD-Eval Dataset,"Speech encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to content, paralinguistic, and environmental information.
This comprehensive nature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for human-computer interaction.
Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle multi-modal inputs, including speech.
Although these models can be adept at recognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating appropriate responses.
We argue that this is due to the lack of principles on task definition and model development, which requires open-source datasets and metrics suitable for model evaluation.
To bridge the gap, we present SD-Eval, a benchmark dataset aimed at multidimensional evaluation of spoken dialogue understanding and generation.
SD-Eval focuses on paralinguistic and environmental information and includes 7,303 utterances, amounting to 8.76 hours of speech data. The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound.
To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a process similar to that of SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. 
We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses.
Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures.
Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics.

The contributed dataset includes more than  1 million queries and 2 million answers,  annotated with a rich set of features modeling the social interactions among the users of a popular cQA platform. We describe the characteristics of SE-PQA and detail the features associated with both questions and answers. We also provide reproducible baseline methods for the cQA task based on the resource, including deep learning models and personalization approaches. The results of the preliminary experiments conducted show the appropriateness of SE-PQA to train effective cQA models; they also show that personalization improves remarkably the effectiveness of all the methods tested.

The annotation of SECOND is carried out by an expert group of earth vision applications, which guarantees high label accuracy. For the change category in the SECOND dataset, we focus on 6 main land-cover classes, i.e. , non-vegetated ground surface, tree, low vegetation, water, buildings and playgrounds , that are frequently involved in natural and man-made geographical changes. It is worth noticing that, in the new dataset, non-vegetated ground surface ( n.v.g. surface for short) mainly corresponds to impervious surface and bare land. In summary, these 6 selected land-cover categories result in 30 common change categories (including non-change ).

SeizeIT1,SeizeIT1 Dataset,"This dataset is obtained during an ICON project (2017-2018) in collaboration with KU Leuven (ESAT-STADIUS), UZ Leuven, UCB, Byteflies and Pilipili. The goal of this project was to design a system using Behind the ear (bhE) EEG electrodes for monitoring the patient in a home environment. This way, a nice balance can be found between sufficient accuracy of seizure detection algorithms (because EEG is used) and wearability (bhe EEG is relatively subtle, similar to a hear-aid device). The dataset acquired in the hospital during presurgical evaluation. During such presurgical evaluation, neurologists try to see if a specific part of the brain is causing the seizures, and if so, if that part of the brain can be removed during surgery. During the presurgical evaluation, patients are monitored using the vEEG for multiple days (typically a week). Patients are however restricted to move within their room because of the wiring and video analysis. In this dataset, following data is available per patient: • Full 10-20 scalp EEG data of the patient during the presurgical evaluation. • Behind-the-ear data (2 sensors positioned behind each ear) • Single-lead ECG data (typically lead II) Seizures are annotated by the clinicians based on the gold standard vEEG system. These seizure annotations are also available in the dataset. In total 82 patients were recorded between 23/01/2017 and 26/10/2018. From those patients, 54 were recorded with the bhe channels. Forty-two of those patients had seizures during their presurgical evaluation, while for twelve patients no seizure has been recorded. The number of seizures per patient ranged from 1 to 22, with a median of 3 seizures per patient. The duration of the seizures, the time difference of seizure EEG onset and end, varied between 11 and 695 seconds with a median of 50 seconds. 89% of the seizures were Focal Impaired Awareness seizures. 91% of the seizures originated from the (fronto-) temporal lobe. In the folder ’Data’ the raw data in the form of .edf, are provided with annotations for all the patients. The annotations are provided in .tsv (tab separated values) files. For every seizure the first column represents the starting point (in seconds) of the seizure, the second one the end point of the seizure, the third one the type of the seizure, while in the last column extra information are provided. The extra information includes the origin of the seizure, the hemisphere and if the seizure can be noted from the behind the ear channels (bhe:1 in that case). In the header section of every file information concerning the dataset and the annotations used are included. For every subject and for every session (even if no seizure is present) two different sets of annotations are provided. The ”a1”set of annotations is the annotations as provided by the doctors. The ”a2” set of annotations are the annotations used in [2] for training of the algorithm. The annotations provided from the doctors were not always perfectly aligned with the typical rhythmic ictal pattern, hence in ”a2” a refinement of the start of each annotation was performed visually by an engineer. Furthermore, in the annotations of the doctor the end point of some seizures was missing (”none”) in the ”a2” subset of annotations each seizure was considered with a stable length of 10 seconds.",https://rdr.kuleuven.be/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48804/P5Q0OJ,EditCustom KU Leuven,Image,,2017,,,,,,Seizure Detection,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/seizeit1,Computer Vision,Seizure Detection,Seizure Detection

The composition of the corpora was limited by the effect of copyright laws as well as historical imbalances. Most works were obtained from US and Australian Gutenberg Projects. The corpora is expected to grow in size and diversity over time.  

Several dimensions of diversity were considered for inclusion including popularity, period, genre, topic, style and author diversity. The first version of our corpus includes only English, although Proust and Homer are included in translation. SentimentArcs has processed a larger set of novels, including some in foreign languages. The initial reference corpus is in English since performance across all ensemble models was uneven in less resourced languages

In sum, the corpora includes (1) the two most popular novels on Gutenberg.org (Project Gutenberg, 2021b), (2) eight of the fifteen most assigned novels at top US universities (EAB, 2021), and (3) three works that have sold over 20 million copies (Books, 2021).

Identifying rumors on social networks is carried out in the form of rumor detection approaches; the massive amount of these news and information force to use the machine learning techniques. The most important problem with auto-detection approaches is the lack of a database of rumors.

SHADR,SHADR Dataset,"SDoH Human Annotated Demoographic Robustness (SHADR) Dataset
Overview
The Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a pivotal role in determining patient outcomes. However, their documentation in electronic health records (EHR) remains incomplete. This dataset was created from a study examining the capability of large language models in extracting SDoH from the free text sections of EHRs. Furthermore, the study delved into the potential of synthetic clinical text to bolster the extraction process of these scarcely documented, yet crucial, clinical data.

Dataset Structure & Modification
To understand potential biases in high-performing models and in those pre-trained on general text, GPT-4 was utilized to infuse demographic descriptors into our synthetic data. 

For instance:
- Original Sentence: ""Widower admits fears surrounding potential judgment…""
- Modified Sentence: ""Hispanic widower admits fears surrounding potential judgment...""

Such demographic-infused sentences underwent manual validation. Out of these:
- 419 had mentions of SDoH
- 253 had mentions of adverse SDoH
- The remainder were tagged as NO_SDoH

Instructions for Model Evaluation

Initially, run your model inference on the original sentences.
Subsequently, apply the same model to infer on the demographic-modified sentences.
Perform comparisons for robustness.

For a detailed understanding of the ""adverse"" labeling, refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06354.pdf. Here, the 'adverse' column demarcates if the label corresponds to an ""adverse"" or ""non-adverse"" SDoH.

Current Performance Metrics

Best Model Performance:
Any SDoH: 88% Macro-F1 

Adverse SDoH: 84% Macro-F1



Robustness Rate:


Any SDoH: 9.9%
Adverse SDoH: 14.3%

The questions are built around compositions of concepts and relations, e.g. Is there a red shape above a circle? or Is a red shape blue?. Questions contain between two and four attributes, object types, or relationships. There are 244 questions and 15,616 images in total, with all questions having a yes and no answer (and corresponding supporting image). This eliminates the risk of learning biases.

Each image is a 30×30 RGB image depicting a 3×3 grid of objects.

Project web page
More details can be found at: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/sihdr_benchmark/

Overview
This dataset contains 181 RAW exposure stacks selected to cover a wide range of image content and lighting conditions. Each scene is composed of 5 RAW exposures and merged into an HDR image using the estimator that accounts photon noise [3] (code at HDRutils). A simple color correction was applied using a reference white point and all merged HDR images were resized to 1920×1280 pixels.

The primary purpose of the dataset was to compare various single image HDR (SI-HDR) methods [1]. Thus, we selected a wide variety of content covering nature, portraits, cities, indoor and outdoor, daylight and night scenes. After merging and resizing, we simulated captures by applying a custom CRF and added realistic camera noise based on estimated noise parameters of Canon 5D Mark III.

The simulated captures were inputs to six selected SI-HDR methods. You can view the reconstructions of various methods for select scenes on our interactive viewer. For the remaining scenes, please download the appropriate zip files. We conducted a rigorous pairwise comparison experiment on these images to find that widely-used metrics did not correlate well with subjective data. We then proposed an improved evaluation protocol for SI-HDR [1].

SIMARA,SIMARA Dataset,"Description
We propose a new database for information extraction from historical handwritten documents. The corpus includes 5,393 finding aids from six different series, dating from the 18th-20th centuries. Finding aids are handwritten documents that contain metadata describing older archives. They are stored in the National Archives of France and are used by archivists to identify and find archival documents. 

Each document is annotated at page-level, and contains seven fields to retrieve. The localization of each field is not available in such a way that this dataset encourages research on segmentation-free systems for information extraction.

The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/7868059

Existing task-oriented dialog datasets aimed towards virtual assistance fall short and do not situate the dialog in the user's multimodal context. To overcome, we present a new dataset for Situated and Interactive Multimodal Conversations, SIMMC 2.0, which includes 11K task-oriented user<->assistant dialogs (117K utterances) in the shopping domain, grounded in immersive and photo-realistic scenes.
The dialogs are collected using a two-phase pipeline: (1) A novel multimodal dialog simulator generates simulated dialog flows, with an emphasis on diversity and richness of interactions, (2) Manual paraphrasing of the generated utterances to collect diverse referring expressions. We provide an in-depth analysis of the collected dataset, and describe in detail the four main benchmark tasks we propose.

Sims4Action,Sims4Action Dataset,"The Sims4Action Dataset: a videogame-based dataset for Synthetic→Real domain adaptation for human activity recognition.



Goal : Exploring the concept of constructing training examples for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition by playing life simulation video games.  


 Sims4Action  dataset is created with the commercial game THE SIMS 4   by executing actions-of-interest within the game in a ""top-down"" manner. It features ten hours of video material of eight diverse characters and multiple environments.  Ten actions are selected to have a direct correspondence to categories covered in the real-life dataset Toyota Smarthome [2] to enable the research of Synthetic→Real transfer in action recognition.
Two benchmarks : Gaming→Gaming (training and evaluation on Sims4Action)  and Gaming→Real (training on Sims4Action, evaluation on the real Toyota Smarthome data [2]).
Main challenge: Gaming→Real domain adaptation
  While ADL recognition on gaming data is interesting from a theoretical perspective, the key challenge arises from transferring knowledge learned from simulated data to real-world applications. Sims4Action specifically provides a benchmark for this scenario since it describes a Gaming→Real challenge, which evaluates models on real videos derived from the existing Toyota Smarthome dataset .

Simulated_micro-Doppler_Signatures,Simulated micro-Doppler Signatures Dataset,"Simulated pulse Doppler radar signatures for four classes of helicopter-like targets. The classes differ in the number of rotating blades each kind of target carries, thus each class translates into a specific modulation pattern on the Doppler signature. Doppler signatures are a typical feature used to achieve radar targets discrimination. This dataset was generated using a simple open-source MATLAB simulation code, which can be easily modified to generate custom datasets with more classes and increased intra-class diversity. 

Dataset can be easily used for supervised classification, out-of-distribution detection (near and far), unsupervised learning and modulation pattern segmentation. The code includes the generation of an SPD representation for each signature, thanks to the computation of a covariance matrix, thus allowing for second-order specific data processing (e.g. Riemannian neural network or tangent PCA).

The data was collected to design a corn yield prediction model to help smallholder farmers make smart farming decisions. However, the data can serve several other purposes through analysis and interpretation.

The reference study region in Africa is Nigeria. The focuses on corn crop because there are over 211.4 million people, of which a large percentage of the population are smallholder farmers. Nigeria [9.0820° N, 8.6753° E] is within an arable land area of 34 million hectares located on the west coast of Africa. The region comprises of 36 states with the most and least number of districts being 214 and 10, respectively. For each state, the environment data are collected as follows. 

Grid map climate data – This data spans spatial resolutions between ~1 km2 to ~340 km2 from the high spatial resolution WorldClim global climate database22. Each grid point on the map is monthly data from January to December between 1970 and 2000 years and records 8 climate variables. The variables are average temperature C0, minimum temperature C0, maximum temperature C0, precipitation (mm), solar radiation (kJ m^(-2) day(-1), wind speed (m s(-1)), and water vapor (kPa) taken at 30 seconds (s), 2.5 minutes m, 5 m, and 10 m. 

Grid map soil data – This data is obtained from 250 minutes of spatial resolution AfSIS soil data23 from year 1960 to 2012. The variables are wet soil bulk density, dry bulk density (kg dm-3), clay percentage of plant available water content, hydraulic conductivity, the upper limit of plant available water content, the lower limit of, organic matter percentage, pH, sand percentage (g 100 g-1), silt percentage (g 100 g-1) and, clay percentage (g 100 g-1), and saturated volumetric water content variables measured at depths 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60–80, 80–100, and 100–120 measured in centimeters (cm). 

Corn yield data – This data is available on Kneoma Corporation website24. It ranged from years 1995 to 2006 and consisted of a corn yield of 1000 metric tonnes and a cultivation area of 1000 hectares.  

Geolocation coordinates (latitude and longitude) – The geolocation of each of the 36 states with their districts is sampled from Google Maps. The output feds into the Esri-ArcGIS 2.5, a professional geographical software, for extracting the point-cloud values of each environmental variable (weather and soil) at specific geolocation of the 36 states of Nigeria.

The previous challenges (SMAC) recognized as a standard benchmark of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning are mainly concerned with ensuring that all agents cooperatively eliminate approaching adversaries only through fine manipulation with obvious reward functions. This challenge, on the other hand, is interested in the exploration capability of MARL algorithms to efficiently learn implicit multi-stage tasks and environmental factors as well as micro-control. This study covers both offensive and defensive scenarios. In the offensive scenarios, agents must learn to first find opponents and then eliminate them.

SMART-101,SMART-101 Dataset,"Recent times have witnessed an increasing number of applications of deep neural networks towards solving tasks that require superior cognitive abilities, e.g., playing Go, generating art, ChatGPT, etc. Such a dramatic progress raises the question: how generalizable are neural networks in solving problems that demand broad skills? To answer this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task (and the associated SMART-101 dataset) for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed specifically for children of younger age (6--8). Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including pattern recognition, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To train deep neural networks, we programmatically augment each puzzle to 2,000 new instances; each instance varied in appearance, associated natural language question, and its solution. To foster research and make progress in the quest for artificial general intelligence, we are publicly releasing our SMART-101 dataset, consisting of the full set of programmatically-generated instances of 101 puzzles and their solutions.

Solar-Power,Solar-Power Dataset,"Solar Power Data for Integration Studies
NREL's Solar Power Data for Integration Studies are synthetic solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant data points for the United States representing the year 2006.

The data are intended for use by energy professionals—such as transmission planners, utility planners, project developers, and university researchers—who perform solar integration studies and need to estimate power production from hypothetical solar plants.

Data Methodologies
The Solar Power Data for Integration Studies consist of 1 year (2006) of 5-minute solar power and hourly day-ahead forecasts for approximately 6,000 simulated PV plants. Solar power plant locations were determined based on the capacity expansion plan for high-penetration renewables in Phase 2 of the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study and the Eastern Renewable Generation Integration Study.

NREL generated the 5-minute data set using the Sub-Hour Irradiance Algorithm. The day-ahead solar forecast data for locations in the western United States were generated by 3TIER based on numerical weather predication simulations for Phase 1 of the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study. NREL generated the day-ahead solar forecast data in eastern U.S. locations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model.

The data are for specific years and should not be assumed to be representative of typical radiation levels for a site. These data should not generally be used for site-specific project development work.

Naming Convention
The naming convention of the state-wise solar power data (.csv files) from the Solar Integration Studies is as follows.

Data Type_Latitude_Longitude_Weather Year_PV Type_CapacityMW_Time Interval _Min.csv

Data Type
Actual: Real power output
DA: Day ahead forecast
HA4: 4 hour ahead forecast
Weather Year: The PV data is based on the particular year's known weather condition.
PV Type
UPV: Utility scale PV
DPV: Distributed PV

Note: The practical difference between UPV and DPV is in the configurations (UPV has single axis tracking while DPV is fixed tilt equaling to latitude) and the smoothing (both are run through a low-pass filter, the DPV will have more of the high frequency variability smoothed out).

Capacity: Installed capacity in MW
Time Interval: PV generation data reading interval in minutes.

Sound-based_drone_fault_classification_using_multi,Sound-based drone fault classification using multitask learning Dataset,"arxiv : https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11708

Accepted at 29th International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV29). 

The drone has been used for various purposes including military applications, aerial photography, and pesticide spraying. However, the drone is vulnerable to external disturbances, and malfunction in propellers and motors can easily occur. To improve the safety of drone operations, early detection of mechanical faults should be made in real-time. In this paper, we propose a sound-based deep neural network (DNN) fault classifier and drone sound dataset. The dataset was constructed by collecting the operating sounds of drones from microphones mounted on three different drones in an anechoic chamber. The dataset includes various operating conditions of drones, such as flight directions (front, back, right, left, clockwise, counter clockwise) and faults on propellers and motors. The drone sounds were then mixed with noises recorded in five different spots on the university campus, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varying from 10 dB to 15 dB. Using the acquired dataset, we train a DNN classifier, 1DCNN-ResNet, that classifies the types of mechanical faults and their locations from short-time input waveforms. We employ multitask learning (MTL) and incorporate the direction classification task as an auxiliary task to make the classifier learn more general audio features. The test over unseen data reveals that the proposed multitask model can successfully classify faults in drones and outperforms single-task models even with less training data.

SpaceSGG,SpaceSGG Dataset,"Scene Graph Generation (SGG) converts visual scenes into structured graph representations, providing deeper scene understanding for complex vision tasks. However, existing SGG models often overlook essential spatial relationships and struggle with generalization in open-vocabulary contexts. To address these limitations, we propose LLaVA-SpaceSGG, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for open-vocabulary SGG with enhanced spatial relation modeling. To train it, we collect the SGG instruction-tuning dataset, named SpaceSGG. This dataset is constructed by combining publicly available datasets and synthesizing data using open-source models within our data construction pipeline. It combines object locations, object relations, and depth information, resulting in three data formats: spatial SGG description, question-answering, and conversation. To enhance the transfer of MLLMs' inherent capabilities to the SGG task, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. Experiments show that LLaVA-SpaceSGG outperforms other open-vocabulary SGG methods, boosting recall by 8.6% and mean recall by 28.4% compared to the baseline.

Resolution: 1000×1000 pixels, aligning with state-of-the-art spike camera imaging standards.
Temporal Depth: The dataset captures the temporal dynamics of scenes with high-speed motion, providing a temporal sequence of spike frames.
Content: It includes both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering a diverse range of high-speed motion scenarios for training and testing image reconstruction models.
Pairs: The dataset comprises 1200 spike stream-ground truth image pairs for training and 45 pairs for testing, ensuring robust model evaluation.

Motivation and Content Summary
The development of the Spike-X4K Dataset was motivated by the need for a more representative and higher resolution dataset that could effectively train and evaluate image reconstruction models for spike cameras. Spike cameras, with their unique ability to capture photons independently at each pixel and generate binary spike streams, offer high temporal resolution and low latency, which are crucial for high-speed imaging. However, converting these spike streams into high-quality images requires sophisticated algorithms, and the Spike-X4K Dataset provides the necessary data to develop and refine these algorithms.

Potential Use Cases

Algorithm Development: For researchers and engineers working on spike image reconstruction algorithms specific to spike camera data.
Benchmarking: As a standard for benchmarking the performance of various image reconstruction models against state-of-the-art techniques.
Training and Testing: Providing a large and diverse set of data for training deep learning models to handle high-speed motion imaging.
Feature Extraction: Enabling the study and improvement of feature extraction techniques from spike streams, including spatial and temporal features.
Spike Image Reconstruction Tasks: Supporting a wide range of computer vision tasks that can benefit from high-resolution, high-speed imaging, such as motion analysis, object tracking, and event detection.",https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/SwinSF,EditUnknown,"3D, Image",,,,,,"train and evaluate image reconstruction models for spike cameras.

SportsMOT,SportsMOT Dataset,"Motivation
Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to estimate objects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles) bounding boxes and identities in video sequences.

Prevailing human-tracking MOT datasets mainly focus on pedestrians in crowded street scenes (e.g., MOT17/20) or dancers in static scenes (DanceTrack). 

In spite of the increasing demands for sports analysis, there is a lack of multi-object tracking datasets for a variety of sports scenes, where the background is complicated, players possess rapid motion and the camera lens moves fast.

To this purpose, we propose a large-scale multi-object tracking dataset named SportsMOT, consisting of 240 video clips from 3 categories (i.e., basketball, football and volleyball). 

The objective is to only track players on the playground (i.e., except for a number of spectators, referees and coaches) in various sports scenes. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the community to concentrate more on the complicated sports scenes.

SportsPose,SportsPose Dataset,"Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website. We hope that SportsPose will allow researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more effective models for the analysis of sports performance and injury prevention.

Recent advances in inverse rendering have enabled a wide range of real-world applications in 3D content generation, moving rapidly from research and commercial use cases to consumer devices. While the results continue to improve, there is no real-world benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of various inverse rendering methods. Existing real-world datasets typically only consist of the shape and multi-view images of objects, which are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of material recovery and object relighting. Methods capable of recovering material and lighting often resort to synthetic data for quantitative evaluation, which on the other hand does not guarantee generalization to complex real-world environments. We introduce a new dataset of real-world objects captured under a variety of natural scenes with ground-truth 3D scans, multi-view images, and environment lighting. Using this dataset, we establish the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for object inverse rendering tasks from in-the-wild scenes, and compare the performance of various existing methods.",https://stanfordorb.github.io/,EditUnknown,"3D, Image, Time Series",,,,,,"valuating the quality of material recovery and object relighting.

STPLS3D,STPLS3D Dataset,"Our project (STPLS3D) aims to provide a large-scale aerial photogrammetry dataset with synthetic and real annotated 3D point clouds for semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

Although various 3D datasets with different functions and scales have been proposed recently, it remains challenging for individuals to complete the whole pipeline of large-scale data collection, sanitization, and annotation (e.g., semantic and instance labels). Moreover, the created datasets usually suffer from extremely imbalanced class distribution or partial low-quality data samples. Motivated by this, we explore the procedurally synthetic 3D data generation paradigm to equip individuals with the full capability of creating large-scale annotated photogrammetry point clouds. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic aerial photogrammetry point clouds generation pipeline that takes full advantage of open geospatial data sources and off-the-shelf commercial packages. Unlike generating synthetic data in virtual games, where the simulated data usually have limited gaming environments created by artists, the proposed pipeline simulates the reconstruction process of the real environment by following the same UAV flight pattern on a wide variety of synthetic terrain shapes and building densities, which ensure similar quality, noise pattern, and diversity with real data. In addition, the precise semantic and instance annotations can be generated fully automatically, avoiding the expensive and time-consuming manual annotation process.  Based on the proposed pipeline, we present a richly-annotated synthetic 3D aerial photogrammetry point cloud dataset, termed STPLS3D, with more than 16 km^2 of landscapes and up to 18 fine-grained semantic categories. For verification purposes, we also provide a parallel dataset collected from four areas in the real environment.",https://www.stpls3d.com/,EditUnknown,"3D, Image",,,,,,,,"3D Instance Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, 3D Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation, Semantic Segmentation, 3D Semantic Segmentation","3d-open-vocabulary-instance-segmentation-on-3, 3d-semantic-segmentation-on-stpls3d, 3d-instance-segmentation-on-stpls3d",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/stpls3d,Computer Vision,3D Instance Segmentation,3D Instance Segmentation

In ""part II"" extension, we include 808 experimental time-lapse image sequences of beating hiPSC-based cardiac microbundles using FibroTUG platforms [2] (""Type2""). 

Description of the data and file structure
We include here 732 examples of ""Type 1"" tissue. We share the raw videos in "".tif"" format and organize them based on: 1) platform type (""Type 1""), 2) experimental conditions under which the microbundles were grown (""condition_000"", ""condition_001"",...), and 3) the batch of differentiated CMs (""batch_000"", ""batch_001"",...) and is reflected in the folder naming.

Additionally, we include a metadata file (""metadata_type1.csv"") that includes the ""file_name"", ""experimental_conditions"", ""batch"", ""comments"", and ""included_in_plot"". While ""file_name"", ""experimental_conditions"", and ""batch"" are straightforward to comprehend, ""comments"" correspond to remarks regarding running each specific example with MicroBundlePillarTrack software available on GitHub. The ""included_in_plot"" column is used to indicate if the example was included (marked by ""1"") or not (marked by ""0"") in the summary output plot included in the main figure of the accompanying manuscript. We note that the keys for the number coded entries in ""experimental_conditions"" and ""comments"" are included in ""Type1_experimental_conditions.pdf"" and ""Comments_key.pdf"" files. 

Code/Software
We publish this dataset to accompany our pillar tracking software (MicroBundlePillarTrack) published on GitHub. In fact, we have tested our pipeline on all 1540 examples included in this dataset and the FibroTUG platforms: Time-lapse microscopy dataset of engineered cardiac microbundles dataset.

SugarCrepe__,SugarCrepe++ Dataset,"The SUGARCREPE++ dataset evaluates the sensitivity of vision language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs) to semantic and lexical alterations. 
Each sample in the SugarCrepe++ dataset consists of an image and a corresponding triplet of captions: a pair of semantically equivalent but lexically different positive captions and one hard negative caption. This poses a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence problem to the language models. The SUGARCREPE dataset consists of (only) one positive and one hard negative caption for each image. Relative to the negative caption, a single positive caption can either have low or high lexical overlap. The original SUGARCREPE only captures the high overlap case. To evaluate the sensitivity of encoded semantics to lexical alteration, we require an additional positive caption with a different lexical composition. SUGARCREPE++ fills this gap by adding an additional positive caption enabling a more thorough assessment of models’ abilities to handle semantic content and lexical variation.",https://github.com/Sri-Harsha/scpp,EditCC BY 4.0,,,,,,,,,Semantic Similarity,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sugarcrepe,Methodology,Semantic Similarity,Semantic Similarity

SuMe,SuMe Dataset,"Can language models read biomedical texts and explain the biomedical mechanisms discussed? In this work we introduce a biomedical mechanism summarization task. Biomedical studies often investigate the mechanisms behind how one entity (e.g., a protein or a chemical) affects another in a biological context. The abstracts of these publications often include a focused set of sentences that present relevant supporting statements regarding such relationships, associated experimental evidence, and a concluding sentence that summarizes the mechanism underlying the relationship. We leverage this structure and create a summarization task, where the input is a collection of sentences and the main entities in an abstract, and the output includes the relationship and a sentence that summarizes the mechanism. Using a small amount of manually labeled mechanism sentences, we train a mechanism sentence classifier to filter a large biomedical abstract collection and create a summarization dataset with 22k instances. We also introduce conclusion sentence generation as a pretraining task with 611k instances. We benchmark the performance of large bio-domain language models. We find that while the pretraining task help improves performance, the best model produces acceptable mechanism outputs in only 32% of the instances, which shows the task presents significant challenges in biomedical language understanding and summarization.",https://stonybrooknlp.github.io/SuMe/,EditUnknown,Text,English,,,,22k instances,,,"Explanation Generation, Text Summarization, Biomedical Information Retrieval",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sume,Natural Language Processing,Explanation Generation,Explanation Generation

SUN,SUN Dataset,"When glancing at a magazine, or browsing the Internet, we are continuously being exposed to photographs. Despite of this overflow of visual information, humans are extremely good at remembering thousands of pictures along with some of their visual details. But not all images are equal in memory. Some stitch to our minds, and other are forgotten. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting how memorable an image will be. We show that memorability is a stable property of an image that is shared across different viewers. We introduce a database for which we have measured the probability that each picture will be remembered after a single view. We analyze image features and labels that contribute to making an image memorable, and we train a predictor based on global image descriptors. We find that predicting image memorability is a task that can be addressed with current computer vision techniques.

SupplyGraph,SupplyGraph Dataset,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graphlike in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problem using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

Synthetic_Object_Preference_Adaptation_Data,Synthetic Object Preference Adaptation Data Dataset,"This dataset involves a 2D or 3D agent moving from a start to goal pose while interacting with nearby objects. These objects can influence position of the agent via attraction or repulsion forces as well as influence orientation via attraction to object's orientation. This dataset can be used to pre-train general policy behavior, which can be later fine-tuned quickly for a person's specific preferences. Example use-cases include:
- self-driving cars maintaining distance from other cars
- robot pick-and-place tasks with intermediate subtasks (ie: scanning factory items  before dropping them off)

Overall, pre-training initial policy behavior to be fine-tuned later is a powerful paradigm and is arguably essential for robots to handle changing environments and user preferences. This is compared to the paradigm of training on massive amounts of data and remaining fixed at test time, hoping that generalization alone will help the agent handle new scenarios.",https://github.com/Alvinosaur/opa,EditMIT,,,,,,,,,"Industrial Robots, Robot Navigation, Robot Task Planning",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/synthetic-object-preference-adaptation-data,Methodology,Industrial Robots,Industrial Robots

TableBank,TableBank Dataset,"To address the need for a standard open domain table benchmark dataset, the author propose a novel weak supervision approach to automatically create the TableBank, which is orders of magnitude larger than existing human labeled datasets for table analysis. Distinct from traditional weakly supervised training set, our approach can obtain not only large scale but also high quality training data.

Nowadays, there are a great number of electronic documents on the web such as Microsoft Word (.docx) and Latex (.tex) files. These online documents contain mark-up tags for tables in their source code by nature. Intuitively, one can manipulate these source code by adding bounding box using the mark-up language within each document. For Word documents, the internal Office XML code can be modified where the borderline of each table is identified. For Latex documents, the tex code can be also modified where bounding boxes of tables are recognized. In this way, high-quality labeled data is created for a variety of domains such as business documents, official fillings, research papers etc, which is tremendously beneficial for large-scale table analysis tasks.

The TableBank dataset totally consists of 417,234 high quality labeled tables as well as their original documents in a variety of domains.",https://github.com/doc-analysis/TableBank,EditUnknown,"Image, Tabular",,,,,,,,Table Detection,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tablebank,Computer Vision,Table Detection,Table Detection

Tamil_Memes,Tamil Memes Dataset,"Social media are interactive platforms that facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas or other forms of expression among people. This exchange is not free from offensive, trolling or malicious contents targeting users or communities. One way of trolling is by making memes, which in most cases combines an image with a concept or catchphrase. The challenge of dealing with memes is that they are region-specific and their meaning is often obscured in humour or sarcasm. To facilitate the computational modelling of trolling in the memes for Indian languages, we created a meme dataset for Tamil (TamilMemes). We annotated and released the dataset containing suspected trolls and not-troll memes. In this paper, we use the a image classification to address the difficulties involved in the classification of troll memes with the existing methods. We found that the identification of a troll meme with such an image classifier is not feasible which has been corroborated with precision, recall and F1-score.",https://zenodo.org/record/4765573,EditUnknown,Image,,,,,,,,Meme Classification,meme-classification-on-tamil-memes,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tamil-memes,Computer Vision,Meme Classification,Meme Classification

TASD,TASD Dataset,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to detect the targets (which are composed by continuous words), aspects and sentiment polarities in text. Published datasets from SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 reveal that a sentiment polarity depends on both the target and the aspect. However, most of the existing methods consider predicting sentiment polarities from either targets or aspects but not from both, thus they easily make wrong predictions on sentiment polarities. In particular, where the target is implicit, i.e., it does not appear in the given text, the methods predicting sentiment polarities from targets do not work. To tackle these limitations in ABSA, this paper proposes a novel method for target-aspect-sentiment joint detection. It relies on a pre-trained language model and can capture the dependence on both targets and aspects for sentiment prediction. Experimental results on the SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 restaurant datasets show that the proposed method achieves a high performance in detecting target-aspect-sentiment triples even for the implicit target cases; moreover, it even outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for those subtasks of target-aspect-sentiment detection that they are competent to.",https://github.com/sysulic/TAS-BERT,EditUnknown,Text,English,2015,,,,,,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-absa-on-tasd,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tasd,Natural Language Processing,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

TED_Gesture_Dataset,TED Gesture Dataset Dataset,"Co-speech gestures are everywhere. People make gestures
when they chat with others, give a public speech, talk on a
phone, and even think aloud. Despite this ubiquity, there are
not many datasets available. The main reason is that it is
expensive to recruit actors/actresses and track precise body
motions. There are a few datasets available (e.g., MSP
AVATAR [17] and Personality Dyads Corpus [18]), but their
sizes are limited to less than 3 h, and they lack diversity in
speech content and speakers. The gestures also could be
unnatural owing to inconvenient body tracking suits and acting
in a lab environment.

Thus, we collected a new dataset of co-speech gestures: the
TED Gesture Dataset. TED is a conference where people share
their ideas from a stage, and recordings of these talks are
available online. Using TED talks has the following
advantages compared to the existing datasets:

• Large enough to learn the mapping from speech to
gestures. The number of videos continues to grow.
• Various speech content and speakers. There are
thousands of unique speakers, and they talk about their
own ideas and stories.
• The speeches are well prepared, so we expect that the
speakers use proper hand gestures.
• Favorable for automation of data collection and
annotation. All talks come with transcripts, and flat
background and steady shots make extracting human
poses with computer vision technology easier.",https://github.com/youngwoo-yoon/youtube-gesture-dataset,EditBSD-3,Text,English,,,,,,,Gesture Generation,gesture-generation-on-ted-gesture-dataset,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ted-gesture-dataset,Natural Language Processing,Gesture Generation,Gesture Generation
Teeth3DS_,Teeth3DS+ Dataset,"Intraoral 3D scans analysis is a fundamental aspect of Computer-Aided Dentistry (CAD) systems,
playing a crucial role in various dental applications, including teeth segmentation, detection, labeling,

manual adjustments by dental professionals. However, developing robust automated tools for these
tasks remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of high-quality public datasets and
benchmarks. This article introduces Teeth3DS+, the first comprehensive public benchmark designed
to advance the field of intraoral 3D scan analysis. Developed as part of the 3DTeethSeg 2022 and

The_COLOSSEUM,The COLOSSEUM Dataset,"To realize effective large-scale, real-world robotic applications, we must evaluate how well our robot policies adapt to changes in environmental conditions. Unfortunately, a majority of studies evaluate robot performance in environments closely resembling or even identical to the training setup.

We present Colosseum, a novel simulation benchmark,with 20 diverse manipulation tasks, that enables systematical evaluation of models across 12 axes of environmental perturbations. These perturbations include changes in color, texture, and size of objects, table-tops, and backgrounds; we also vary lighting, distractors, and camera pose. Using Colosseum, we compare 4 state-of-the-art manipulation models to reveal that their success rate degrades between 30-50% across these perturbation factors.

When multiple perturbations are applied in unison, the success rate degrades > 75%. We identify that changing the number of distractor objects, target object color, or lighting conditions are the perturbations that reduce model performance the most. To verify the ecological validity of our results, we show that our results in simulation are correlated (R2 = 0.614) to similar perturbations in real-world experiments. We open source code for others to use Colosseum, and also release code to 3D print the objects used to replicate the real-world perturbations. Ultimately, we hope that Colosseum will serve as a benchmark to identify modeling decisions that systematically improve generalization for manipulation.",https://robot-colosseum.github.io/,EditUnknown,,,,,,,,,Robot Manipulation Generalization,robot-manipulation-generalization-on-the,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/the-colosseum,Methodology,Robot Manipulation Generalization,Robot Manipulation Generalization

ThreeDWorld_Transport_Challenge,ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge Dataset,"ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge is a visually-guided and physics-driven task-and-motion planning benchmark. In this challenge, an embodied agent equipped with two 9-DOF articulated arms is spawned randomly in a simulated physical home environment. The agent is required to find a small set of objects scattered around the house, pick them up, and transport them to a desired final location. Several containers are positioned around the house that can be used as tools to assist with transporting objects efficiently. To complete the task, an embodied agent must plan a sequence of actions to change the state of a large number of objects in the face of realistic physical constraints.

Overview
The data is divided into two groups:
- Training set (train.csv):
  Used to build machine learning models. It includes the outcome (also called the ""ground truth"") for each passenger, allowing models to predict survival based on “features” like gender and class. Feature engineering can also be applied to create new features.
- Test set (test.csv):
  Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data. The ground truth is not provided; the task is to predict survival for each passenger in the test set using the trained model.

Additionally, gender_submission.csv is provided as an example submission file, containing predictions based on the assumption that all and only female passengers survive.

This way, the models are evaluated in the context of their use, by essentially simulating
topic modeling in a fixed setting defined by a text collection and a set of reference topics.

Reference topics represent a ground truth that can be used to evaluate both topic models and other measures of model performance.
The coverage approach enables large-scale automatic evaluation of both existing and future topic models.

The topic coverage dataset consists of two text collections and two sets of reference topics.
These two sub-datasets correspond to two domains (news text and biological text) 
where topic models are used for topic discovery in large text collections.
The reference topics consist of model-generated topics inspected, selected, and curated by humans.

Each dataset contains a corpus of preprocessed (tokenized) texts and a set of reference topics, 
each represented by a list of words and text documents.
The dataset details, including the instruction for the use of the data and supporting code, are here:

TOPv2 is a multi-domain task-oriented semantic parsing dataset. It is an extension to the TOP dataset (http://fb.me/semanticparsingdialog) with 6 additional domains and 137k new samples.

In total, TOPv2 has 8 domains (alarm, event, messaging, music, navigation, reminder, timer, weather) and 180k samples randomly split into train, eval, and test sets for each domain. Please refer to the paper for more data statistics.
Note: As TOPv2 data is provided on a per-domain basis, the UNSUPPORTED utterances in the original TOP dataset were removed as they could not be mapped to any domain.

The training, evaluation and test sets for each domain are provided as tab-separated value (TSV) files with file names of ""domain_split.tsv"".
The first row of each file contains the column headers, while each following row is of the format:
domain <tab> utterance <tab> semantic_parse
where the semantic_parse follows the same format as the original TOP dataset.

The trajectory data is recorded using an on-site setup that includes an ADS-B receiver. The trajectory data provided spans days from 18 Sept 2020 till 23 Apr 2021 and includes a total of 111 days of data discounting downtime, repairs, and bad weather days with no traffic. Data is collected starting at 1:00 AM local time to 11:00 PM local time. The dataset uses an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) receiver placed within the airport premises to capture the trajectory data. The receiver uses both the 1090 MHz and 978 MHz frequencies to listen to these broadcasts. The ADS-B uses satellite navigation to produce accurate location and timestamp for the targets which is recorded on-site using our custom setup. Weather data during the data collection time period is also included for environmental context. The weather data is obtained post-hoc using the METeorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR) strings generated by the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) system at KBTP. The raw METAR string is then appended to the raw trajectory data by matching the closest UTC timestamps.

We also provide processed data that filters, interpolates and transforms data from a global frame to an airport-centred inertial frame. The inertial frame is centred at one end of the runway with the x-axis along the runway. Trajectories are filtered with aircrafts under 6000 ft MSL and around a 5km radius around the airport origin. We also remove duplicates and interpolate data every second.

TrajNet,TrajNet Dataset,"The TrajNet Challenge represents a large multi-scenario forecasting benchmark. The challenge consists on  predicting 3161 human trajectories, observing for each trajectory 8 consecutive ground-truth values (3.2 seconds) i.e., t−7,t−6,…,t, in world plane coordinates (the so-called world plane Human-Human protocol) and forecasting the following 12 (4.8 seconds), i.e., t+1,…,t+12. The 8-12-value protocol is consistent with the most trajectory forecasting approaches, usually focused on the 5-dataset ETH-univ + ETH-hotel + UCY-zara01 + UCY-zara02 + UCY-univ. Trajnet extends substantially the 5-dataset scenario by diversifying the training data, thus stressing the flexibility and generalization one approach has to exhibit when it comes to unseen scenery/situations. In fact, TrajNet is a superset of diverse datasets that requires to train on four families of trajectories, namely 1) BIWI Hotel (orthogonal bird’s eye flight view, moving people), 2) Crowds UCY (3 datasets, tilted bird’s eye view, camera mounted on building or utility poles, moving people), 3) MOT PETS (multisensor, different human activities) and 4) Stanford Drone Dataset (8 scenes, high orthogonal bird’s eye flight view, different agents as people, cars etc. ), for a total of 11448 trajectories.

TriviaHG,TriviaHG Dataset,"Nowadays, individuals tend to engage in dialogues with Large Language Models, seeking answers to their questions. In times when such answers are readily accessible to anyone, the stimulation and preservation of human’s cognitive abilities, as well as the assurance of maintaining good reasoning skills by humans becomes crucial. This study addresses such needs by proposing hints (instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution. We introduce a framework for the automatic hint generation for factoid questions, employing it to construct TriviaHG, a novel large-scale dataset featuring 160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions from the TriviaQA dataset. Additionally, we present an automatic evaluation method that measures the Convergence and Familiarity quality attributes of hints. To evaluate the TriviaHG dataset and the proposed evaluation method, we enlisted 10 individuals to annotate 2,791 hints and tasked 6 humans with answering questions using the provided hints. The effectiveness of hints varied, with success rates of 96%, 78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively. Moreover, the proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a robust correlation with annotators’ results. Conclusively, the findings highlight three key insights: the facilitative role of hints in resolving unknown questions, the dependence of hint quality on answer difficulty, and the feasibility of employing automatic evaluation methods for hint assessment.",https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/TriviaHG,EditMIT License,Text,English,,,,,,,"Hint Generation, Large Language Model, Question Answering, Information Retrieval",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/triviahg,Natural Language Processing,Hint Generation,Hint Generation

UnOfficial website: https://exposing.ai/uccs

Face detection and recognition benchmarks have shifted toward more difficult environments. The challenge presented in this paper addresses the next step in the direction of automatic detection and identification of people from outdoor surveillance cameras. While face detection has shown remarkable success in images collected from the web, surveillance cameras include more diverse occlusions, poses, weather conditions and image blur. Although face verification or closed-set face identification have surpassed human capabilities on some datasets, open-set identification is much more complex as it needs to reject both unknown identities and false accepts from the face detector. We show that unconstrained face detection can approach high detection rates albeit with moderate false accept rates. By contrast, open-set face recognition is currently weak and requires much more attention.",https://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface/,EditUnknown,Image,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02337,https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02337,,,,"Open Set Learning, Face Detection, open-set classification, Face Recognition",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/uccs,Computer Vision,Open Set Learning,Open Set Learning

All the images were captured by the participant using their own smartphone through a mobile application (app) developed by the authors.
There are 15 samples from each subject's eye, obtained in 3 sessions (5 images per session) with a minimum interval of 8 hours between the sessions.

The images were collected from June 2019 to January 2020 and have several resolutions varying from 360×160 to 1862×1008 pixels – depending on the mobile device used to capture the image. In total, the dataset has images captured from 196 different mobile devices.

Each subject captured their images using the same device model. This dataset's main intra- and inter-class variability are caused by lighting variation, occlusion, specular reflection, blur, motion blur, eyeglasses, off-angle, eye-gaze, makeup, and facial expression.

The authors manually annotated the eye corner of all images with 4 points (inside and outside eye corners) and used it to normalize the periocular region regarding scale and rotation.

UNIPD-BPE,UNIPD-BPE Dataset,"The University of Padova Body Pose Estimation dataset (UNIPD-BPE) is an extensive dataset for multi-sensor body pose estimation containing both single-person and multi-person sequences with up to 4 interacting people
A network with 5 Microsoft Azure Kinect RGB-D cameras is exploited to record synchronized high-definition RGB and depth data of the scene from multiple viewpoints, as well as to estimate the subjects’ poses using the Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK.
Simultaneously, full-body Xsens MVN Awinda inertial suits allow obtaining accurate poses and anatomical joint angles, while also providing raw data from the 17 IMUs required by each suit.
All the cameras and inertial suits are hardware synchronized, while the relative poses of each camera with respect to the inertial reference frame are calibrated before each sequence to ensure maximum overlap of the two sensing systems outputs.

The setup used allowed to record synchronized 3D poses of the persons on the scene both via Xsens’ inverse kinematics algorithm (inertial motion capture) and by exploiting the Azure Kinect Body tracking SDK (markerless motion capture), simultaneously.
The additional raw data (RGB, depth, camera network configuration) allow the user to assess the performance of any custom markerless motion capture algorithm (based on RGB, depth, or both).
Further analyses can be progressed by varying the number of cameras being used and/or their resolution and frame rate.
Moreover, raw angular velocities, linear accelerations, magnetic fields, and orientations from each IMU allow to develop and test multimodal BPE approaches focused on merging visual and inertial data.
Finally, the precise body dimensions of each subject are provided.
They include body height, weight, and segment lengths measured before the beginning of a recording session.
They were used to scale the Xsens biomechanical model, and also constitute a ground truth for assessing the markerless BPE accuracy on estimating each subject’s body dimensions.

The recorded sequences include 15 participants performing a set of 12 ADLs (e.g., walking, sitting, and jogging).
The actions were chosen to present different challenges to BPE algorithms, including different movement speeds, self-occlusions, and complex body poses.
Moreover, multi-person sequences, with up to 4 people performing a set of 7 different actions, are provided.
Such sequences offer challenging scenarios where multiple self-occluded persons move and interact in a restricted space.
They allow assessing the accuracy of multi-person tracking algorithms, focused on maintaining frame-by-frame consistent IDs of each detected person.

A total of 13.3h of RGB, depth, and markerless BPE data are present in the dataset, corresponding to over 1,400,000 frames obtained from a calibrated network with 5 RGB-D cameras.

The dataset includes fake&real news propagation (retweet) networks on Twitter built according to fact-check information from Politifact and Gossipcop.
The news retweet graphs were originally extracted by FakeNewsNet.
Each graph is a hierarchical tree-structured graph where the root node represents the news; the leaf nodes are Twitter users who retweeted the root news.
A user node has an edge to the news node if he/she retweeted the news tweet. Two user nodes have an edge if one user retweeted the news tweet from the other user. 

We crawled near 20 million historical tweets from users who participated in fake news propagation in FakeNewsNet to generate node features in the dataset.
We incorporate four node feature types in the dataset, the 768-dimensional bert and 300-dimensional spacy features 
are encoded using pretrained BERT and spaCy word2vec, respectively.
The 10-dimensional profile feature is obtained from a Twitter account's profile.
You can refer to profile_feature.py for profile feature extraction.
The 310-dimensional content feature is composed of a 300-dimensional user comment word2vec (spaCy) embedding plus a 10-dimensional profile feature.

The dataset statistics is shown below:

| Data  | #Graphs  | #Fake News| #Total Nodes  | #Total Edges  | #Avg. Nodes per Graph  |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Politifact | 314   |   157    |  41,054  | 40,740 |  131 |
| Gossipcop |  5464  |   2732   |  314,262  | 308,798  |  58  |

Please refer to the paper for more details about the UPFD dataset.

Due to the Twitter policy, we could not release the crawled user's historical tweets publicly.
To get the corresponding Twitter user information, you can refer to the news lists under \data in our github repo
and map the news id to FakeNewsNet.
Then, you can crawl the user information by following the instruction on FakeNewsNet.

The images are divided into 4 major categories — shoes, sandals, slippers, and boots — followed by functional types and individual brands. The shoes are centered on a white background and pictured in the same orientation for convenient analysis.
This dataset is created in the context of an online shopping task, where users pay special attentions to fine-grained visual differences. For instance, it is more likely that a shopper is deciding between two pairs of similar men's running shoes instead of between a woman's high heel and a man's slipper. GIST and LAB color features are provided. In addition, each image has 8 associated meta-data (gender, materials, etc.) labels that are used to filter the shoes on Zappos.com.
We introduced this dataset in the context of a pairwise comparison task, where the goal is to predict which of two images more strongly exhibits a visual attribute. When given a novel image pair, we want to answer the question, “Does Image A contain more or less of an attribute than Image B?” Both training and evaluation are performed using pairwise labels.
However, the usefulness of this dataset extends beyond the comparison task that we’ve demonstrated. The meta-data labels and the large size of the dataset makes it suitable for other tasks as well, such as:

VC-Clothes,VC-Clothes Dataset,"Person re-identification (Reid) is now an active research topic for AI-based video surveillance applications such as specific person search, but the practical issue that the target person(s) may change clothes (clothes inconsistency problem) has been overlooked for long. For the first time, this paper systematically studies this problem. We first overcome the difficulty of lack of suitable dataset, by collecting a small yet representative real dataset for testing whilst building a large realistic synthetic dataset for training and deeper studies. Facilitated by our new datasets, we are able to conduct various interesting new experiments for studying the influence of clothes inconsistency. We find that changing clothes makes Reid a much harder problem in the sense of bringing difficulties to learning effective representations and also challenges the generalization ability of previous Reid models to identify persons with unseen (new) clothes. Representative existing Reid models are adopted to show informative results on such a challenging setting, and we also provide some preliminary efforts on improving the robustness of existing models on handling the clothes inconsistency issue in the data.

Vid2RealHRI_online_video_and_results_dataset,Vid2RealHRI online video and results dataset Dataset,"Introduction
This dataset was gathered during the Vid2RealHRI study of humans’ perception of robots' intelligence in the context of an incidental Human-Robot encounter. The dataset contains participants' questionnaire responses to four video study conditions, namely Baseline, Verbal, Body language, and Body language + Verbal. The videos depict a scenario where a pedestrian incidentally encounters a quadruped robot trying to enter a building. The robot uses verbal commands or body language to try to ask for help from the pedestrian in different study conditions. The differences in the conditions were manipulated using the robot’s verbal and expressive movement functionalities.

Dataset Purpose
The dataset includes the responses of human subjects about the robots' social intelligence used to validate the hypothesis that robot social intelligence is positively correlated with human compliance in an incidental human-robot encounter context. The video based dataset was also developed to obtain empirical evidence that can be used to design future real-world HRI studies.

Dataset Contents

Four videos, each corresponding to a study condition.
Four sets of Perceived Social Intelligence Scale data. Each set corresponds to one study condition
Four sets of compliance likelihood questions, each set include one Likert question and one free-form question
One set of Godspeed questionnaire data.
One set of Anthropomorphism questionnaire data.
A csv file containing the participants demographic data, Likert scale data, and text responses.
A data dictionary explaining the meaning of each of the fields in the csv file.

More details and access to this data are available from the Texas Data Repository.

Video-MME,Video-MME Dataset,"Video-MME stands for Video Multi-Modal Evaluation. It is the first-ever comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video analysis¹. This benchmark is significant because it addresses the need for a high-quality assessment of MLLMs' performance in processing sequential visual data, which has been less explored compared to their capabilities in static image understanding.

The Video-MME benchmark is characterized by its:
1. Diversity in video types, covering 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields for broad scenario generalizability.
2. Duration in the temporal dimension, including short-, medium-, and long-term videos ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, to assess robust contextual dynamics.
3. Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs such as video frames, subtitles, and audios.
4. Quality in annotations, with rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators for precise and reliable model assessment¹.

The benchmark includes 900 videos totaling 256 hours, manually selected and annotated, resulting in 2,700 question-answer pairs. It has been used to evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source image and video models¹. The findings from Video-MME highlight the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data, which is crucial for the advancement of MLLMs¹.

VisDial,VisDial Dataset,"Visual Dialog (VisDial) dataset contains human annotated questions based on images of MS COCO dataset. This dataset was developed by pairing two subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk to chat about an image. One person was assigned the job of a ‘questioner’ and the other person acted as an ‘answerer’. The questioner sees only the text description of an image (i.e., an image caption from MS COCO dataset) and the original image remains hidden to the questioner. Their task is to ask questions about this hidden image to “imagine the scene better”. The answerer sees the image, caption and answers the questions asked by the questioner. The two of them can continue the conversation by asking and answering questions for 10 rounds at max.

VisDial v1.0 contains 123K dialogues on MS COCO (2017 training set) for training split, 2K dialogues with validation images for validation split and 8K dialogues on test set for test-standard set.

TACL 2023 Paper: Visual Writing Prompts: Character-Grounded Story Generation with Curated Image Sequences

Dataset Description
<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->


The Visual Writing Prompts (VWP) dataset is designed to facilitate the development and testing of natural language processing models that generate stories based on sequences of images. This dataset comprises nearly 2,000 curated sequences of movie shots, each sequence containing between 5 to 10 images. These images are meticulously selected to ensure they depict coherent plots centered around one or more main characters, enhancing the visual narrative structure for story generation. Aligned with these image sequences are approximately 12,000 stories, which were written by crowd workers using Amazon Mechanical Turk. This setup aims to provide a rich, visually grounded storytelling context that helps models generate more coherent, diverse, and engaging stories.

The dataset is in a CSV file. The explanation of each column is in this table.

Uses
<!-- Address questions about how the dataset is intended to be used. -->


Direct Use
<!-- This section describes suitable use cases for the dataset. -->


The dataset is intended for use in natural language processing tasks, particularly for the development and evaluation of models designed to generate coherent and visually grounded stories from sequences of images.

Out-of-Scope Use
<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the dataset will not work well for. -->


The copyrights of all movie shots belong to the original copyright holders which can be found in the IMDb page of each movie. The IMDb page is indicated by the index in the imdb_id column. For example, for the first row of our data, the imdb_id is tt0112573 so the corresponding imdb page is https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/companycredits/. Do not violate the copyrights while using these images. The usage of these images is limited to academic purposes.

Dataset Creation
Curation Rationale
<!-- Motivation for the creation of this dataset. -->


The dataset was curated to improve the quality of text stories generated from image sequences, focusing on visual storytelling with coherent plots and character grounding.

Source Data
<!-- This section describes the source data (e.g. news text and headlines, social media posts, translated sentences, ...). -->


Data Collection and Processing
<!-- This section describes the data collection and processing process such as data selection criteria, filtering and normalization methods, tools and libraries used, etc. -->


The source data consists of image sequences extracted from the movie shots from the MovieNet dataset (https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/MovieNet/tree/main/raw), ensuring a coherent plot around one or more main characters.

Who are the source data producers?
<!-- This section describes the people or systems who originally created the data. It should also include self-reported demographic or identity information for the source data creators if this information is available. -->


The images were initially produced by movie production companies and extracted by authors of MovieNet. The stories are written by crowd workers. Then the stories are compiled and refined by the authors.

Annotations
<!-- If the dataset contains annotations that are not part of the initial data collection, use this section to describe them. -->


Annotation process
<!-- This section describes the annotation process such as annotation tools used in the process, the amount of data annotated, annotation guidelines provided to the annotators, interannotator statistics, annotation validation, etc. -->


Crowdworkers were asked to write stories that fit the provided image sequences. The annotation process included reviewing these stories for coherence, grammatical correctness, and alignment with the images. More details are in our paper.

Who are the annotators?
<!-- This section describes the people or systems who created the annotations. -->


The annotators were five graduate students from Saarland University. Two are native English speakers. The other three are proficient in English.

Personal and Sensitive Information
<!-- State whether the dataset contains data that might be considered personal, sensitive, or private (e.g., data that reveals addresses, uniquely identifiable names or aliases, racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions, financial or health data, etc.). If efforts were made to anonymize the data, describe the anonymization process. -->


We do not collect personal or sensitive information. Personal information like worker IDs are not released. Our anonymization process is described in our paper.

Bias, Risks, and Limitations
<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->


The stories in this dataset are in English only. Although we have tried our best to filter the images and review the stories, it is not possible to go through all the stories. There could still be biased or harmful content. Please use the dataset carefully.

WiFi packets were transmitted at a frequency of 100 Hz, and each spectrogram captures a temporal context of approximately 4 seconds (400 WiFi packets).

To assess cross-scenario and cross-system generalization, WiFi packet sequences were collected in LoS and through-wall (NLoS) scenarios, utilizing two different WiFi systems (BQ: biquad antenna and PIFA: printed inverted-F antenna). The dataset is structured accordingly:

LOS/BQ/ <- WiFi packets collected in the LoS scenario using the BQ system
LOS/PIFA/ <- WiFi packets collected in the LoS scenario using the PIFA system
NLOS/BQ/ <- WiFi packets collected in the NLoS scenario using the BQ system
NLOS/PIFA/ <- WiFi packets collected in the NLoS scenario using the PIFA system

These directories contain the raw WiFi packet time series (see Table 1). Each row represents a single WiFi packet with the complex CSI vector H being stored in the ""data"" field and the class label being stored in the ""class"" field. H is of the form [I, R, I, R, ..., I, R], where two consecutive entries represent imaginary and real parts of complex numbers (the Channel Frequency Responses of subcarriers). Taking the absolute value of H (e.g., via numpy.abs(H)) yields the subcarrier amplitudes A.",https://zenodo.org/records/13950918,EditUnknown,"Image, Video",,,,,,,,Human Activity Recognition,,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wallhack1-8k,Computer Vision,Human Activity Recognition,Human Activity Recognition

Waymo_Open_Motion_Dataset,Waymo Open Motion Dataset Dataset,"As autonomous driving systems mature, motion forecasting has received increasing attention as a critical requirement for planning. Of particular importance are interactive situations such as merges, unprotected turns, etc., where predicting individual object motion is not sufficient. Joint predictions of multiple objects are required for effective route planning. There has been a critical need for high-quality motion data that is rich in both interactions and annotation to develop motion planning models. In this work, we introduce the most diverse interactive motion dataset to our knowledge, and provide specific labels for interacting objects suitable for developing joint prediction models. With over 100,000 scenes, each 20 seconds long at 10 Hz, our new dataset contains more than 570 hours of unique data over 1750 km of roadways. It was collected by mining for interesting interactions between vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists across six cities within the United States. We use a high-accuracy 3D auto-labeling system to generate high quality 3D bounding boxes for each road agent, and provide corresponding high definition 3D maps for each scene. Furthermore, we introduce a new set of metrics that provides a comprehensive evaluation of both single agent and joint agent interaction motion forecasting models. Finally, we provide strong baseline models for individual-agent prediction and joint-prediction.

WBM,WBM Dataset,"We propose an efficient high-throughput scheme for the discovery of stable crystalline phases. Our approach is based on the transmutation of known compounds, through the substitution of atoms in the crystal structure with chemically similar ones. The concept of similarity is defined quantitatively using a measure of chemical replaceability, extracted by data-mining experimental databases. In this way we build 189,981 possible crystal phases, including 18,479 that are on the convex hull of stability. The resulting success rate of 9.72% is at least one order of magnitude better than the usual success rate of systematic high-throughput calculations for a specific family of materials, and comparable with speed-up factors of machine learning filtering procedures. As a characterization of the set of 18,479 stable compounds, we calculate their electronic band gaps, magnetic moments, and hardness. Our approach, that can be used as a filter on top of any high-throughput scheme, enables us to efficiently extract stable compounds from tremendously large initial sets, without any initial assumption on their crystal structures or chemical compositions.",https://tddft.org/bmg/data.php,EditUnknown,Time Series,,,,,,,,"Band Gap, Structured Prediction, Formation Energy",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wbm,Methodology,Band Gap,Band Gap

WDC_Block,WDC Block Dataset,"WDC Block is a benchmark for comparing the performance of blocking methods that are used as part of entity resolution pipelines.

Entity resolution aims to identify records in two datasets (A and B) that describe the same real-world entity. Since comparing all record pairs between two datasets can be computationally expensive, entity resolution is approached in two steps, blocking and matching. Blocking applies a computationally cheap method to remove non-matching record pairs and produces a smaller set of candidate record pairs reducing the workload of the matcher. During matching a more expensive pair-wise matcher produces a final set of matching record pairs. 

Existing benchmark datasets for blocking and matching are rather small with respect to the Cartesian product AxB for comparing all records and the vocabulary size. If blockers are evaluated only on these small datasets, effects resulting from a high number of records or from a large vocabulary size (large number of unique tokens that need to be indexed) may be missed. The Web Data Commons Block (WDC-Block) is a new blocking benchmark that provides much larger datasets and thus requires blockers that address these scalability challenges. WDC Block features a maximal Cartesian product of 200 billion pairs of product offers which were extracted form 3,259 e-shops.  Additionally, we provide three development sets with different sizes (~1K pairs, ~5K pairs & ~20K pairs) to experiment with different amounts of training data for the blockers.",https://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/wdc-block/,EditUnknown,,,,,,,,,"Blocking, Data Integration","blocking-on-wdc-block-small, blocking-on-wdc-block-medium, blocking-on-wdc-block-large",https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wdc-block,Methodology,Blocking,Blocking

WeiboPolls,WeiboPolls Dataset,"Dataset Description
The dataset described in the provided text is focused on social media polls collected from Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging platform. The dataset aims to empirically study social media polls and analyze user engagement patterns.

Characteristics of the Dataset

Size: The dataset consists of 20,252 polls collected from 1,860 users on Weibo.
Data Collection: The polls were obtained by sampling Weibo posts containing polls and examining the posting history of the authors. The dataset also includes comments on each post.
Sparsity: The dataset faces the challenge of sparse distribution of polls on Weibo, as less than 0.1% of the randomly gathered posts contained polls.
Content: The dataset includes user-generated polls with questions, answer choices, and corresponding votes. The polls often incorporate trendy hashtags to attract user attention and cover various topics, including social events, public emergencies (such as the COVID-19 outbreak), entertainment topics (celebrities, TV shows), and more.

Motivations and Summary
The motivation behind collecting this dataset is to explore social media polls on Weibo and analyze user engagement patterns. The study aims to understand how users interact with polls, the influence of polls on user engagement, and the types of topics that are more likely to contain polls.

The dataset provides insights into user behavior on Weibo by examining factors such as the length of posts, comments, questions, and answers. It also highlights the preference for voting over commenting as a means of expressing opinions. The dataset's analysis suggests that posts with polls tend to attract more comments, likes, and reposts compared to posts without polls.

Potential Use Cases
This dataset can be useful for various research and practical applications, such as:


Social Media Analysis: Researchers can analyze the characteristics and dynamics of social media polls, understanding how they influence user engagement and the types of topics that attract poll creation.
User Engagement Studies: The dataset allows for the exploration of user behavior and preferences when it comes to interacting with polls, providing insights into the factors that drive user engagement on social media platforms.
Trend Analysis: By examining the hashtags associated with polls, the dataset can contribute to understanding social events, public emergencies, and entertainment trends on Weibo.
Marketing and Advertising: The dataset can assist marketers and advertisers in understanding user preferences and interests, enabling them to create targeted campaigns based on the popular topics identified in the dataset.

were confirmed by comparing the recording times with a reference database. The
remaining 10 recordings were made in open exterior environments with strong
noise and interference, and were often affected by Doppler effects due to the user
walking while recording. The final dataset has 130 audio recordings in H1 and 40

WITS,WITS Dataset,"This dataset is an extension of MASAC, a multimodal, multi-party, Hindi-English code-mixed dialogue dataset compiled from the popular Indian TV show,
‘Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai’.  WITS was created by augmenting MASAC with natural language explanations for each sarcastic dialogue. The dataset consists of the transcribed sarcastic dialogues from 55 episodes of the TV show, along with audio and video multimodal signals. It was designed to facilitate Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED), a novel task aimed at generating a natural language explanation for a given sarcastic dialogue, that spells out the intended irony. Each data instance in WITS is associated with a corresponding video, audio, and textual transcript where the last utterance is sarcastic in nature. All the final selected explanations contain the following attributes:

• Sarcasm source: The speaker in the dialog who is being sarcastic.
• Sarcasm target: The person/ thing towards whom the sarcasm is directed.
• Action word: Verb/ action used to describe how the sarcasm is taking place.  e.g. mocking, insults, taunts, etc.

The task aims to evaluate systems for the translation of biomedical titles and abstracts from scientific publications. The data includes three language pairs (English ↔ Portuguese, English  ↔ Spanish, English  ↔ French) and two sub-domains of biological sciences and health sciences.

The training data consists mainly of the Scielo corpus, a parallel collection of scientific publications composed of either titles, abstracts or title and abstracts which were retrieved from the Scielo database. For the Scielo corpus, a parallel documents are provided for all language pairs in the two sub-domains, except for the English  ↔ French, where only health was considered, as there were inadequate parallel documents available for biology in that pair. The training data was aligned using the GMA alignment tool. Additionally, a corpus of parallel titles from MEDLINEⓇ for all three language pairs were provided as well as monolingual documents for the four languages, retrieved from the Scielo database. These consist of documents in the Scielo database which have no corresponding document in another language.

Word_Sense_Disambiguation__a_Unified_Evaluation_Fr,Word Sense Disambiguation: a Unified Evaluation Framework and Empirical Comparison Dataset,"The Evaluation framework of Raganato et al. 2017 includes two training sets (SemCor-Miller et al., 1993- and OMSTI-Taghipour and Ng, 2015-) and five test sets from the Senseval/SemEval series (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007; Navigli et al., 2013; Moro and Navigli, 2015), standardized to the same format and sense inventory (i.e. WordNet 3.0).

Typically, there are two kinds of approach for WSD: supervised (which make use of sense-annotated training data) and knowledge-based (which make use of the properties of lexical resources).

Supervised: The most widely used training corpus used is SemCor, with 226,036 sense annotations from 352 documents manually annotated. All supervised systems in the evaluation table are trained on SemCor. Some supervised methods, particularly neural architectures, usually employ the SemEval 2007 dataset as development set (marked by *). The most usual baseline is the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) heuristic, which selects for each target word the most frequent sense in the training data.

Knowledge-based: Knowledge-based systems usually exploit WordNet or BabelNet as semantic network. The first sense given by the underlying sense inventory (i.e. WordNet 3.0) is included as a baseline.

xView3-SAR,xView3-SAR Dataset,"Unsustainable fishing practices worldwide pose a major threat to marine resources and ecosystems. Identifying vessels that do not show up in conventional monitoring systems---known as ``dark vessels''---is key to managing and securing the health of marine environments. With the rise of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and modern machine learning (ML), it is now possible to automate detection of dark vessels day or night, under all-weather conditions. SAR images, however, require a domain-specific treatment and are not widely accessible to the ML community. Maritime objects (vessels and offshore infrastructure) are relatively small and sparse, challenging traditional computer vision approaches. We present the largest labeled dataset for training ML models to detect and characterize vessels and ocean structures in SAR imagery. xView3-SAR consists of nearly 1,000 analysis-ready SAR images from the Sentinel-1 mission that are, on average, 29,400-by-24,400 pixels each. The images are annotated using a combination of automated and manual analysis. Co-located bathymetry and wind state rasters accompany every SAR image.

For each selected YouTube music video, we extracted 10 second clips at the middle of the video for annotation. We provided annotators with only the audio corresponding to this clip. Thus, text annotations describe audio alone, not the visual content of the clip.

The dataset annotations are divided into train and test split files. As the dataset is meant mainly for evaluation, there are 3169 annotated clips from the test set and only 1000 annotated clips from the train set.",https://zenodo.org/record/8040754,"EditResearch-only, non-commercial Adobe Research License","Audio, Image, Text",English,,,,,,,"Music Recommendation, Music Captioning",,https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/youtube8m-musictextclips,Computer Vision,Music Recommendation,Music Recommendation
